We use the information you provide us to respond to your requests, customize your shopping experience, improve our interface and communicate with you.

**Automatic Information:** We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies", and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses GroundLink.com.

#### Does GroundLink.com Share the Information It Receives?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries that GroundLink.com, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

**Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:** We work closely with our affiliated businesses. In some cases, such as marketplace and auction sellers, these businesses sell offerings to you at GroundLink.com. In some cases, such as marketplace and auction sellers, these businesses sell offerings to you for GroundLink.com.

**Third-Party Service Providers:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

**Promotional Offers:** Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of GroundLink.com customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences.

**GroundLink Corporate Accounts:** If you are an employee on your employer's GroundLink Corporate Account then upon your employer's request your ride information, ride history and ride data may be shared with your employer.  In addition, ride information and your user profile can be viewed by the Administrators on your employer's GroundLink Corporate Account as well as by those Travel Arrangers who book rides on your behalf.  No other employees may view your ride information or profile.

**Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that GroundLink.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

**Protection of GroundLink.com and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of GroundLink.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.

**With Your Consent:** Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third-parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

#### How Secure Is Information About Me?

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.

We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

#### What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?

Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites.

These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.

GroundLink.com may also display targeted advertising based on personal information about users. Although GroundLink.com does not provide any personal information to advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume that users who interact with or click on a targeted advertisement meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad (for example, users in the northwestern United States who travel).

#### What Information Can I Access?

GroundLink.com gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with GroundLink.com for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.

#### What Choices Do I Have?

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such GroundLink.com features as your Profile, Account Management, Customer Reviews.

You can add or update certain information. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.

If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences in "My Preferences". (If you do not want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of GroundLink.com, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)

The Help menu on the toolbar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Website of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of GroundLink.com's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to use any GroundLink.com products and services that require you to sign in.

#### Are Children Allowed to Use GroundLink.com?

If you are under 18, you may use GroundLink.com only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.

#### Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions

If you choose to visit GroundLink.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Washington. If you have any concern about privacy at GroundLink.com, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.

Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our website frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
