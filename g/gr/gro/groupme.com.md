# GroupMe | Privacy Policy

### INTRODUCTION

GroupMe Inc. ("GroupMe") is the provider of services called GroupMe (the "Service"), accessible at http://groupme.com. GroupMe seeks to respect your privacy. This policy describes the information we collect during your use of the Service, how we use it, and how it may be shared.

### COLLECTED INFORMATION PROVIDED BY USER

GroupMe requires several pieces of personal information in order to operate as designed. Name and active phone number are required to use any GroupMe Service. We may, however, request other information, which may be required for certain Services. If you choose to use the GroupMe Services and make a purchase, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address.

### ADDITIONAL COLLECTED INFORMATION

GroupMe will also collect non-personally identifiable information as part of the service. This will typically include browser type, language preference, IP address, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. GroupMe collects this data to optimize our service to users.

GroupMe may also use cookies or web beacons to track a user's interactions with the Service. This information will be used for internal purposes only to optimize the GroupMe Service. Users can opt-out of cookies by utilizing the settings provided in their browsers.

Additionally, GroupMe collects information from its mobile phone users (who have installed the GroupMe application) in a similar manner to optimize the mobile experience. Beyond mobile phone numbers, we collect mobile screen resolution, device make and manufacturer, as well as the device's unique identifier (in the iPhone's case, a UDID).

### USE AND DISCLOSURE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION

Except as set forth in this policy, GroupMe uses provided and collected information only for internal purposes and does not disclose data to third parties. GroupMe may occasionally inform users of new releases and features via any communication methods you have provided to the Service.

Third Parties: GroupMe occasionally hires other companies (vendors) to provide limited services on its behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose than for delivering the service to GroupMe, in accordance with GroupMe's instructions and policies. However, our vendors may use aggregate data for fraud detection to help improve their services. This helps them to more accurately detect fraudulent transactions.

Advertising: GroupMe may work with advertising partners to provide users with targeted and useful contextual advertisements. These partners may set cookies which enable them to recognize your computer and compile information about you or others who use your computer. Ad networks often use this information to better target advertisements that they think will be of use to you. GroupMe's Privacy Policy solely governs the use of information and cookies set by the Service and not by any third-party advertising partners.

Transfers: GroupMe may share data internally with its affiliate companies and may disclose certain information in the event that it is merged, acquired, sold, or some of its assets are acquired. If, in GroupMe's discretion, your information will be handled in a materially different manner after such a transaction than it was by GroupMe, you may have the opportunity to opt-out of having your information shared with any acquirer.

Other: GroupMe may disclose data to respond to valid legal process from competent authorities, meet legal requirements, exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, protect GroupMe's interests, fight against fraud, and to enforce our policies or to protect anyone's rights, property, or safety.

### YOUR RESPONSIBILITY ONLINE

You should remain aware that any information you share online or via text message can be accessed by others. GroupMe is not responsible for the actions of those who obtain your content in this manner. GroupMe cannot guarantee your safety and security and you should be aware that submitting any information and using the GroupMe Service is done at your own risk.

### MANAGING YOUR PRIVACY

Users can manage their privacy on the GroupMe web site and can e-mail privacy@groupme.com for further assistance and questions regarding GroupMe Inc.'s privacy policy.

### JURISDICTION

All information passed through GroupMe is primarily handled in the United States but may from time to time be handled in any country in which GroupMe, Inc. or its affiliate companies maintain facilities. By using the Service, you agree that the handling of your personal information and any communication through the Service will be governed by the laws of the United States and any applicable state laws.

### CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY

Although most changes are likely to be minor, GroupMe may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in GroupMe's sole discretion. GroupMe encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
