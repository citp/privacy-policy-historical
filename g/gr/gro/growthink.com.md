A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. We sometimes use cookies to improve the quality of our service and to better understand how people interact with us. We do this by storing user preferences in cookies and by tracking user trends and patterns of how people search. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features or services of our website may not function properly without cookies.

-We have your consent.

-We provide such information to trusted businesses or persons for the sole purpose of processing personally identifying information on our behalf. When this is done, it is subject to agreements that oblige those parties to process such information only on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 

-When we may be required by law to disclose your personal information to protect our legal rights. We may disclose certain information to credit bureaus and similar organizations, and otherwise when permitted by law. For example, this may include:

  * An audit or examination.

We will not disclose your account information to other people or non-affiliated companies, except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy or with your consent. 

We may store and process personal information collected on our site in the United States or any other country in which we or our agents maintain facilities. By using our services, you consent to the transfer of your information among these facilities, including those located outside your country. 

In the event of a transfer of ownership of our firm, such as acquisition by or merger with another company, we will provide notice before any personally identifying information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

We may share aggregated information with others.

**Private Information Security**

We are committed to preventing others from authorizing access to your customer information, and we maintain procedures and technology designed for this purpose. We take several steps to protect the customer information we have about you, including the following:

  * We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information;
  * We restrict access to information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide you with the best possible products and services;
  * We require outside companies and independent contractors to whom we provide customer information for marketing, servicing or processing purposes to enter into a confidentiality agreement that restricts the use of such information to be used for specific purposes as intended, and prohibits the independent use of such information;
  * We update and test our technology on a regular basis in order to improve the protection of customer information;
  * We have internal procedures that limit access to customer information to only those members who are considered “authorized” personnel.
  * For your safety and protection, your credit card information is not stored on our servers. Our payment gateway provider, Infusionsoft, keeps this information encrypted and secure on your behalf.
