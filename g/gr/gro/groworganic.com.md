# Peaceful Valley Farm Supply - Privacy

Peaceful Valley Farm Supply does not share, sell or rent its mailing list to anyone, period.

Our on-line ordering system uses "cookies" to serve you better. 

When visiting our web site in the future, the information needed for ordering from PVFS (like your mailing and shipping address but **not** credit card information) will automatically come up if you place an order. However, if you were to try to order from us from a different computer, this information would not be available and would have to be retyped. The information is kept strictly confidential and will not be shared, sold or rented to anyone. 

Be aware that a possible security risk with cookies exists when placing an order over a computer installed in a public place. For example, if you go to your local cyber café and decide to place an order over the Internet on our website, the next person using the same machine and visiting our website will have access to your name, address and email information if they decide to also place an order.

**What is a cookie?** A cookie is simply data that you have provided when you filled out requested information on a web page. This information is stored on **your** computer for easy retrieval by the web site the next time you visit it, saving you the trouble of providing needed information again. Cookies can store database information, custom page settings or as in our case, information necessary to place an order.

If you have more questions about what cookies are, go to www.cookiecentral.com which is dedicated to answering questions about cookies. In addition, there are an abundance of resources on the Internet that can help you find answers to your cookie questions. Yahoo has a great listing describing cookies.
