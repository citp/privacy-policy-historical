# GrowOrganic: Respecting your Privacy

Our online ordering system uses "cookies" to serve you better.

When visiting our web site in the future, the information needed for ordering from PVFGS (like your mailing and shipping address but **not** credit card information) will automatically come up if you place an order. However, if you were to try to order from us from a different computer, this information would not be available and would have to be retyped. The information is kept strictly confidential and will not be shared, sold or rented to anyone.

Be aware that a possible security risk with cookies exists when placing an order over a computer installed in a public place. For example, if you go to your local cyber café and decide to place an order over the Internet on our web site, the next person using the same machine and visiting our web site could access your name, address and email information if they decide to also place an order.

 **What is a cookie?** A cookie is simply data stored by a web site on your computer, which the web site then has access to when you visit that web site. In our case, we store an anonymous ID number that allows us to look up information you have previously filled out in a form on our website (e.g. your name, address, and email address). This information is securely stored in our database for easy retrieval by the web site the next time you visit, saving you the trouble of providing needed information again.

If you have more questions about what cookies are, go to www.cookiecentral.com, which is dedicated to answering questions about cookies. In addition, there are an abundance of resources on the Internet that can help you find answers to your cookie questions.
