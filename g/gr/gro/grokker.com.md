# Grokker's Privacy Promise

Groxis knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting Groxis’ website, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?  
This Privacy Policy covers Groxis’ treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that Groxis gathers when you access Groxis’ website. Also, this Policy covers Groxis’ treatment of any Personal Information that Groxis’ business partners share with Groxis. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Groxis does not own or control, or to individuals that Groxis does not employ or manage. 

What Personal Information Does Groxis Collect?  
Personal Information You Provide to Us  
We receive and store Personal Information you provide through our website or in any other way, which may include names, billing addresses, credit card information, and contact information. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some features of our site. The Personal Information you provide is used for purposes such as responding to your requests for products and services and customizing the content you see. We may also use Personal Information you provide us to communicate with you about specials and new products and for other marketing purposes, but only if you have given us your permission to do so. 

Personal Information Collected Automatically  
We receive and store certain types of information from your browser whenever you interact with our website, including your IP address, Groxis cookie information (described below), and the page you requested. 

Our website automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components. Groxis only uses this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data tells us how often customers use parts of our website so that we can make improvements accordingly. We may provide such aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site and their services so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. 

email Communications  
We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Groxis if your computer supports this type of program. Groxis uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. 

What About Cookies?  
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Groxis cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to identify you, your screen name or your email address. 

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you fully to take advantage of our websiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s features, some of which will not be available if cookies are declined. 

Will Groxis Share Personal Information It Receives?  
We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only with the subsidiaries that are under control of Groxis and as described below. 

Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control  
We are affiliated and work closely with a variety of businesses that may sell items to you through Groxis’ website or that may provide services, or sell products jointly with Groxis. When an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, we may share customer information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business. 

Agents  
We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and sometimes need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. Unless we tell you differently, Groxis’ agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond the scope of their assistance to Groxis. 

Promotional Offers  
If you have given us your permission, we may send offers to certain customers on behalf of other businesses. However, when we do so, we do not give the other business your name and address. 

Business Transfers  
Customer information is one of the business assets that may be transferred if Groxis elects to buy or sell assets. Moreover, if Groxis, or substantially all of its assets or business, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Groxis goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that could be transferred to a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any successor to Groxis may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy. 

Protection of Company and Others  
We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law or protect the rights, property, or safety of Groxis, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

With Your Consent  
Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information. 

Is Personal Information About Me Secure?
