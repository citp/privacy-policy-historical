# GroupCard - Privacy Policy

WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS  
This privacy policy pertains to the use of all services related to Interactive Gift Corporation (IGC), including the IGC web site at [www.GroupCard.com](http://www.groupcard.com/)

This privacy policy covers how IGC treats personal information that IGC collects and receives. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable including but not limited to your name, address, email address, or phone number.

Children under 13 are not permitted to use any IGC services, and so this privacy policy makes no provision for children's use of the site.

IGC collects personal information when you register with IGC services, when you use IGC services or when you post content on IGC. We receive and store any information you enter on our services or give us in any other way.

When you register we may ask for your email address and certain optional information such as your name, birth date, birth place, gender, biographical information, ICQ/AIM/Yahoo/MSN user name, and personal interests. We probably won't ask you for all of this though.

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.

Email   
If you provide your email address in the course of using the IGC web site, IGC will store your email address along with a password for later use. This allows IGC to; customize your web site experience, give you the ability to edit content that you have previously created, and accumulate all of your cards on one web page for your convenience. You may reset your password at any time.

Your email address is displayed as the "from" email address when you; invite others to sign a card, send a card to a recipient, or send a group thank-you message after receiving a card.

IGC allows you to opt into an event-reminder email program. Currently this program is used to send you an email notice when your friends (those who are connected to you through a private card) have upcoming birthdays. IGC may expand this program to include weddings, new babies, graduations, holidays, and other events as appropriate. IGC may also send you updates about new features, promotions, or contests as part of this event-reminder option. IGC will endeavor to make this optional program a value to you. You may opt-out of this service at any time by following the steps below.
