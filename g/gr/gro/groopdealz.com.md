####  WHAT INFORMATION DOES GROOPDEALZ COLLECT? 

groopdealz collects certain personal information as you shop for deals or participate in other website services. We may collect your name, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address. We may also collect personal preferences regarding the type of deals you are interested in, businesses where you prefer to shop, or other information about your shopping preferences and patterns. Most of this information is only collected if you register as a groopdealz member; some of this information is optional - you don't have to provide it unless you choose to, but you can still participate in groopdealz and purchase deals. In order to make a purchase from groopdealz, we will also need to collect credit card or similar financial information to complete your purchase. 

Groopdealz may collect technical information to improve its website operation. This may include your internet protocol address or information about the browser that you are using. We may also use technical tools to facilitate statistical analysis of how our website is used. By itself, this technical information does not identify you individually. 

We may use cookies to help you move more efficiently through our website. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer when you visit our site. It does not identify you personally, but only tracks the settings, preferences, pages, or features associated with a particular Web site.
