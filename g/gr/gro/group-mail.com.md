**Privacy Policy**  


All of us at Infacta take your privacy and security very seriously. This privacy statement discloses our information practices and declares our data collection methods, usage and confidentiality policies throughout our site.

Different areas of this site may incorporate their own set of policies depending on the respective services offered and the data collection requirements.  A separate policy is described for each area.

This site is fully compliant with the [W3C Platform for Privacy Preferences Initiative](http://www.w3.org/P3P/).

**The Infacta Website - General Policy ******

**1\. Policy Scope  
**  
This policy applies to all areas of the Infacta website with the exception of the customer resources and promotions areas which are governed by separate privacy policies.  It is the responsibility of linked websites to provide their own privacy policies and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any such websites.

**2\. The Infacta Announcement Group.**  

While browsing our site you may see several opportunities to subscribe to our product announcement group, to join this we require you to provide your e-mail address. We use this address to notify you of new software releases, updates and special offers. For your convenience, each announcement contains instructions on how to be removed from all future mailings. We do not make your e-mail address available to any third parties. Please note that customers are automatically added to this list/group.

**3\. During Software Purchase.**  

It is important to note that Infacta does not process orders directly. We use reputable  ecommerce companies to do this on our behalf using the very latest in secure transmission technologies. It is very important for these companies to keep accurate purchase records. Immediately after you purchase one of our products our ecommerce partner will notify us and will pass your contact information (e.g. name, company name, postal address, email address, telephone and fax number) together with some limited purchase order information (e.g. purchase date, order reference number, product code, product name, quantity, price and any delivery options).  This data is used to enable us to email you with necessary product unlock codes, to identify you in order to give you the full benefits of your purchase including free technical support and upgrade eligibility and to enable us to set up a user account providing you with access to our customer resources area.  For security purposes the ip address of this transaction may be recorded.  Please note that we do not receive a copy of your actual payment details (such as credit card numbers or wire transfer details). We do not make any of this information available to any third parties. To learn more about our ecommerce vendors and their privacy & security policies, go to their respective web sites:

**4\. Technical Support.**

Some of our products contain technical support wizards which help us to provide a higher level of support. When you use this software you have full control over what is sent back to our support staff. You can also have an exact copy of the data being returned to us sent to you also. This information (settings, hardware spec, and log files) is only used for the purpose of support and our copy is destroyed once your issue is dealt with. 

Please note that when you contact Infacta support any details you provide us are used only to help solve any issues you have and are destroyed once your issue is dealt with. 

We do not make any of this information available to any third parties.  


**5\. Cookies.**  

The area of the site governed by this policy does not use "cookies" (which are small pieces of information that your browser stores on your computer's hard drive), with the exception of anonymous _session cookies.   _A session cookie only ever contains a unique identifier for managing session state and therefore does not contain any personally identifiable information.  Session cookies are automatically deleted when the web browser is closed. 

**The Customer Resources Area**

**1\. Policy Scope** This policy applies to the _customer resources area_ including the log-in and log-out pages. 

**2\. Authentication  & Security**

Access to the customer resources area by default is over secure SSL (https).  This means that all of the information transmitted and received by your browser while visiting this area is securely encrypted and that it is highly unlikely that anyone will be able to eavesdrop on any of your personal data.

To protect the privacy of your information all users must be authenticated using a username and password system before gaining admittance to this area. 

Users are strongly advised not to share their log-on details with others, otherwise this may result in their access to this area being terminated if we determine that there has been a breach of a user's privacy or security.  This policy is to the benefit of all legitimate users. The customer resources area is constantly monitored for any prohibited activity.

**3\. Collection & Use of Information**

The customer resources area presents a highly individualised facility for managing downloads and updates.  In order to provide this facility we have to record basic (non-financial) information about each user's choice of purchase as well as recording their usage of the facility, for example to customise the downloads remaining for each user.

To protect the customer resources area from misuse we actively monitor all logins into the system in addition to recording standard web logs.  We collect login dates and times as well as recording IP addresses on an individual basis.  In addition, we record details on all downloads that are taken, also on an individual basis.  This allows us to perform individual analysis of patterns of activity for the purposes of detecting prohibited access and misuse of the resources in the system. 

Support facilities are provided to assist users who may have problems logging in.  This may involve the user emailing to us their contact and original order information in order to provide proof of purchase.  While this information is usually discarded once the request has been fulfilled, it may be retained indefinitely in special circumstances where it might prove useful to compile a past history of such requests, for example if we suspect that a user is attempting to gain access fraudulently.

To expedite the handling of priority support emails we may record computer and browser information.  This allows us to quickly deal with common problems arising from incompatible system settings, for example if we detect that a user's browser does not support cookies.

Customers may provide suggestions via the customer feedback facility and this information may be retained indefinitely in order to serve as a valuable repository of ideas for future products and services.

Customers may view and edit their personal contact information and preferences.  We may use this information to market new releases and upgrades, and for general customer announcements.  The customer may opt-out of our marketing mailing list by modifying their contact preferences.

The customer resources area may use a number of cookies - small pieces of information that your browser stores on your computer's hard drive.  We use an anonymous temporary cookie to detect if your browser currently accepts cookies.  We also use a permanent personalisation cookie to store your greeting name when you revisit the site.  An optional third permanent cookie is used to implement the "Remember this Account" function and this cookie contains your email address.  A fourth temporary authentication cookie is used by our system in order to identify authenticated users of the system.  This is in addition to a standard session cookie as described in the general section above. 

_Please note that we do not receive or ever store any financial information such as credit card details and that none of the information we collect is ever shared with any third parties outside of our immediate ecommerce providers._

**3\. Collection & Use of Information**
