# Privacy Policy

## Who we are

Our website address is: https://www.groovypost.com. We are an independent and privately owned publisher in the United States.

## What we do

We publish daily tech news, tips, and reviews. That’s our business and in order to keep the website free vs. paid subscription or a paywall, we show ads to our readers and offer a [free newsletter](https://www.groovypost.com/emailsub/) to keep up-to-date with all our content.

## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

### Comments

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help determine if the comment is legitimate or SPAM. This information is also provided to the service [Akismet](https://akismet.com/privacy/) to check if it’s legitimate or SPAM.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

### Cookies

Although this will never make me rich, it does allow me to operate the site and keep it free for anyone who is groovy. These third-party companies may use information ( _not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number_ ) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you leave a comment on our site, you may opt-in to save your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment.

If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.

If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.
