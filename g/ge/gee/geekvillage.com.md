**Certain sections of this site log and display your IP number. This includes our geek/talk Forums For Webmasters. IP numbers are not secret and have been used for years. Every site you visit logs and often displays your IP number. We use this procedure for your protection as well as our own. It helps us protect our members from abuse, permits members of our Bulletin Board to "flush" impostors and "Abusers", provides us with the additional evidence to aggressively pursue "Abusers", and acts as a deterrent for "Abusers". If you use a Broadband connection to the Web such as Cable or DSL, you should install a firewall on your system to protect it from third party abuse. We have received good reports about[ZoneAlarm](http://www.zonelabs.com/), [BlackICE](http://www.networkice.com/index.html), and the [Linksys Router](http://www.linksys.com/). Then check the integrity of your system using [Shields UP](http://grc.com/).
