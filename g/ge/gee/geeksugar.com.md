### Cookies and Web Beacons

Some of the User Information is collected on the Services through the use of Cookies and/or Web Beacons. **"Cookies"** are small data file identifiers that are transferred to your computer or mobile web browser that allow us, and third parties with whom we partner, to recognize your browser or mobile device and transfer information about you and your use of our Services. For example, Cookies that we use tell us how many times you have visited one of our websites, your search preferences, and if you have clicked on an advertisement that has been displayed to you. We use "persistent" Cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Services. We also use "session ID" Cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session ID Cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from a Service and close your browser.

We (and third parties with whom we partner) may also deliver a file known as a web beacon, pixel or pixel tag (i.e., **"Web Beacons"** ) to you through our Services. Web Beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Services interface or in emails relating to the Services to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Services interface, such as to count visits, access Cookies, understand usage effectiveness and to determine if an email has been opened and acted upon. **"Pixels"** or **"Pixel Tags"** also known as clear GIFs, beacons, spotlight, tags or web bugs, are a method for passing information from the user's computer to a third party website. We (and third parties with whom we partner) may deliver Web Beacons or Pixel Tags to you through our Services. Web Beacons allow ad networks, marketing partners and other service providers that we use to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us, for advertisers and our other partners. Web Beacons also enable ad networks and other partners to track your behavior for their own analysis and use, and to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites or platforms. These Web Beacons enable third party companies to view, edit, or set their own Cookies when you visit the Services, just as if you had visited a web page from their site.

User Information is used to provide Services to you by POPSUGAR and its partners, which includes using such information to:

* Allow you to set up an account and profile and log into your account on the Services and to access certain parts of the Services through such account;
* Allow you to share certain information about yourself with other users through your account profile;
* For our POPSUGAR [Voices](https://www.popsugar.com/voices) or Influencer platforms, to determine what assignments or projects are a good fit for your skills and interests and to process payments for your services if you are selected for a paid assignment;
* Allow you to submit an application to become and create your account as a seller on our GLOW by POPSUGAR service;
* Personalize and improve the Services;
* Connect you across multiple devices or platforms where you are accessing our content;
* Customize the Services to provide advertisements, content, features or recommendations on the Services or on other platforms (for example, social media platforms) that match your interests or are otherwise tailored to you;
* Send you free gifts or other promotions;
* Send you notices, updates and other administrative messages;
* Process transactions and send you related information;
* Send emails or newsletters to you, which may also offer or advertise POPSUGAR or third party products and/or services;
* Administer or communicate with you about Promotions;
* Link or combine information we receive from third parties to help provide you with better service;
* Detect, investigate and/or prevent fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity;
* Analyze and monitor how our users utilize the Services; and
* Carry out other purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

We may use your User Information to contact or communicate with you, for example, by email, postal mail, notices on our websites or applications, newsletters or other means available through the Services, including push notifications and mobile text messages. Such communications may contain messages of a commercial or non-commercial nature, including but not limited to, messages necessary to provide the Services to you, responses to an inquiry that you submitted, marketing and promotional messages for our Services or the products and/or services of our partners and advertisers, messages sent for administrative purposes related to the Services, and other communications as needed to carry out other purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

When you receive email messages or newsletters from us, we may use Web Beacons, customized links, clear GIFs or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused email communications or other information, and/or aggregate such data with other data we collect for some or all of the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

We and our partners use Cookies and other tracking technologies to administer the Services, analyze trends, track users' movements around the Services and on third party sites, devices and applications, and to gather demographic information about our user base.

We may also receive certain data (on an individual and/or aggregated basis) collected by our partners (including but not limited to e-commerce partners, affiliates, and analytics providers) through the use of Pixel Tags, e-tags, IP Addresses, Local Shared Objects, Local Storage, and Browser cookies, which allows us to:

* Analyze trends across our user base;
* Collect and store information such as user settings;
* Supplement our server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement;
* Track users' location and movements around the Services; and
* Improve our understanding of traffic on the Services, visitor behavior, and responses to advertising and promotional campaigns.

POPSUGAR also works with third parties to provide analytics information regarding your usage of our Services or to help us track the advertisements that are delivered to you to determine the effectiveness of advertising on our Services. We may also link this information to User Information.

### Advertising and marketing

Certain third party vendors and partners authorized by POPSUGAR (including, but not limited to, advertisers, advertising agencies, ad networks, ad measurement providers, and other marketing and advertising service providers and partners) ( **"Advertisers"** ) may collect information about you on the Services in order to provide you with relevant advertising on the Services and on other websites, platforms and media channels, and to analyze the performance of advertising campaigns. These Advertisers may use tracking technologies such as Cookies, Web Beacons, and other similar technologies, and may collect many different kinds of data, such as your IP Address, Device ID, Advertising ID and Precise Location Data where made available by your mobile device. The specific Advertisers we work with are subject to change at any time. For a list of some of the applicable providers or for more details on opting out of tracking for advertising purposes, go to our Cookie Consent Tool by clicking on the button in the lower right corner of your screen labeled **"Cookie Consent"**. **The use of tracking technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies.**

To opt out of collection of your information by Nielsen, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit the Nielsen consumer opt out page located [here](http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy#choice).

We may also sell or transfer Interaction Data to certain Advertisers who will use this data to serve ads that they believe are relevant to your interests. Some of these third parties may combine the Interaction Data with their own data about you to form a more detailed picture. We may also share your information with Advertisers for the purpose of allowing them or their clients to send you marketing communications related to your use of the Services, their services or programs featured and/or advertised on the Services (e.g., through ads, Promotions, or Sparkle application), or their products, services and/or programs generally. For example, if you request to receive more information from an Advertiser featured in a social media post by submitting your email through the Sparkle application, we will share your email with such Advertiser to allow the Advertiser to send you future marketing communications.

Our third party vendors and partners use your User Information to display ads on both the Services and on third party websites, applications, platforms and other media channels (collectively, **"Channels"** ). For example, if you read content about a particular subject on the Services, we may use Cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a particular product or service related to the viewed content. These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on the Services with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined information. These advertisements may appear when you are visiting a different section of the Services or on another Channel. Likewise, third party vendors may serve you advertisements when you visit the Services based on your interaction with the Services and other Channels.

Some of our Services may use Facebook and Instagram features and tools, including Pixel Tags, which send data regarding your use of the Services to Facebook and/or Instagram for the purpose of tracking your interaction with the Services and with our brand on Facebook and Instagram, and to create custom audiences on the Facebook and/or Instagram platforms. Facebook and Instagram link the data collected on our Services with your account on their platforms and we and/or our Advertisers may use that data to serve you with advertisements both on and off of Facebook and Instagram.

We may provide certain Advertisers with information regarding your interactions with our emails and newsletters or as to whether your information matches certain information held by the Advertiser and/or their customers. Those Advertisers may combine this data with information they collect for their own marketing purposes and in turn, may provide this information to their customers for their customers' marketing purposes.

In order to help us sell advertising on the Services and otherwise publicize POPSUGAR and its products and services, we may share aggregate statistics that describe our online audience. Those statistics are often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse the Services and describe, among other things, the demographics of our visitors.

[Sparkle](http://sparkle.popsugar.com/) application pages are developed and hosted by POPSUGAR and licensed to Advertisers. In connection with Sparkle, you may provide certain information to us in response to specific questions and prompts, such as providing your email address to sign up for marketing emails or newsletters, or tapping or clicking on an "Add to cart" feature for specific products. Information provided through Sparkle may be stored by POPSUGAR (such as which products are added to a cart) and may be shared with the Advertiser(s) we have partnered with in connection with that Sparkle page. We may use your IP address to understand trends within a specific zip code or geographical area. Advertisers may use such information to complete your transaction or send you emails or other communications, including communications to market their products and/or services to you, or for other internal uses. When you enter information using a Sparkle "Add to cart" feature, we may share your information with a third-party retailer (who may in some cases also be an Advertiser) to complete your transaction, which is subject to such retailer's terms and conditions and privacy policy.

### Third party service providers

We employ or utilize the services of other third party vendors, consultants and service providers who need access to your User Information (such as your name, address, email, or other identifiers) in order to enable them to perform services on our behalf or to provide us with additional information necessary to provide you one of our Services to you. We use third party vendors for a variety of services across our Services, such as email message deployment, email address validation, subscription fulfillment, research, statistical analysis, cross-device user tracking, data and website hosting, marketing, advertising, and other data and transaction processing. 

We also engage third party service providers for the purpose of processing payments for purchases of content, subscriptions and physical goods through our Services, to fulfill your orders for product purchases, to honor your request to be removed from promotional mailings, and to monitor, analyze and prevent fraudulent traffic or other suspicious activities on our Services or on other services. For our [Voices](https://www.popsugar.com/voices) and Influencer platforms, we may also provide your User Information to third party processors in order to process payments for services if you are selected for a paid assignment under those platforms.

However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized persons or hardware or software failure. You are ultimately responsible for the security of your email address and password.

### Children

The Services are not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any information about yourself to us. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, please contact us at [community@popsugar.com](mailto:community@popsugar.com).

### International transfer

Your User Information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, POPSUGAR transfers personal information to the United States and processes it there. By submitting such information, you consent to that transfer.

### Data retention

The time period for which we keep information varies according to the information's use. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we plan to retain it for no longer than is necessary to fulfill a legitimate business need.
