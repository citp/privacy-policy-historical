# Privacy @ Geek Culture

**Geek Culture's Privacy Statement**  
Geek Culture uses all reasonable precautions to keep any personal information disclosed to us secure.

We recognize that most Internet users wish their email addresses and other personal information remain private. As such we **will not sell or give access** to any of this kind of information. 

Geek Culture maintains a separate double opt-in mailing list for those wishing to keep informed of updates to the site, or special promotions, and the addresses and information in that list are also kept completely confidential.

 **Cookies?**   
From time to time, we or our advertisers may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off of your computer hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you've seen an advertisement. Our advertisers and we may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you see on our site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience here and other web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.

**What else should I know about my privacy when I'm online?**  
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example through e-mail, forums, or elsewhere - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

We will do our best to keep all your information private. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
