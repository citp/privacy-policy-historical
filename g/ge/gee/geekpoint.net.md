### Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this privacy policy notice explaining our data collection practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this policy notice easy to find, we make it available in the 'Site Information Center' which can be accessed from _any_ page of this website. 

### Information we Collect

**Cookies**  
When you visit GeekPoint, we send one or more cookies to your web browser. A cookie is a small, harmless piece of information that is stored in your browser. Only the domain which set that cookie can access the information from it. (ie, other domains can't access cookies set by us and we can't access cookies set by others) 

**Server Logs**  
Whever your access a file from our website, the server logs the following data: (i) Requested File name, (ii) Your IP address, (iii) Date & Time of request, (iv) Your user agent, (v) Referring webpage (if any), and (vi) Size of the requested document. 

**Forum Account**  
In the process of creating an account on GeekPoint Forum, we ask for your EMail address. This is done to verify your identity & that you are a real human being; and not some unscrupulous bot submitting web forms across the internet. Also, each thread, post, message you create on the Forum is associated with your Forum account & stamped with your I.P. address. 

**Blog Comments**  
Comments can be made on the GeekPoint Blog without any account registration. The standard visitor information like: IP address, Email (not verified), Name (not verified) and your Website URL (optional) is logged against each comment you make on a blog post. 

**Paid Services**  
When using any of our web development / programming services; we require that you provide valid contact info (Your name, EMail address, Company/Organisation you work for) and optionally an IM (Instant Messaging) contact. If the payment is to be done via PayPal; then a valid PayPal address is required to send the service invoices. 

**Visitor Patterns**  
We use a visitor tracking and analysis service (Google Analytics) to see how our website, website sections and webpages are performing. (e.g. Unique Visitors, Page Views, Total Visitors, etc.). No personally identifiable information is collected in this process. 

**Outbound Clicks**  
We track outbound clicks from our webpages too. Again, No personally identifiable information is collected in the process. Only pure stastical information like the URI of clicked link and URI of the page from which the click was done, is stored. 

**Advertising Services**  
GeekPoint primarily uses Google Adsense to serve advertisements relevant to the webpage content. To know more about what information Google collects and uses, check out their General [Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html) and [Advertising Policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html) pages. 

### How we Use It

**E-Mail Addresses**  
EMail addresses you entered while registering on the Forum and/or while commenting on Blog posts are used to provide you updates of any content which you have subscribed to. Occasionally (once in a month or two), we send out newsletters and/or important announcements regarding the changes in website, ongoing contests, maintenance downtimes, etc. You Email addresses are safe with us. We won't sell it to anyone! 

**Passwords**  
The password which you use to login to the Forum account is salted and then encrypted before being saved in our database. It's NEVER stored in a plaintext format. This way even we can't _see_ what your password is. And that's why in case you forget your login password, we can't retrieve it for you; we are only able to change it to something else. 

**Visitor Statistics**  
Visitor statictics and data logged by the server and Google Analytics are used to improve our site. We can quickly see which pages are performing well and which of them are not. Some statistics like Total Visitors, Unique Visitors, Aggregate PageViews per month are released to public. But no personal information is ever revealed. 

**Cookies**  
Cookies are used to store your personal preferences for a short time. They are used to customise the content that is served to you on the Forum (primarily) and/or other site's sections. Cookies are also used to store your site login credentials. (So you may or may not face difficulties accessing member-only functions, if you login with cookies disabled in your browser) 

### Data Security

Appropriate measures (user authentication, authorization, data encryption) are taken to ensure that the data we collect is safeguarded and secure from unauthorized access. Regarding the data submitted in Forum: private profile fields can only be accessed by site administrators, and I.P. addresses attached to the threads/posts can only be accessed by site administrators and moderators. 

### Children's Privacy

Protecting very young children's privacy is quite important. For that very reason we currently don't allow account registrations by children under 13 years of age, on our Forum. 

### Accessing your Info

Wherever possible and feasible, we provide a way for you to edit and update your personal information. In the case of Forums, you can edit your personal information and site preferences via the UserCP _(User Control Panel)_. The various options and setting groups available to you are explained below: 

**UserCP » Edit Your Details**  
Edit your personal information like birth date, birth date visibility preference, website URI, instant messaging (IM) contacts, your Location, Occupation, Hobbies / Topics of Interest, Biography, etc. All of these fields are optional and you can clear them out anytime you want. 

**UserCP » Profile Privacy**  
You can select the user types who can access your user profile. Data which you can restrict is: Contact info, Profile picture, Visitor messages, Albums, Biography, Friends list, Recent profile visitor list and Group membership list. You can set the access level to: Everyone (Guests included), Registered Members, Users on your Contact list, Your Friends. 

**UserCP » Edit Options**  
Various options are available to customise your Forum experience. The settings groups include: Login settings, Visitor and Profile Messaging, Thread Display Options, Date / Time / Timezone selection and some Miscellaneous options like the Forum's color scheme / layout (if multiple selections are available). 

**UserCP » Edit Email & Password**  
Pretty much self explanatory. You can edit the email address associated with the Forum account; and the password which you use to login. Please note that if you update your email address, you'll have to verify that new address too.
