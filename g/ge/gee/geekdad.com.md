### Comments

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

Our website uses Google Analytics, a service which transmits website traffic data to Google servers in the United States.

By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner described in [Google’s Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) and for the purposes set out above. We honor a browser’s Do Not Track (DNT) request, however, not all browsers have that feature. You can opt out of Google Analytics if you disable or refuse the cookie, disable JavaScript, or use the following button: 

 _GeekDad_  also uses interfaces with social media sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and others. If you choose to “like” or “share” information from this website through these services, you should review the privacy policy of that service. If you are a member of a social media site, the interfaces may allow the social media site to connect your visits to this site with other Personal Information.

### Third Party Advertising

 _GeekDad_ and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our website. More specifically, our website has implemented and uses display advertising, and we utilize Google Analytics to implement a specific feature called remarketing. Remarketing is a feature of Google’s AdWords that allows us to optimize the delivery of ad content specifically targeted to a visitor’s interests based upon previous visits to our site. If you’d like more information about remarketing lists in Google Analytics please visit the following site – <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2611268>.

If you would like to opt-out of Google Analytics for display advertising you may do so by using the [Ads Preferences Manager](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/?hl=en&sig=ACi0TCimhsDbENAzTEVRyypSGTPyPKAUQ1kd19WVIvCjxTXx86BO6zY5SDokKk3R17hVCBovUPJ87O75x1AOYL9_SsAp__d5ZONrfjZ_2bVvLR4Q4nFTPXEqg1OnCl9fl-gwGH1QVCqjkX94bUX1tzQR0N6MHZIHyBU0E999AOGF1gYfDOa0iqYptntLP4Atc2kf5N1vUGnIxfNfflxYlmCj0JILp-9s4_8D3vCoivm7ez7Uk05Gzx7cWkWT2xOHMpvpVWjhzPzRpb0xnJd9VDkQNqJ7_0aiSA).

Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service, as well as scanned through our firewall to prevent the injection of malicious script and prevent linking to malicious websites.

### Data That Is Sent to Jetpack

### Activity Log

 **Data Used:** To deliver this functionality and record activities around site management, the following information is captured: user email address, user role, user login, user display name, WordPress.com and local user IDs, the activity to be recorded, the WordPress.com-connected site ID of the site on which the activity takes place, the site’s Jetpack version, and the timestamp of the activity. Some activities may also include the actor’s IP address (login attempts, for example) and user agent.

 **Activity Tracked:** Login attempts/actions, post and page update and publish actions, comment/pingback submission and management actions, plugin and theme management actions, widget updates, user management actions, and the modification of other various site settings and options. Retention duration of activity data depends on the site’s plan and activity type. [See the complete list of currently-recorded activities (along with retention information)](https://jetpackme.wordpress.com/support/activity-log/#data-retention).

 **Data Synced ([?](https://jetpack.com/support/what-data-does-jetpack-sync/)):** Successful and failed login attempts, which will include the actor’s IP address and user agent.

* * *

### Gravatar Hovercards

 **Data Used:** This feature will send a hash of the user’s email address (if logged in to the site or WordPress.com — or if they submitted a comment on the site using their email address that is attached to an active Gravatar profile) to the [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) service (also owned by [Automattic](https://automattic.com/)) in order to retrieve their profile image.

* * *

### Notifications

 **Data Used:** IP address, WordPress.com user ID, WordPress.com username, WordPress.com-connected site ID and URL, Jetpack version, user agent, visiting URL, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, country code. Some visitor-related information or activity may be sent to the site owner via this feature. This may include: email address, WordPress.com username, site URL, email address, comment content, follow actions, etc.

 **Activity Tracked:** Sending notifications (i.e. when we send a notification to a particular user), opening notifications (i.e. when a user opens a notification that they receive), performing an action from within the notification panel (e.g. liking a comment or marking a comment as spam), and clicking on any link from within the notification panel/interface.

* * *

### Sharing

 **Data Used:** When sharing content via email (this option is only available if [Akismet](https://akismet.com/) is active on the site), the following information is used: sharing party’s name and email address (if the user is logged in, this information will be pulled directly from their account), IP address (for spam checking), user agent (for spam checking), and email body/content. This content will be sent to [Akismet](https://akismet.com/) (also owned by [Automattic](https://automattic.com/)) so that a spam check can be performed.

* * *

### Subscriptions

 **Data Used:** To initiate and process subscriptions, the following information is used: subscriber’s email address and the ID of the post or comment (depending on the specific subscription being processed). In the event of a new subscription being initiated, we also collect some basic server data, including all of the subscribing user’s HTTP request headers, the IP address from which the subscribing user is viewing the page, and the URI which was given in order to access the page (`REQUEST_URI` and `DOCUMENT_URI`). This server data used for the exclusive purpose of monitoring and preventing abuse and spam.

 **Activity Tracked:** [Functionality cookies](https://jetpack.com/support/cookies/#subscriptions) are set for a duration of **347 days** to remember a visitor’s blog and post subscription choices if, in fact, they have an active subscription.

### WordPress.com Stats

 **Data Used:** IP address, WordPress.com user ID (if logged in), WordPress.com username (if logged in), user agent, visiting URL, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, country code. _Important:_ The site owner does **not** have access to any of this information via this feature. For example, a site owner can see that a specific post has 285 views, but he/she cannot see which specific users/accounts viewed that post. Stats logs — containing visitor IP addresses and WordPress.com usernames (if available) — are retained by [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) for 28 days and are used for the sole purpose of powering this feature.

 **Activity Tracked:** Post and page views, outbound link clicks, referring URLs and search engine terms, and country. When this module is enabled, Jetpack also tracks performance on each page load that includes the Javascript file used for tracking stats. This is exclusively for aggregate performance tracking across Jetpack sites in order to make sure that our plugin and code is not causing performance issues. This includes the tracking of page load times and resource loading duration (image files, Javascript files, CSS files, etc.). The site owner has the ability to force this feature [to honor DNT settings of visitors](https://jetpack.com/support/wordpress-com-stats/#honoring-dnt). By default, DNT is currently not honored, but it is enabled on this site.
