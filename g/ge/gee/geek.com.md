Geek.com Privacy Statement 

Geek.com has created this privacy policy to assure our visitors that their privacy is respected. Your privacy is important to us. In this document we outline the ways that we collect information, and describe how this information is used.

**Information Automatically Logged  
**We log our users IP addresses to determine how many unique visitors we have. We also log general demographic information such as browser type and operating system of users.

**Advertisers and opting-out  
****Third Party Advertising** : We use DoubleClick and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [please click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp).

**Third Party Cookies** : In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser.

**Sale of T-shirts and other apparel  
**We link to [Copyleft.net](http://www.copyleft.net/) to sell Geek.com T-shirts. Copyleft collects contact information (email address, shipping address, phone numbers) and financial information (credit card numbers) in order to process orders. Geek.com does not have access to Copyleft customer information aside from a count of merchandise sold.

**Geek.com Survey  
**Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (email address), and demographic information (like zip code, age, occupation, income level, etc.). E-mail addresses from the surveys may be used to get in touch with the visitor if we have questions about comments made (typically something like "I saw a link to you in the New York Times," or something like that, may make us ask where). They may also opt-in to any of the Geek.com newsletters through the survey. E-mail addresses are not required to complete the survey, but they are required if you want to receive newsletters or enter our monthly giveaway. 

Demographic information from the survey is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

**External Links  
**Geek.com contains links to other sites. Geek.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

**Special Relationships  
**We have a relationship with [Webbox.com](http://www.mailstartplus.com/) for our e-mail services. Information collected by Webbox / Mailstart during e-mail account signup is covered by the Webbox privacy policy. That information is available to Geek.com staff for anonymous demographic analysis and presentation to third parties as anonymous demographics. Geek.com does not sell, give away, barter or in any way provide our list of e-mail subscribers to any third party.

Geek.com also has relationships with [Necx.com](http://www.necx.com/), [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/) and others to provide goods and services to our customers through affiliate links and other similar arrangements.

Geek.com has many mechanisms for users to submit content to us, including CGI scripts and e-mail. Many of our submission forms request that you give us your name along with a news item, story, tip or question. This information may be published to the site. If you do not want your name published with this information, please let us know within your submission.

**Public Forums  
**Geek.com makes chat rooms, forums and message boards available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
