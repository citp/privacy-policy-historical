# Privacy Policy | Geek.com

Geek.com has created this privacy policy to assure our visitors that their privacy is respected. Your privacy is important to us. In this document we outline the ways that we collect information, and describe how this information is used.

**Advertisers and opting-out**  
**Third Party Advertising:** We use NetShelter and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp).

**Third Party Cookies:** In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser.

**Geek.com Survey**  
Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (e-mail address), and demographic information (like zip code, age, occupation, income level, etc.). E-mail addresses from the surveys may be used to get in touch with the visitor if we have questions about comments made (typically something like “I saw a link to you in the New York Times,” or something like that, may make us ask for more details). Visitors may also opt-in to any of the Geek.com newsletters through the survey. E-mail addresses are not required to complete the survey, but they are required if you want to receive newsletters or enter our giveaways.

Demographic information from the survey is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. We use this data to tailor our visitor’s experience at our site showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.

**External Links**  
Geek.com contains links to other sites. Geek.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

**Submission Mechanisms**  
Geek.com has many mechanisms for users to submit content to us, including CGI scripts and e-mail. Many of our submission forms request that you give us your name along with a news item, story, tip or question. This information may be published to the site. If you do not want your name published with this information, please let us know within your submission.

**Contacting Geek.com**  
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with Geek.com, you can [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/). This privacy policy is subject to change without notice, but typically updates clarify wording to provide more detail or describe our policy on new services. We take pride in our privacy policy and the business choices we’ve made to respect the privacy of our users.
