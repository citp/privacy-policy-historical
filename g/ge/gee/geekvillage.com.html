          respect your privacy. Your Email address and any other data you provide 
          us will never be released to a third party. All our Email lists and 
          Membership forms use the Opt-In model. These Emails always include a 
          procedure and instructions to remove yourself from our lists. We do 
          use "cookies" on this site. We use "cookies" to retain your user name

          Certain sections of this site log and display your IP number. This includes 
          our geek/talk Forums For Webmasters. IP numbers are not secret and have 
          been used for years. Every site you visit logs and often displays your 
          IP number. We use this procedure for your protection as well as our 
          own. It helps us protect our members from abuse, permits members of 
          our Bulletin Board to "flush" impostors and "Abusers", 
          provides us with the additional evidence to aggressively pursue "Abusers", 
          and acts as a deterrent for "Abusers". If you use a Broadband 
          connection to the Web such as Cable or DSL, you should install a firewall 
          on your system to protect it from third party abuse. We have received 
          good reports about <a href="http://www.zonelabs.com/" target="_blank">ZoneAlarm</a>, 
          <a href="http://www.networkice.com/index.html" target="_blank">BlackICE</a>, 
          and the <a href="http://www.linksys.com/" target="_blank">Linksys Router</a>. 
          Then check the integrity of your system using <a href="http://grc.com/" target="_blank">Shields

          with your wishes, please leave our site and do not return. </b></font></p>
