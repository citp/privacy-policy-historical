# Gevalia.com - Customer Service - Privacy Policy

**PRIVACY AT THE GEVALIA KAFFE WEBSITE**

This website is maintained by The Gevalia Kaffe Import Service. Here at Gevalia, we recognize that many visitors to our site are concerned about the information they provide us, and how we treat that information. So we've developed a Privacy Policy to assure you that we take seriously our responsibility to protect customer information, and to use it only in ways that are consistent with your wishes. We may update the Policy from time to time, so please check in occasionally. 

You can reach us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at: **1-800-438-2542** or [Click here](https://web.archive.org/gevalia/customerservice/feedback.aspx) to send email to us. We will be happy to answer your questions or hear your concerns. 

If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, you can contact us at:

 **OUR POLICY**

At our site, we don't collect personally-identifiable information from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. So, if you just want to browse and learn about our exceptional coffees and teas, we invite you to do so. As a casual, unregistered visitor to our site, we'll recognize your home server (e.g., that your web access is through AOL.com), but not your e-mail address or any other personal or system information. 

Of course, since we sell our coffees, teas and other products through the mail, if you want to order our products it will be necessary for you to provide personally-identifiable information. This will include your name, address, phone number and, if you place an order online, credit card information. Any information you provide is downloaded off of the web server to a secure system and is maintained there. Changes to your information online may only occur after a customer has logged in with their registered user name and password. 

**OUR CUSTOMER LIST**

When you enroll in any of the Gevalia programs or purchase items from our online catalog, we add your name to our Customer List. From time to time we share selected names and addresses from this List with other companies or services that offer fine quality food or merchandise by mail. **If you prefer not to receive mailings from these companies, please advise us by using the mail, phone or e-mail address provided above.** Please include your name and address if you are contacting us by mail or e-mail. We will ensure that your name is removed from the list we share with other organizations. 

**CONTACTS FROM US**

We also use our Customer List for our own followup contacts with you. Many of our customers look forward to being contacted by Gevalia Customer Service Representatives by phone to be kept up-to-date about new coffees and services, programs and benefits. On the other hand, we recognize that some customers prefer not to be contacted by phone, even if they do love our coffees. Please be assured that we maintain an up-to-date "Do Not Call" list for customers who have advised us of their preference in this regard. If you do not wish to be called regarding our special offers, please let us know by mail, phone or email, and we will add you to our Do Not Call list. 

We also maintain a number of e-mail mailboxes in an effort to support our online customers as effectively as we do on the phone or through the mail. We read every e-mail that we receive and do our best to respond within 48 hours, if a response is required. We save a very limited number of e-mail messages, but only until the issue is resolved. We do not record email addresses, unless you have voluntarily provided it to us in your online customer service registration. 

If you did provide us with your e-mail address, we may notify you from time to time about Gevalia products or services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive these e-mail notifications, please follow the "Opt-out" instructions included with the e-mail, [ Click Here](https://web.archive.org/gevalia/customerservice/feedback.aspx) to contact us or fill out the information in our [ unsubscribe page](https://web.archive.org/Gevalia/customerservice/email_un_subscribe.aspx). We do not trade, sell or disclose e-mail addresses with other companies. 

**COOKIES**

Like most companies, we use "cookies" (small pieces of information stored on your computer) on certain parts of our web site. The cookie allows us to track your session, particularly when you are shopping in the Gevalia catalog. This is necessary to ensure that we keep your order together while you browse through the catalog and select items for purchase. We do not use the cookie to collect any type of personal information, and the cookie doesn't extract any information from your computer. 

**SECURITY ONLINE**

Most of our forms, especially when ordering a product or using online customer service, use secure pages to insure that the information sent between your computer and our system is secure. This is especially true if we are asking you for payment information. 

We use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption method on all secure submissions. This method is generally accepted to insure that the transmission of personal information, such as account numbers and credit card information is secure. The most common browsers, Netscape and Internet Explorer, make it very obvious when information is being passed in a secure manner by showing either a completed key or a closed lock on the screen.
