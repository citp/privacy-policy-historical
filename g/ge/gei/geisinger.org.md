Privacy Statement

Geisinger.org Website Privacy Statement  
The success of the Geisinger Health System in achieving its mission is critically dependent on maintaining the trust of our patients and all those with whom we interact. This trust, in turn, is built on honoring our commitment to respect your privacy. Geisinger Health System has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: [www.geisinger.org](https://web.archive.org/index_safety2.html).

Our commitment to you  
We are committed to protecting your personal privacy. We will not disclose your personal information or identify you to unaffiliated third parties.

Security  
This web site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Firewalls are in place to prevent unauthorized access to our systems. A firewall controls traffic between the Internet and our internal network and protects your information stored within our systems from outsiders. Systems are monitored for suspicious activity to prevent any breaches in security. Any data provided by you sits behind this firewall.

Geisinger also offers a secure socket layers (SSL) security protocol for certain data transmissions when sensitive data is being transmitted over the Internet. SSL is a standard industry tool used to provide data encryption and protects the personal information transmitted to and from a user's computer and Geisinger. This allows for safe transmission of personal and financial information over the Internet. Geisinger also uses digital certificate authentication to ensure secure transactions. To learn more about SSL, including how to determine if your data is being transmitted securely, see our [Security FAQ](https://web.archive.org/ssl/securityfaq.html).

We collect and use information in the following way:  
You are not required to submit any personal information to use the unsecured areas of the [www.geisinger.org](https://web.archive.org/index_safety2.html) web site.

Our site uses web-based forms that allow customers to communicate and conduct business with us. Examples include request for appointment, registration for classes, request for information and services, and online resume submission for job postings. Data collected will vary based on the business need. Information such as email address, mailing address, account or credit card information is collected when needed to respond to a specific user inquiry, e.g., to mail requested health materials. Your e-mail address is used to contact you when needed in the normal course of business, such as an appointment reminder. Individual data collected is used to assist us in providing healthcare service and to help us design and improve products and services.

Geisinger uses a registration/login process for access to secured, private areas of our web site, such as MyChart. Individual access to this information is password protected. You are the only one who has access to your password. You can change your password at anytime. You should always log out and close your browser when you�re done with your session to ensure that others cannot access your personal information.

We gather technical information such as your personal computer's IP (Internet Protocol) address or browser type to help diagnose problems with our server, derive site usage statistics, and to administer our web site. You will never be personally identified. Traffic between Geisinger and the Internet will at times be recorded for analysis (technical and physical). [Geisinger's Notice of Privacy Practices](https://web.archive.org/npp.html) would apply to this recorded information.

Geisinger utilizes cookies in conjunction with certain applications, for example with our web security application to allow you to easily move through secured pages once you have logged on. At times we may use cookies to know that you have accessed an online course or to administer certain surveys, for example, to allow a user to reply to a survey only once.
