This Privacy Policy will not govern information collected by any third party, including through any third-party application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from our Services. 

**What Information We Collect:**

To provide our users with goods and services, we may, from time to time, request that you provide us with personal information. We may ask you for additional personal information if you want to access your assigned account(s) or request goods and/or services so we can provide you with secure account access or with the requested goods and/or services.

Additionally, to better meet your overall needs, we may share your information with our affiliates who we believe can offer complementary goods and/or services to our customers or that we believe may be of particular interest to our customers. In some instances, we may also share this information with carefully selected non-affiliated companies, such as payment processors, hotels (in the case of onPeak), tradeshow organizers, exhibitors and attendees (in the case of GES), travel services providers including third party activities and accommodations (in the case of our various U.S. travel & hospitality businesses) and collections agencies, to assist us in processing your transactions to deliver the goods and/or services you request or to obtain payment for services we provide, and some of those companies may provide transactional services or send information to you on our behalf.  If you are a resident of Canada or a European Union (EU) member country, or to the extent otherwise required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent prior to sharing your personal information with any affiliated or non-affiliated companies.  Finally, residents of Canada, EU member countries, and the State of California are entitled to additional protections with respect to onward transfer of personal information, which are set forth in the “Canadian Privacy Notice (Canadian Residents Only),” “EU-US Privacy Shield For Non-U.S. Users” and “California Privacy Notice (Canadian Residents Only)” sections, respectively, of this Privacy Policy.

**Tracking Activity On Our Web Site:  **

In order to make your visit to our Web Site as productive as possible, we track Web Site activity information, such as pages viewed, the page from which you arrive at our Web Site, the date and time of your page view(s), your browser type and version, the name of any files you request, length of visit, and other navigational or technical information, through the use of cookies, log files, text strings, browser settings, and/or other tracking technology. However, we want you to know that the tracking technology we use does not identify any personal information about you. Such technology cannot retrieve data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture any personal information about you, such as your name, address, phone number, or email address. We only know who you are if you tell us. You may, however, be asked to provide personal information such as your name, address, phone number, or email address to us when you register for online goods and/or services.

_Cookies_ : One way we track activity is by using cookies. A "cookie" is an electronic file that holds small strings of text. When you visit our Web Site, we send a cookie to your browser so that we can recognize it when you or another user of your computer return to our Web Site. We want to recognize your browser so we can make the best use of your time when visiting our Web Site.  For your security, if you are registered for online services and/or have an account with us, we cannot give you access to your account information on our Web Site unless your browser is set to accept cookies from us.

_Advertising_ : When you visit our Web Site by clicking on certain banner ads or special offers on a partner's web site, we track this information to improve navigation and so we can deliver relevant information to you when you arrive at our Web Site. We also do this because we want to determine if our ads and special offers are appealing to our users. In the course of serving our ads to you, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. In addition, we use web beacons, provided by our third-party ad server, to help manage and optimize our online advertising. These web beacons enable us to learn which ads we place on third-party sites bring users to our Web Site. They do not capture or convey any personal or sensitive information about you.

_Browser settings_ : You can adjust many browser preferences so that you are alerted when a cookie is placed in your browser, or adjust preferences to decline cookies altogether. Cookies enable you to visit our Web Site without reviewing introductory information. In addition to allowing us to recognize you, cookies also enable us to securely provide our registered users with account information.

We will maintain information about you, your assigned account, online account activity, online goods and/or services requested and your usage of our Web Site to help us administer your online account needs and to continually improve your online experience by providing you with customized and relevant information and offers.

We do not knowingly solicit data online from or market online to children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe that personal information may have been collected about such child, please see _How We Use The Information We Collect_ and _Your Opt-Out Choices_ , below.

**How We Use Your Email Address for Online Accounts:**

We recognize that email can be the preferred mode of communication for some of our Web Site users. If you provide us with your email address when registering for an online service or product or when accessing your account online, we will use it to contact you about online goods and/or services for which you have registered or about your account.

We may use your email address to send you the following types of email messages:

  * Service notifications related to your accounts(s)
  * Products or services information
  * Promotional offers or updates about our goods and/or services
  * Email newsletters related to us and our business activities



We do not share your email address with non-affiliated companies for them to market their products or services directly to you. However, we may partner with selected non-affiliated companies to offer certain products or services we believe may be of interest to you.

**Ads That Link To Our Web Site:  **

We may use third parties to place banner ads on other Web Sites and will perform tracking and reporting activities through use of ad servers. We do not provide ad servers with your personal information and ad servers do not collect your personal information.

Ad servers are subject to their own privacy policies. If you would like more information about the privacy policies of these ad servers including information on how to opt-out of their tracking methods, please click [**here**](https://www.networkadvertising.org/) to visit the Network Advertising Initiative web site.

**How We Safeguard Your Information:  **

We realize how important security is to you, so we've taken a number of steps to enhance the protection of personal or confidential information sent to, or from, us over the Internet.

First, we require that a "secure session" be established. This is done any time you supply or access personal or confidential information in one of our secure online areas. This technology creates a private conversation that only your computer and our systems can understand, helping to ensure that the transmitted information remains confidential. In addition, all of our secure sites require that your browser support TLS 1.2 or newer for communications security over internet connections.  Personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites through the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted protection.

Second, many areas of the site require the use of a user ID and password as an additional security measure that helps protect your confidential information. This allows us to verify who you are, thereby allowing you access to your account information, and preventing unauthorized access.

Third, in order to bring you the many online goods and/or services offered through our Web Sites, we work with carefully selected vendors and non-affiliated companies. If we have to share any personal information with these companies in order to provide a product or service to you, we take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure these vendors and non-affiliated companies protect this information, which may include requiring they complete questionnaires and/or taking other evaluative measures of their information and security systems, safeguards, and practices prior to selection as a business partner. These measures may also include implementing contractual provisions to ensure the security and confidentiality of your customer information. In some cases, we may also audit these companies to verify the continued security of their systems and practices.

Lastly, you should be aware that other Internet sites that you link to from our Web Site or an email from us may contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of our Privacy Policy. To ensure your privacy is protected, we recommend that you review the privacy policy of other Internet sites you visit.

When you have finished using a secure area of our Web Site, make sure you always click on the "Log Out" link where and when it appears on the top of every secure page. When you click on it, no further secure transactions can be conducted without re-entering your user ID and password. This also helps prevent unauthorized access to your account if you walk away from your computer.

You should be aware that browser software often "caches" a page as you look at it, meaning that some pages are saved in your computer's temporary memory. Therefore, you may find that clicking on your "Back" button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Caching in no way affects the security of your confidential user ID or password. If you use a computer in a public place to access your account information, simply quit/exit the browser software before leaving to minimize the possibility of anyone else viewing your confidential information.

We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

**Your Opt-Out Choices:  **

We provide users with the opportunity to opt out of receiving email communications from us at any time. If for any reason you would like to unsubscribe from our communications, please follow the instructions below:

  1. Simply click the Unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of every email you receive.
  2. Send us an email at [](mailto:info@viad.com)[optout@ges.com](mailto:optout@ges.com) with the word “Unsubscribe” in the subject line. To opt out of receiving offers or email newsletters from other companies, follow the instructions provided by those companies.



Please be advised that although the withdrawal of your consent will be respected and processed immediately, it is possible you may receive promotional material that had already been scheduled prior to receipt of your withdrawal.

**EU-US Privacy Shield For Non-U.S. Users:  **

We are a global company and have facilities and affiliated companies throughout the world. Please note that we may collect, store and process your personal information in the United States or in other countries outside of the country where you live. The United States and/or these countries may not offer the same level of privacy protection for your personal information as is offered in the country in which you live. To address privacy concerns, we comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries.  We hereby certify that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.  If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>. We will use our reasonable best efforts to maintain the security of your personal information, provide opt-in/opt-out notices where personal information is collected as required, use data in a manner consistent with its original purpose for collection, and offer mechanisms for you to assist in ensuring your personal information is accurate and reliable.  In the event that we transfer your personal information or any other data regulated by Privacy Shield to a third party, we could be liable for any damages resulting from violations of applicable law arising from such onward transfer, provided that we were responsible for the event giving rise to such damage.

You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information, and you may also limit our use or disclosure of your personal information, provided that you send us notice of any such request in an email to [info](mailto:info@viad.com)[@viad.com](mailto:privacy@viad.com) or by mail to:

The enforcement authority having jurisdiction over GES’s compliance with EU Privacy Shield is the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain limited conditions, individuals may invoke binding arbitration before the Privacy Shield Panel to be created by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission. We may be required, and therefore reserve the right, to share your personal information in response to lawful information requests from governmental authorities or as otherwise required by law, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. In instances where we disclose personal information to a third party, or if that information is to be used for a purpose different than the purpose for which it was originally collected, you may opt-out of such onward transfer of your personal information by notifying us of your decision by emailing us at [](mailto:info@viad.com)[](mailto:privacy@viad.com)[info](mailto:info@viad.com)[@viad.com](mailto:privacy@viad.com) or by writing a letter to us at:
