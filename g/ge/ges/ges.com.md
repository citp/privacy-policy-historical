In the case of onPeak LLC, your information may be shared with event organizers, hotels, and other third parties as necessary to perform our contracts with event organizers.  Certain communication and computer infrastructure services are provided by its affiliate, Global Experience Specialists, Inc.

More generally, we may share your personal information with:

  * Payment services providers as required for card payments.
  * Other third parties to meet legal, regulatory, insurance, audit, and other similar administrative needs. 



All parties we share information with are required to treat your information confidentially and show that they have appropriate data protection and security controls, and that they protect personal information consistent with the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.  Wherever it is possible and reasonable, we will disclose only the minimum information necessary to complete and process an order. 

Residents of Canada, EU member countries, and the State of California are entitled to additional protections with respect to onward transfer of personal information, which are set forth in the sections titled “Privacy Shield For Users From European Member Countries and Switzerland,” “Canadian Privacy Notice (Canadian Residents Only),” and “California Privacy Notice (California Residents Only),” respectively, below.

Finally, in the event we go through a merger, sale, bankruptcy, or other business transition, we reserve the right to transfer or assign your information that we have collected as part of any business transition. In some cases, such as bankruptcy, we may not be able to control how your personal information is used.

### INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

The nature of our business and our operations may require us on occasion to transfer personal information to our GES brand affiliates and third parties that may be located in countries outside of the United States.  Accordingly, we comply with all applicable global privacy and data protection requirements.  All cross-border transfers of your information will be in compliance with the local privacy laws of the jurisdiction from which we are transferring the data, as well as in compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.  Furthermore, we will provide appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers in accordance with our legal obligations under any applicable data protection laws.

### HOW WE SAFEGUARD YOUR INFORMATION

We employ reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect against the loss of, or unauthorized access to, the information under our control.  Steps we have taken to enhance network and information security include industry standard infrastructure security, the implementation of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology for payment transactions, digital certificates, and password protection for all web applications that contain personal information.  All our web applications that deal with your personal information require a username and password to gain access. This allows us to verify who you are, thereby allowing you access to your account information, and preventing unauthorized access. You should not divulge this username and password to anyone. Although we take measures to protect your information, we cannot guarantee that your information will always remain secure.
