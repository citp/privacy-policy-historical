# Privacy Policy at Gemnation

At Gemnation, we strive to better serve our customers. We also recognize that your privacy is important. This privacy policy outlines the types of personal information we gather when you use Gemnation's website, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it.

### Cookies

We use cookies to improve the quality of our service to you. Gemnation does this by storing your "Watch List" choices and your "Shopping Cart" in cookies. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, the above mentioned Gemnation features will not function properly without cookies. 

Gemnation and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our website and to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our site. 

### Google Analytics

We use a tool called "Google Analytics" to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site.

We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. We may you use data from Google's Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests) with Google Analytics. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html). You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.

In addition to the above we at times use the following Google services: Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Third-party vendors, including Google, may show you ads on sites across the Internet.
