# Privacy policy :: Gemius SA

_Last update: 19.10.2011_  


Gemius is an international research agency, the leader and forerunner in the field of research of the internet and on the internet in Europe and in the Middle East.  


Originating in Poland, Gemius has expanded across the EMEA region and is now currently operating on thirty markets.   


##  **We Respect Your Privacy**

We respect the European Union and Polish Directives and Laws regarding personal data protection.  


We have appointed a Data Protection Officer at Gemius, who supervises the compliance of the company’s actions with environmental laws and the principles described in this privacy policy.  


We are able to gather research data in various ways and are aware of and dedicated to protection of the privacy of internet users visiting websites monitored by us.   


We provide various web-analytics and online measurement services that help our clients to understand how people use and interact with the internet. We do this by gathering research data on the traffic and users on websites administrated by our clients (and related to their advertising campaigns). As an ethical market research agency, Gemius adheres to ICC/ESOMAR international code on market and social research ([www.esomar.org](https://gemius.com/www.esomar.org)). **

## **What information do we collect about internet users?**

We gather statistical information on behavior of internet users. The information in question may include:  
•    The number of visitors to websites of our Clients  
•    Pages which are visited by the users  
•    The durations of visits or video views  
•    Details about the browsers the visitors use  
•    The site the user was visited before he/she accessed our clients’ site  
•    The total audience exposed to an ad campaign and the demographic composition of that audience  
•    Advertising click-through metrics and advertising effectiveness metrics  
•    Technical data about the user's computer, but this only includes: operating system, browser type, screen resolution and geographic location on the basis of anonymized IP address.

In order to raise standards of ensuring the protection of internet users’ privacy Gemius has decided to introduce safeguards that prevent the identification of the full IP addresses. Therefore, the lowest bits of the IP numbers are cleared.

We also display surveys to internet users of our clients’ websites during their visits to these sites. These surveys require additional e.g. demographic, non-personally identifiable information. Participation in surveys is always voluntary and the users can choose whether or not to provide the information requested. All demographic data submitted remain anonymous.  
We don’t collect any personal or personally-identifiable data about an internet user without  user's explicit permission. 

In some of the studies we ask to provide us with contact information, such as e-mail address. Persons who provide their e-mail addresses are contacted for research purposes only. We don’t send any marketing or advertising materials to individuals who provide their contact information. All data gathered are used solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and we guarantee that no e-mail addresses will be made available to any third parties.
