We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration purposes and to help us improve the Site. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

This policy explains how we use personal information you provide to us. 'Personal information' is information which identifies you or another person, or is capable of doing so.

**1.2 Password and Confidentiality**

If you are provided with a user identification code, password or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures for a registration-only section of the Site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and user name for the Site and you are responsible for all activities that are carried out under them. We do not have the means to check the identities of people using the Site and we will not be liable where your password or user name is used by someone else.

You agree to Contact Us immediately of any unauthorised use of your password or user name of which you become aware. We have the right to disable any user identification code or password, whether chosen by you or allocated by us, at any time, if in our opinion, you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these terms or the [Terms and Conditions ](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions/ "Terms and Conditions")of use of the Site.

**1.3 How we use the Information**

We use the Information held about you in the following ways:

  * To register your application
  * To ensure that the Site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer
  * To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, based on information we collect from cookies or where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes
  * To send you relevant news if you have signed up to receive it
  * To occasionally carry out surveys to ensure that we are providing you with what you are interested in

**1.4 Will we share your information with anyone else?**

Yes if…

You specifically request this, such as when you submit information to enquire about jobs or submit a job application through the [GEMS Education Careers page](http://www.gemseducation.com/organisation/careers/ "Search for Careers with GEMS Education") for current or future roles

We are required to do so to comply with the law or with direction from the courts or other authorities.

We feel it is reasonably necessary to prevent illegal activity or to protect our interests – such as when someone has breached Paragraph ‎2 (Use of this Site and User Code of Conduct) of these [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions/ "Terms and Conditions")

It helps our trusted third party service providers to provide and improve our service to you or to carry out surveys and user analysis to understand your needs and preferences. We will also share your information with MailChimp, who securely host emails and act as a supplier to distribute our newsletters. We require these service providers to keep your personal information safe and secure. These trusted third parties would only be permitted to use your personal information for the purposes we specify.

We won't rent or sell your details to any other organisation or individual. We may share some broader statistics and customer profiling information with third parties and other parts of GEMS Education - but we'll keep it anonymous, so you won't be identifiable from that data.

**1.5 Where we store and process the Information**

The Information we collect from you is partly stored on our servers in the UK. Your data may be transferred, stored outside the UK and the European Union, including in the United Arab Emirates and countries which do not have data privacy laws as strong as those in the European Union, and may also be processed by people operating outside the European Union who work for us or one of our suppliers. By submitting the Information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing across national borders and entities as needed to provide you with the service you have asked from us. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that the Information is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

**1.6 Information Security**

If you provide us with personal data over the Internet, you should be aware that data transmission via this medium cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we will take all reasonable efforts to protect such personal data, you acknowledge that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal data provided by these means and you provide it to us at your own risk. Once received, we have appropriate technical and organisational security measures in place to protect the data that resides on our servers. However, we do not warrant the security of our servers, nor do we warrant that the Information will be completely secure or not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet.

**1.7 How you can access your information**

You are entitled to be told by us whether we or someone else on our behalf is processing your personal information; what personal information we hold; details of the purposes for the processing of your personal information; and details of any third party with whom your personal information has been shared.

To do this we may charge a small admin fee for providing this information. And we may request proof of your identity before we disclose such information to you. That's so we can prevent unauthorised access. Just write to us at:
