# GE Money USA : Internet Privacy Policy

Effective August, 2006 

GE Money - Americas, including its financial institutions GE Money Bank and GE Capital Financial Inc. (collectively, “GEMA”) is committed to protecting any personal information that you may provide to us. In particular, we believe it is important for you to know how we treat information about you that we may receive from this Web site. This Privacy Policy currently is applicable only the GEMA's United States customers and visitors and only when they access and use this site, and may not be applicable to transactions performed and information collected in other channels than this site. 

Please read this policy carefully. 

**Information Collected**

In general, you can visit this Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. Our web servers also seek (as many Web sites do) to place a "cookie" (a small data file) on your computer's hard drive which allows the server to determine the computer when it visits again in order to track statistical information about navigation to and throughout certain areas of our site and to GEMA promotions on other sites. This cookie is not used to obtain your name or any personal data, and the information that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve site navigation and to measure the effectiveness of our promotional placements, and is not shared with anyone other than GEMA affiliates and contractors who assist GEMA in these efforts and who are bound to confidentiality. However, if you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your browser to reject them or to alert you before one is placed. 

We use a third-party technology to place our advertisements on other Web sites. This technology will install a small "cookie" file on your computer when you view our ad. These cookies will not contain any information that personally identifies you (such as your name or e-mail address) but they will contain a randomly generated number that is unique to your browser and can be recognized by a "Web beacon" (transparent GIF file) on our site if you click through to our site from one of our ads. This allows us to keep track of how many unique visitors we have to our site and from what ads they entered, so that we can measure the effectiveness of our ads and ad placements. The privacy policies of the Web sites on which we advertise, and through which the cookies are installed should inform you about the cookie, and you may of course set your browser to reject cookies. 

In addition, there are portions of this Web site where we may need to collect personally identifiable information about you (such as your address, phone number, social security number, mother's maiden name and information about transactions, checks cashed, items purchased, payments and payment method), for identification, account management, servicing and marketing purposes. We obtain information about you directly from you (such as on application forms), through your use of our products and services and from third parties (such as credit bureaus and demographic firms). 

This Web site is not intended for persons under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about children under 13 and we do not knowingly market our products or services to children under 13. 

**Use of Collected Information**
