## 2- What information do we collect?

  1. **Technical information we obtain when you use our On-Line Service**. As you may know, when you access a website or use a mobile application there is some information that is automatically recorded. Our On-Line Service is not different. These are the type of technical information we are recording: 
    1. When you visit, access or use our On-Line Service our servers automatically collect and retain information based on that usage. Website log data may contain your Internal Protocol address, the address of the webpage you visited, your browser type and settings, thE date and time of your access, how you used the On-Line Service and other web tracking features (below we are providing you with a detailed explanation on the other web tracking features we use).
    2. We may also collect information about the device (PC, MAC, mobile phone, tablet, etc.) you are using to connect to the On-Line Service. Such information may include the type of device, the operating system you are using, device settings, and unique device identifiers. The collection of this information depends on the device you are using and its settings. To learn about the information your device makes available you should check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
  2. **Information you voluntarily provide.** When you click on the link “Subscribe to Our Newsletters” we give you the option to subscribe to our Newsletters, press releases and the Review magazine. If you decide to subscribe you voluntarily provide us with certain identifying information such as your name (first and last), address, company name and e-mail address, as well as any areas of interest. 

Likewise if you decide to contact us using the “Get in touch with us” form, you voluntarily provide us with certain identifying information such as your name (first and last), your country, and e-mail address.

  3. **Web tracking features we use.**
    1. **Cookie data.** We put in place a specific [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/companyinfo/cookie-policy) that you can view from the link. The Cookie Policy will describe what is a cookie and why we use cookies. Please note, unless you choose to voluntarily identify yourself to us via our On-Line Service, cookies will not directly indentify you. As you read in the Cookie Policy you have the possibility to refuse cookies by configuring your browser to do so; if you do you may not be able to use some of the features of our On-Line Service and may not be able to access certain parts of our On-Line Service. To be more specific this is an explanation (this not an advice or recommendation of any kind) of the pros and cons of disabling cookies. 

Pros of disabling cookies 

      1. Privacy – Some cookies, called tracking cookies, allow third-party websites or websites that are affiliated to the websites you visit to track and record the websites that you’ve been to. These third parties can be advertisers or even the government, in some cases. Disabling cookies will, therefore, keep your browsing details private.
      2. Security – Although in general, cookies are not harmful, there have been some browsers that were found to allow malicious content to access the computers where cookies are stored.
      3. Secrecy.

Cons of disabling cookies 

      1. Convenience – Cookies are actually designed to remember information about forms and websites. Cookies are responsible for the auto-fill feature for forms where you input your address or email information. If you disable cookies, you would have to fill the forms up yourself.
      2. Personalization – Personalized content, such as the text “Welcome back, Eric!” on various home pages are possible through cookies. This will not work if cookies are disabled.
    2. **Web Beacons:** Another online identification mechanism is called a web beacon, also known as a pixel tag or clear GIF. A web beacon is a clear graphic image of a 1x1 pixel that is delivered through a web browser or a HTML compliant e-mail client application to an end-user’s device. We use web beacon to enable us to evaluate the usage of our On-Line Service, target campaigns, upgrade information we provide, and know whether you have visited a web page or received a message.
    3. **Analytics collection.** We use comScore’s Digital Analytix and occasionally Google Analytics to help us anonymously track and report your behavior information and standard log information to the On-Line Service. This information helps us analyze and evaluate how the On-Line Service is used as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our On-Line Service. Note that no personally identifying data (meaning data that permit to directly identify you as a unique person) is included in this type of reporting. Google Analytics and comScore may have access to your information only for the purposes of performing these tasks on behalf of Gemalto and under obligation similar to those in this privacy policy.
