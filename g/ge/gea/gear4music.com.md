## 1\. What Information We Collect from You

** Our primary goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and personalised experience while using our website. This allows us to provide services and features to meet and exceed your needs and to customise our service to make your experience easier and quicker. 

To fully use our website and make purchases, you will need to register as a customer, where you will be required to provide us with your contact information and some other information required to process any orders you place with us. We automatically track certain information about you based upon your behaviour on our site. We use this information to do internal research on the interests and behaviour of our users to better understand and serve them. 

We use a web analytics tool to analyse site usage, how our users arrive at our site, what they do on the site, what browser they are using and on what operating system etc. However, this analytics data, collected via a JavaScript tag in the pages of our site, is not tied to personally identifiable information. 

When you access our Websites via any means or make a purchase through the Website, we may collect, store and use certain of your personal information in line with this policy. To register or make a purchase on the Websites, we ask for your:  
\- name  
\- email address  
\- postal address  
\- phone contact details

When you make a purchase, our payment service providers will also collect and process your credit card or other payment details. If you contact us, we may also keep a record of that correspondence.

We may also collect data relating to your visits to the Websites that cannot identify you but records your use of our Websites including, for example, details of how long you have used the Website and Content for.

In line with current cookie regulations, we may also collect your computer’s IP address in order to help us tailor the service to your location.

Finally, we may receive information about you from third parties (such as credit reference agencies) who are legally entitled to disclose that information.

## 2\. Where, How and for How Long we store your Personal Data

** The information that we collect from you (including any Personal Data) may be transferred to, and stored at, various destinations. This will not include destinations outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may be processed by staff operating at various locations outside the EEA who work for us, or for one of our website development, website penetration testing (also known as “ethical hacking”), hosting, connectivity or telecommunications service providers. By providing us with your information (including Personal Data), you agree to this transfer, storing and processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not always completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your information before transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

We only use information you provide to process orders you may place at a Gear4music web site. We will keep these information as long as it is necessary under your warranty agreement, under EU and national consumer rights regulation or until relevant storage requirements from financial and tax authorities expire. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

If you gave us your consent for inform you about our exclusive offers and discounts, we will store your details until you ask us to opt out from our direct marketing or until you exercise your right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Data in any other form.

**

## 3\. How we Use the Information that we Collect from You

** We use the information collected from you to process your order. By submitting an order your personal details will be shared with the sales, customer service and warehouse fulfilment teams at Gear4music. We also need to share your data with the relevant third-party courier companies to deliver the order to your choose delivery address. 

Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information from you only  
\- where we have your consent to do so,  
\- where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or  
\- where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights.

In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you. If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences if you do not provide your information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

We may also use your anonymised data to analyse customer activity, trends, and look at improving the customer experience and processes moving forward.

 **Our exclusive offers and discounts by email (direct marketing)**  
When you register as a new customer on the Gear4music website you have the opportunity to sign up for exclusive offers and discounts by email. By ticking the ‘accept’ box, you give us your consent to send to your registered email address our regular sales newsletter and special offers, discounts and competitions. You can always opt-out later by either: logging into your account and changing your communication preferences, clicking on the “unsubscribe” link on the bottom of our emails, or contacting our customer service department. Please note, the opt-out excludes essential service messages such as order confirmation and dispatch emails.

If you registered an account before we had the opt-in box at registration you instead had chance to opt-out from our marketing emails in compliance with the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003. As you bought something from us, gave us your contact details, and did not opt-out of marketing messages, we believe you have a legitimate interest in our products and services and are happy to receive marketing from us about similar products or services even though you haven’t specifically consented. Consequently, we will continue sending you emails after the new privacy and data protection regulations take effect on 25 May 2018. We will, of course, process your data in line with the processing principles under the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and of course, you can opt out at any time.

 **Our abandoned checkout reminder service by email**  
If you created an account and leave the Gear4music websites with an item in the checkout basket before completing your journey, Gear4music will email you a reminder. For this service, we work with Ve Global UK Limited (Company No. 10706696) whose registered office is at White Collar Factory, Old Street Yard, London, EC1Y 8AF. Gear4music will share with Ve Global your email address, the transaction date, transaction ID and value. Gear4music and Ve Global are, together, joint controllers with you in respect of this service. Ve Global’s respective responsibilities in this regard are set out in their Privacy Policy under: https://www.ve.com/privacy-policy

### Integration of the Trusted Shops Trustbadge

** Following an order, the Trusted Shops Trustbadge is incorporated into the Gear4music web page in order to display our Trusted Shops trustmark for customers and the eventually collected reviews, as well as the Trusted Shops product offer. In balancing the various interests, this serves to safeguard our legitimate prevailing interests in an optimised marketing of our offer. The trustbadge and the services advertised are an offer of Trusted Shops GmbH, Subbelrather Str. 15C, 50823 Köln, Germany. 

Whenever a trustbadge is called up, the web server automatically stores a so-called server log file which contains, for example, your IP address, the date and time of retrieval, the data volume transferred and the requesting provider (access data), and documents the retrieval. This access data will not be evaluated and will be automatically overwritten seven days after your visit to the page. Other personal information will only be transferred to Trusted Shops if you decide, after completing an order, to use Trusted Shops products or have already registered for their use. In this case, the contractual agreement between you and Trusted Shops applies.

## SECTION 2: PRIVACY POLICY FOR TRADE ACCOUNT& EDUCATION ACCOUNT

** Gear4music offers the opportunity for companies, institutions and educational establishments (schools, colleges or universities) to open a trade account or an education account. These institutional accounts are not personal accounts but are linked to the relevant legal entities to which they belong. We encourage individual employees of these institutions to provide as few personal details as possible, but wherever the data of a named individual is used, that data is personal and the general rules of Section 1 of this policy apply. 

For the fulfilment of our contract with the relevant institution and with the legitimate interest of data verification and an effective business relationship with the account holder, it might be necessary to share personal information held on the institutional account with other people and departments of the same institution. Even if Gear4music aims to communicate solely with any registered main contact person, it can at its discretion, and after appropriate ID verification, also deal with other members of the account-holding institution. If an individual wants to object to this data sharing, they should do so by immediately contacting Gear4music after opening an institutional account, Gear4music may change the institutional account to a personal account to protect the individual’s privacy.

Institutional account holders must always keep their contact information up to date and must inform Gear4music immediately if registered members of staff change or leave their employment.
