# GE Appliances Privacy Policy

## RECENT UPDATES

Revision for compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that will come into effect on May 25, 2018 across the EU/EEA. Additional changes will, however, likely be necessary when further relevant regulatory guidance is issued.

## INTRODUCTION

We want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through web sites operated by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, through the software applications made available by us for use on or through computers and mobile devices, through our social media pages that we control from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, as well as through HTML-formatted email messages that we send to you that link to this Privacy Policy. We may also collect personal information from you offline, such as when you visit our stores, attend one of our trade shows, place an order over the phone, or contact customer service (collectively referred to as the _" **services** "_). By using the services, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

Haier US Appliance Solutions, Inc. DBA GE Appliances is responsible for collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. Contact details can be found in the section _'How to Contact Us'_ below.

## INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

We may ask you to provide various personal information when using the services, as described below. If you use GE Appliances' WiFi Connect platform, we will collect and store data from your connected appliances and/or devices in accordance with our [Connected Data Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy_policy_connected.htm).

We may need to collect and use some of the information listed below because we are either legally required to do so or because we need it to provide the requested services to you. If you do not provide the information that we ask for, we may not be able to provide you with the requested services.

> ### PRODUCT AND ACCOUNT REGISTRATION
> 
> When you register a product or an account with GE Appliances, we ask you to provide your name, address, phone number, email address, and your product's model number, serial number and purchase date. You are required to provide this information so that we can register your product or account.

> ### CUSTOMER SERVICE
> 
> If you schedule a service call or delivery, make a consumer inquiry, or email us, we may collect your name, telephone number, and email address so we can respond to your questions and comments. You may choose to provide additional information as well, such as the model and/or serial number of your product, the date your product was purchased and/or installed, or the nature of your issue or question.

> ### GE APPLIANCES STORE/GE PARTS STORE
> 
> To provide access to members of the GE Appliances Store and GE Appliance Parts Store, we may ask you to furnish your authorization code, name, address, phone number and email address. When making a purchase, we may ask for your contact information, including your name, postal address, phone number, email address and your payment information, including your credit card number and billing information.

> ### PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES
> 
> If you choose to participate in our promotional activities, such as rebates, contests and other similar promotions, we may collect your name, email address, and your telephone number to administer your participation. We may also collect additional information, such as the model and/or serial number of your product, and the date your product was purchased and/or installed, so that we can confirm that you qualify to take part in a specific promotional activity (e.g., when a promotional activity is available only for users of certain products or services). Some of these activities have additional rules containing information about how we use and disclose your personal information.

> ### THROUGH APPLICATIONS & OTHER ONLINE ACTIVITIES
> 
> We may collect information through software applications made available or used by us (e.g., when we provide you with maintenance or repair services), or when you otherwise use our online services or platforms. We may collect information typically collected through web sites and applications, such as browser and device information, application usage data, information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies, and IP addresses. See the section titled _'Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies'_ below.

> ### QUESTIONNAIRES AND SURVEYS
> 
> We occasionally may ask visitors to our web site and consumers to complete online surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys help us serve you better and improve the usefulness of our site. In conducting these surveys, we may ask you for your name and email address. We do not keep any personal information about you in connection with your participation in a GE Appliances survey unless you specifically agree to provide that information.

> ### SEND CONTENT TO A FRIEND
> 
> You can send certain content to your friends. To do so, we ask you to provide your name and your friend's email address. We use this information to send the content to your friend.

> ### LOCATION INFORMATION
> 
> If you use any location-enabled products, you may be sending us location information. GE Appliances does not store or use this information other than to provide the service you requested. For example, a mobile product may use GPS data to find a nearby dealer and/or service provider of our products. Location-enabled features for GE Appliances websites are opt-in and you have control over your participation and can turn these services off at any time.

## OFFLINE COLLECTION

We may collect personal information from you offline, such as when you visit our stores, interact with us or our distribution networks (including dealers and their related entities), or attend one of our trade shows/events. In this case, we will collect such personal information as you choose to provide to us. For example, if you want to receive additional information on one of our products or services via postal mail, we will collect your name and address so that we can send you the requested information.

## INFORMATION FROM THIRD-PARTY SOURCES

We may receive information about you from publicly and commercially available sources, such as such as public databases, joint marketing partners, social media platforms (including from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected) and from other third parties (as permitted by law), which we may combine with other information we receive from or about you. In addition, if you elect to connect your social media account to your web site account, certain personal information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include personal information that is part of your profile or your friends' profiles.

## SENSITIVE INFORMATION

We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the services or otherwise to us.
