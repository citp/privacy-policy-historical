# GE Appliances Privacy Statement

The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes consumers' CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. 

###  Access To Specific Information And Data Portability 

##  Access To Specific Information And Data Portability 

You have the right to request that GE Appliances disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you: 

  * The categories of personal information about you we collected. 
  * The categories of sources for the personal information about you we collected. 
  * Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information. 
  * The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information. 
  * The specific pieces of personal information about you we collected (also called a data portability request). 
  * If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing: 
     – sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and 
     – disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained. 



We do not provide these access and data portability rights for B2B personal information. 

###  Deletion Request Rights 

##  Deletion Request Rights 

You have the right to request that GE Appliances delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. 

We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to: 

  1. Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you. 
  2. Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities. 
  3. Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality. 
  4. Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law. 
  5. Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.). 
  6. Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent. 
  7. Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us. 
  8. Comply with a legal obligation. 
  9. Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it. 



We do not provide these deletion rights for B2B personal information. 

###  Exercising Access, Data Portability, And Deletion Rights 

##  Exercising Access, Data Portability, And Deletion Rights 

To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either: 

  * Calling us at [1-833-524-9055](tel:8335249055) on or after January 1, 2020. 
  * Visit our web site beginning on January 1, 2020. 



Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. 

You may make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability only twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must: 

  * Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative. 
  * Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. 



We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. 

Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. 

We will use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request only to verify the requester's identity or authority to make the request. 

Instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights are described here. 

###  Response Timing And Format 

##  Response Timing And Format 

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. 

We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. 

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance. 

We do not ordinarily charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. 

###  Personal Information Sales Opt-out And Opt-in Rights 

##  Personal Information Sales Opt-out And Opt-in Rights 

If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the "right to opt-out"). We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time. 

To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us at our website beginning January 1, 2020. 

Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. 

However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by submitting a request to us [here](https://geappliances.custhelp.com/app/ask_optout). 

You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will use personal information provided in an opt-out request only to review and comply with the request.
