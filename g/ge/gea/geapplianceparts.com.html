							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								<h3>QUESTIONNAIRES AND SURVEYS</h3>

								<h3>LOCATION INFORMATION</h3>
								<p>If you use any location-enabled products, you may be sending us location information. GE Appliances does not store or use this information other than to provide the service you requested. For example, a mobile product may use GPS data to find a nearby dealer and/or service provider of our products. Location-enabled features for GE Appliances websites are opt-in and you have control over your participation and can turn these services off at any time.</p>
