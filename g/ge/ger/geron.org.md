###### PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT

This is the website of The Gerontological Society of America (GSA).

GSA respects the privacy of its members and other visitors to its website. We have established this privacy policy to insure the confidence of members and visitors of this site; and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This privacy policy may be updated from time to time in accordance with the notification requirements set forth below. 

Our postal address is:  
1220 L Street, N.W.  
Suite 901  
Washington, D.C. 20005

We can be reached via our [Contact Us](http://www.geron.org/About%20Us/Contact%20Us) form or you can reach us by telephone at 202-842-1275.

GSA will ensure all email promotional announcements contain a marketing-specific subject line, concise promotional copy, accurate reply instructions, appropriate legal disclaimers, and unsubscribe instructions. 

GSA will honor in a timely manner all "unsubscribe" requests by properly coding the database. GSA will not share, rent, or sell member email list to other parties for the purposes of promoting outside products or services or for any reason whatsoever. 

GSA makes its membership list available for rental for one-time use to other associations or companies that have products or services that we deem to be of interest to our members. Additionally, GSA will make its conference attendee list available to exhibiting companies for one-time use. If you are a GSA member or conference attendee and do not wish to have your name included in these rented lists, please contact us through our [Contact Us](http://www.geron.org/About%20Us/Contact%20Us) form with your request. 

For each visitor to our site, our Web server automatically recognizes the consumer's domain name and email address (where possible). We collect the email addresses of those who post messages to our listserv; communicate with us via email;  post to our chat areas; volunteer information during surveys and/or site registrations, and submit payment information (e.g., credit card number and billing address). Data collected is used to track the areas of our site that are most frequently visited to help us continuously improve this site. In addition, this data can help diagnose problems with our server.

GSA periodically conducts online surveys about its service and products. GSA will ask members and users for contact information, such as email address, address, phone number; and demographic information, such as age, sex, race, and ethnicity. We may use contact data from our surveys to send information about our society. 

## From Members, Conference Registrants, Purchasers of Books and Other Materials, and Services

Individuals may be asked to provide personal information in order to gain access to the members-only portion of this site or in response to other requests. Information such as name, organization, address, phone, and email may also be submitted through membership applications, conference registrations, publication orders, subscriptions, and other products and services. In addition, in order to receive certain communications from GSA, such individuals may be asked to provide contact information such as their name, address, phone number, and email address so that they can become members of a communication or electronic publication distribution list. 

Additionally, for some emails sent in HTML format we will collect specific information regarding what the recipient does with that email. For those emails, GSA will monitor whether a recipient subsequently clicks through to links provided in the message. Other information collected through this tracking feature includes: email address of a user, the date and time of the user's "click," a message number, name of the list from which the message was sent, tracking URL number, and destination page. GSA only uses this information to enhance its products and distribution of those products to its members. This information is not sold or distributed in any other manner. 

## From General Users

GSA does not collect any personal information from users browsing its site. Only aggregate data -- such as the number of hits per page -- are collected. Aggregate data are only used for internal and marketing purposes and do not provide any personally identifying information.  We also collect information relating to your IP address, which only provides information on a particular computer, and not an individual at that computer. 

Cookies are files that contain information created by a web server that can be stored on a user's hard disk for use either during a particular session ("per-session" cookie) or for future use ("persistent" cookie). GSA uses cookies only to facilitate automated activity, store and track passwords, determine appropriate solicitations, and review navigation patterns. Cookies are not used to disseminate significant information about users over the Internet or to analyze any information that users have knowingly or unknowingly provided. 

Moreover, GSA may use a cookie to store a unique user ID in our system. Any such cookie will not collect personal information, cannot read data off your disk, and cannot read cookie files that were created by other websites.

You may remove yourself from a distribution list by following the procedures provided when you subscribed, following the unsubscribe directions in the email, or contacting us through our [Contact Us](http://www.geron.org/About%20Us/Contact%20Us) form.

This website has industry standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. While there is no such thing as “perfect security” on the Internet, we will take reasonable steps to insure the safety of your personal information.

This site contains links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage our members and visitors to be aware when they leave our site, and to read the privacy statement of any linked site.

Upon request, we provide site visitors with access to information that we have collected and that we maintain about them. GSA members can review and modify their profile using the [Update Member Profile Form](http://www.geron.org/Membership/Update%20Member%20Profile). All other user can request to review their personal information collected by this site, please contact our webmaster using our [Contact Us](http://www.geron.org/About%20Us/Contact%20Us) form. Please specify the information being requested; and include in the email your name, address, and telephone number. Consumers can have this information corrected by sending us email at the above address.

If you supply us with your postal address online, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events.   If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please contact our webmaster using our [Contact Us](http://www.geron.org/About%20Us/Contact%20Us) form. Please provide us with your exact name and address. We will be sure your name is removed from the list we share with other organizations 

Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers online may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such telephone calls, please let us know by sending us email at the above address.

GSA’s website contains areas and forms that require user and member registration to give us contact information (e.g., their name and email address), unique identifiers (e.g., GSA member number), financial information (e.g., account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (e.g., ZIP code, age, or special interest area). 

GSA does not disclose credit card account information provided by its members and visitors. When members and visitors choose to pay using their credit cards, GSA submits the information needed to obtain payment. Credit card transactions are maintained by a company called Authorize.net. All information sent to Authorize.net is encrypted, which will protect it against disclosure to third parties. When we receive your order, it is kept encrypted until Authorize.net is ready to process it. GSA does not retain any information concerning your credit card issuer, card number, expiration date or cardholder name, and Authorize.net does not provide GSA with access to this information. We only have access to the last four digits of your card number and the purchase amount once a transaction has been approved. Please review [Authorize.net’s privacy and security practices](http://authorize.net/company/privacy/). 

Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. Unique identifiers (such as membership number) are collected to verify the user's identity and that users qualify for various GSA-member discounts and promotions. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. All data is only used for GSA’s purposes. 

We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance (including direct and targeted marketing), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

In certain circumstances, we may share your information with trusted service providers that need access to your information to provide operational or other support services. We also may provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law or when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it.

GSA hosts two online job boards operated by JobTarget. For more information how information is used on that site, please refer to JobTarget’s [Terms and Conditions of Use](http://www.jobtarget.com/c2/tou.cfm). 

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice.  If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes to our website to notify you of these changes and we will use for these new purposes only data collected from the time of the policy change forward. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our website periodically.

Please contact our webmaster using our [Contact Us](http://www.geron.org/About%20Us/Contact%20Us) form if you feel that your privacy has been infringed upon. We will make every effort to resolve this problem.
