                section of the Website, in the case of our "Premium" edition, to unlock additional features of
                the Website (which features will change from time to time).</p>

            <p>BY ACCESSING AND/OR USING THE SOFTWARE (WHETHER THE FREE VERSION OR THE "PREMIUM" EDITION) YOU
                ARE DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THESE TERMS.</p>

            <h2 id="content">Content</h2>

</p>
<p>You may cancel your subscription at any time whereupon this

    therein or as a result of any matter affecting the Website and/or your User Account

    unless we are able to provide a fix within 24 hours you shall be entitled to cancel
    your subscription and apply for a full refund of your initial subscription.
</p>
<p>Save as specified in the above clause, all subscription payments are non-refundable. In the

    User Account and it will be your responsibility to cancel your subscription
    payments.
