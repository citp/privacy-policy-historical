1.  **Parties**. General Electric International, Inc. (“Operator” or “GEII”), is the commercial operator of these Sites, although software, hosting and other functions and content may be provided by Operator’s service providers (“Service Providers”), other companies affiliated with Operator (“Affiliates”), or merely in a business relationship with Operator (“Business Partners”). Operator’s Service Providers, Affiliates and Business Partners are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Privacy Policy. These Sites are not directed to or intended for individuals under 18 years of age. This Privacy Policy describes the type of information Operator and its Affiliates, Business Partners and Service Providers collect from visitors to these Sites, what we do with that information, and how visitors can update and control the use of information provided on these Sites. This Policy does not necessarily describe information collection policies on other sites, such as separate sites operated by our Business Partners that we do not control. If you do not agree to abide by this Privacy Policy or any future terms, please do not use these Sites or submit your information through them.

2.  **Changes in Terms**. Operator may change this Policy from time to time, with notice given to those completing a registration process (“Registered Users”).

If you do not agree to abide by these or any future provisions of the Policy, do not use the Sites and do not submit information through them.

3.  **What Type of Information Do We Collect?**

  (a) When you first visit one of our Sites we may ask that you register and provide us with information about you and your company including your name, company name, address, telephone and fax numbers, e-mail address, and other identity and contact information.

  (b) If you use our services, request quotes for products through our Sites or otherwise make use of the Sites, we may ask you to provide further information, including but not limited to technical specifications, financial information, and other business-related information. When you visit our Sites, we may collect certain routing information such as the Internet Protocol address of your originating Internet Service Provider, and information provided by “cookies” stored on your hard drive. Cookies are small data files containing a unique identifier so that we can recognize you each time you return to our Sites, and which keep track of the pages you view on websites and which services you use. This information allows us to provide more tailored and user-friendly services.

  (c) We also may collect aggregate information about the use of our Sites, including which pages are most frequently visited, how many visitors we receive daily, and how long visitors stay on each page.

4.  **How Do We Use the Information We Collect?**

  (a) The information we collect from and about you and your company may be used in the following ways, among others: to fulfill orders and requests; to provide quote information in response to requests; to process, execute and monitor orders; to notify you and third parties of the status of orders; to prepare drawings, product configurations or productions; to provide you with information about offers or products we believe you will find useful; or to notify you of updated information, changes to the Sites, or new products and services that we think might be beneficial to you or your business. We also may combine information you have provided to us in communications offline with the information you have given us online, to, among other things, provide a more customized experience for visits to the Sites.

  (b) We may use demographic and Site usage information collected from visitors to, among other purposes, improve the usefulness of our Sites and to prepare aggregate, non-identifying information used in marketing, advertising, or similar activities. From time to time, some information may be purged from our systems in our sole discretion.

5.  **With Whom Do We Share Information?**

  (a) We may provide the information we collect about you and your company, including your e-mail address or other identifying information, to our Affiliates and to third parties, including manufacturers, suppliers or others involved in the distribution chain to provide the products or services that have been requested. We may provide aggregate statistics about visitors, Site transactions or other Site activity.

  (b) We may disclose information about you or your company if we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so by law or legal process; to respond to claims; or to protect the rights, property or safety of Operator or others.

6.  **How Is Access To Your Information Controlled?**

  (a) Access to information stored on our systems, including order forms or requests for quotes submitted through the Sites, and billing information and account status information accessible through the Sites, is controlled by firewalls and other security measures.

  (b) Please keep in mind that the information disclosed by you in areas of the Sites that are accessible to other users -- for example, information you may provide to others on bulletin boards or in chat rooms that may be available on the Sites -- can be collected and used by visitors to the Sites.

7.  **Waiver of Additional Rights.**
