This Policy applies to our collection, processing and use of personal data when you use the following:

  * Any website that Geotab operates and which displays or links to this Policy (“website(s)”), including [www.geotab.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.geotab.com&sa=D&ust=1561416700185000). 
  * [MyGeotab](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.geotab.com/fleet-management-software/&sa=D&ust=1561416700186000), a web-based fleet management software platform that is available to Geotab customers after they have accepted the Geotab End User Agreement (a "Customer"). This [software](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.geotab.com/fleet-management-software/&sa=D&ust=1561416700186000) platform, together with a [vehicle device](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.geotab.com/vehicle-tracking-device/&sa=D&ust=1561416700187000) (the “Geotab Solution”) installed in a Customer vehicle, enables Customers to manage all fleet vehicle and driver information in one place and use it to make more informed decisions regarding their fleet.

The vehicle [device](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.geotab.com/vehicle-tracking-device/&sa=D&ust=1561416700189000) is installed into a vehicle’s on-board diagnostic port (also called the OBDII) that facilitates the extraction of data about the vehicle and its use. Any data that is temporarily stored on the device is encrypted. The vehicle data on a device is then transmitted to Geotab’s servers through secured wireless telecommunications networks and stored on encrypted cloud servers, in accordance with the applicable providers’ respective privacy, data handling and data usage policies. For more information, see the Geotab End User Agreement - [Third Party Wireless Terms](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/16BD7lCEfBCu7byRaoz662E7oeiFx8crvVEOJ_XeZ2iI/edit%23heading%3Dh.4d34og8&sa=D&ust=1561416700190000).

## Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data(Applicable to EEA only)

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), Geotab’s legal basis for collecting and processing the personal data we receive depends on the context in which it is sent to us. In our normal course of business, we will only collect and process personal data that has been sent to us by you or our Customer through: the Geotab website, the MyGeotab platform, the MyAdmin platform, or the Geotab Marketplace. We will process the personal data sent to us where you have provided your consent (as of May 25, 2018 based on Art. 6 of the GDPR) or where the processing of the information is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (as of May 25, 2018 based on Art. 6 of the GDPR). We may also process your personal data where we have a legal obligation to collect and process personal data and are the controller in respect of such data (as of May 25, 2018 based on Art. 6 of the GDPR), or where the processing is necessary to protect your vital interests or that of another natural person (as of May 25, 2018 based on Art. 6 of the GDPR). 

In circumstances where we rely on your consent to process the personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, this may not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent Geotab has received prior to the withdrawal of consent.

If you provide Geotab your personal data to comply with a legal requirement (e.g. Hours of Service) or to perform a contract (e.g. End User Agreement), we will make this clear to you at the relevant time. Geotab recommends that Customers, users, and resellers take steps to minimize the personal data they ask Geotab to process. 

Service Providers

Geotab may share information, including personal data, with our third party service providers that we engage for providing hosting, for maintenance of our websites, applications, backup, storage, payment processing, analytics, and other services. We do not allow our service providers with whom we share personal data to use that information for marketing or any other purpose other than in connection with the services they provide to Geotab. See Exhibit “A” below for more information.

## Complying with the Law and Law Enforcement Requests

In some circumstances, we may receive a request from public authorities to disclose personal data in response to a legally binding request to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. As applicable, we may disclose personal data to comply with subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to enforce our legal rights and defend against legal claims. In some cases, we may also share personal data if we believe that illegal or fraudulent activity is or has taken place so that we can investigate, prevent, and take appropriate action regarding such activities that may pose a potential threat to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Customer agreements, or to comply with the law. If your personal data becomes subject to a legal disclosure requirement and we are permitted to do so, we will attempt to notify you of said disclosure, if we have current contact information on file.

## Success Stories

From time to time, we may post success stories on our website or in other publicly distributed material that contains personal data. In such cases, we obtain your written consent before posting your name or other personal data with the success story. If you wish to delete or remove your success story, you can contact us at [legal@geotab.com](mailto:legal@geotab.com). 

## Geotab Community Forum

Our website provides Customers, resellers, and users access to a community forum for questions, comments, and other information. Any information that you post to such forum might be collected and used by others who access it. You may request to have your personal data removed from such forums by contacting us at [legal@geotab.com](mailto:legal@geotab.com). If we cannot remove your information, we will contact you with reasons why.

## Geotab Internal Sharing

We may share information, including your personal data, within the Geotab group of companies.

Geotab stores data about website visitors, Customers, and resellers on cloud servers located in North America, Europe, and Asia. We may also store data on cloud servers located in other countries from time to time. Geotab operates on a global scale and we may transfer and access such personal data from various parts of the world, including from other countries where Geotab has Customers and operations. Geotab stores European Customer data on servers located within the EEA and North American Customer data on servers within North America.

We may transmit some of your personal data to an international organization or a country where the data protection laws may not provide a level of protection equivalent to the laws in your jurisdiction. As required by applicable law, we will provide an adequate level of protection for your personal data using various means, including, where appropriate:

  * relying on a formal decision by the European Commission that a certain country ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data (a full list of such decisions may be accessed online here: [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm&sa=D&ust=1561416700199000)) ;

Customers may, if required, then make a request to Geotab who will act on valid requests within 30 days. We retain personal data that we store and process on behalf of Customers, resellers, and website visitors for as long as necessary to provide the Geotab Solution. Information (including personal data) will be retained and used as necessary to enable us to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, support our Customers and resellers, and to comply with and enforce our agreements.

We take the security of your personal data very seriously and follow generally accepted technological and organizational measures to safeguard such information. We do this when the information is in transit, in use, and at rest.

Data Retention

Geotab will retain your personal data for as long as needed to fulfill the purposes for which the data was provided. Geotab will delete or anonymize your personal data when we no longer have a legitimate business need for it. If it is no longer possible to delete it because, for example, it has been backed up in archives, then we will securely store the personal data and isolate it from further processing until deletion is possible.

For personal data that we process on behalf of resellers and customers users, we will retain such personal data in accordance with the terms of our agreement with them, subject to applicable laws.
