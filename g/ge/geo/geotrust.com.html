                      10 Privacy Principles</strong><br>
                      1. We collect only information
                    that is essential to providing optimal service to customers <br>
  and users. Acquired information is strictly limited to what we need to know
  in order to provide optimal service levels to our customers and to fulfill
  all legal or regulatory requirements. <br>
  2. We inform users about what data is collected and how it will be used. Our
  customers are fully informed about the general uses we make of collected information
  and we will provide additional information upon request. We do not sell, lease
  or license confidential information to outside parties. We provide access to
  confidential information only to outside parties who are directly related to
  the delivery and service of our products and services. Information retrieval
  is fully disclosed to all authorized parties.<br>
  3. Our customers choose how their self-disclosed data will be used. We provide
  GeoTrust business customers to decide how they want the information they disclose
  to be used. Opting out of information disclosure is available at any time.<br>
  4. We ensure information quality. We employ advanced technologies, well-defined
  practices, and a highly trained technical staff to ensure that self-disclosed
  data is processed properly, accurately and completely. We provide the mechanism
  for self-disclosed data to be corrected if errors or changes occur. We do not
  guarantee the accuracy of third party data we license to use in the True 
  Credentials™ corporate identity, but we do facilitate the process of resolving
  any data discrepancies. <br>
  5. We use information security safeguards. We use advanced information security
  technologies and a highly trained technical staff to protect all data assets
  entrusted to us. We have implemented well-defined data security and data access
  procedures to further ensure that data is protected from improper access, loss,
  misuse or destruction.<br>
  6. We are responsive to requests for explanation about our data use and policies.
  Our Customer Service Representatives are trained to be responsive to queries
  about our policies, practices, products and services. Customer Service Representatives
  are also trained to facilitate the process of resolving any data discrepancies
  in third party data. <br>
  7. We hold our employees responsible for our privacy principles. Each GeoTrust
  employee is personally responsible for helping to maintain public confidence
  in the company. All GeoTrust employees are provided with training in the protection
  of data privacy and security practices, which are also included in the GeoTrust
  employee handbook. <br>
  8. We provide these privacy principles to our business partners. We strongly
  encourage companies we select as our business partners to have privacy policies
  based upon accepted industry standards in the handling of self-disclosed data.
  These include companies that assist us in providing service to our customers
  or supply us with information about enterprises or individuals. During the
  business partner selection process, GeoTrust scrutinizes the accuracy and quality
  of the data candidates, as well as their information handling practices. We
  do not guarantee the accuracy of third party data we license to use in the
  True Credentials™ corporate identity, but do facilitate the process of
  resolving any data discrepancies.<br>
  9. We comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations wherever GeoTrust
  does business, based upon the prevailing jurisdictional requirements. As a
  company with a global reach, GeoTrust is committed to remaining current with
  the requirements of all local, national and international laws and regulations
  applicable to our products and services. <br>
  10. We undergo regularly scheduled audits of our privacy policies and practices
  to monitor our compliance with our stated policies.</p>

                    identity for a company consists of data, aggregated from
                    third parties, that provides a picture of the business entity.
                    This digital identity of a company is tied to its bids and
                    offers listed in an eMarketplace. When potential transaction
                    partners view the offer or bid, the company's business information
                    is also available, enabling business decision-making based
                    on real-time information. GeoTrust licenses the data used
                    and displayed in True Credentials<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> corporate
                    identity from third party data sources that are responsible
                    for the content.</p>

                  <p class="bodycopy">Most Internet
                      sites collect data about visitors through the use of "cookies".
                      Cookies are small software programs that help sites recognize
                      repeat
                    visitors by assigning a random number to each desktop for
                    anonymously tracking traffic patterns. If you have set your
                    browser to notify you before accepting a cookie, you will
                    notice that GeoTrust requests a cookie to be set on your
                    computer. Its purpose is to let us know when you use our
                    service. This cookie, by itself, only tells us that a previous
                    GeoTrust visitor has returned. It does not tell us your e-mail
                    address or who you are.</p>
                  <p class="bodycopy"><strong>What
                      type of cookies do we use?</strong> GeoTrust uses two types
                      of cookies: session and persistent cookies. Session cookies
                      are used during a unique user session and do not exist
                      after the session ends. When you perform a profile viewing
                      during a particular session, a session cookie associates
                      a unique ID to your session, allowing you to view profile
                    results until you close your web browser.</p>
                  <p class="bodycopy">Persistent cookies
                        remain on your computer's hard drive even after you close
                        your web browser.
                      A persistent cookie is used by True Credentials<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> corporate
                      identity with a user's consent as a convenience to the

                      the user screen each time a True Credentials<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> corporate

                      identity. When you accept this cookie from GeoTrust, it
                      is telling us that you wish to view the License and Usage
                      Agreement
                      one time, and it should be displayed again only if the
                      content of the License and Usage Agreement changes. This
                      use of a
                      cookie does not reveal the identity of the user, and GeoTrust
                      will not know who you are unless you voluntarily decide
                      to provide that information to us. You have the choice
                      of opting
                      out of this use of a cookie at any time by deleting the
                      cookie from your machine. You can also set your browsers
                      to notify
                      you every time you receive a cookie, giving you the chance
