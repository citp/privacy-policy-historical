<p class="small">Last Updated: October 13th, 2016</p>

<p>Welcome to the website and online services (the "Website") GeoGebra, which includes  the non-profit organization International GeoGebra Institute and GeoGebra GmbH. </p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes the information we gather from you, how we use that information, and what we do to protect it. By using the Website (whether or not you are a registered user),
    you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this policy..</p>

<p>Children, typically  students in K-12 education, are given additional and special privacy assurances, described in the section 'Our Commitment to Children's Privacy'.</p>

<p>Your use of the Website and any personal information you provide on the Website are subject to the terms
    of this Privacy Policy and GeoGebra's <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/tos" title="Terms of Service">Terms of Service</a>.
    Any capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Service.</p>


<h2>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</h2>


<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. If GeoGebra learns that personally identifiable information of children has been collected on the
    Website without parental consent, then GeoGebra will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or legal guardian and discover that
    your child has a registered account with the Website without your consent, then you may alert GeoGebra at <a class="obfuscatedEmail" href="mailto: ILF.SL2YIFYI@LYKAS42YX@" title="ILF.SL2YIFYI@LYKAS42YX@">ILF.SL2YIFYI@LYKAS42YX@</a>    and request that GeoGebra delete that child's personal information from its systems.</p>

<p>In particular, we never share the personal information of any user with third parties.</p>

<p>It's important to remember that you do not need to register or sign in to the Website in order to use the GeoGebra software and access thousands of GeoGebra materials.</p>


<h2>The Information GeoGebra Collects</h2>

<p>User-provided Information: When you register for, browse and use the Website, you may provide to GeoGebra what is generally called "personally identifiable information"
    (such as your full name, email address, postal mailing address, and/or home/mobile telephone number). You may also be able to add a picture of yourself. If you decide
    to register through or otherwise grant access to a third party social networking or integrated service that we may make available ("Integrated Service"), such as
    Microsoft, Facebook, or Google, GeoGebra may also collect any such "personally identifiable information" that you have provided to the Integrated Service from the account
    you have with the Integrated Service. You may revoke GeoGebra's access to your account on the Integrated Service at any time by updating the appropriate settings in the
    account preferences of the respective Integrated Service. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to
    us through each Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service's terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Website.
    From time to time, GeoGebra may also ask you optionally to provide other information. If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, you are giving
    GeoGebra the permission to use and store it consistent with this policy. Therefore, please understand that if you choose to register an account and sign in to the Website,
    you are not anonymous to us.</p>

<p>Information from other Users: We may make available certain features in the Website that allow other Users of the Website to provide us information that may include personally
    identifiable information that you provided when registering an account. For example, we may permit a Teacher to register a service  for you on your behalf in which the Teacher
    pre-populates certain teaching/instructional features (in GeoGebra Groups for example) with information about you<br></p>

<p>"Cookies" Information: When you visit the Website, whether or not you are a registered user, we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric
    characters - to your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on a website. GeoGebra may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie
    disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Website.
    Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. However, without cookies you will not have access
    to certain services and features on the Website.<br></p>

<p>"Automatically Collected" Information: When you use the Website, we may automatically record certain information from your browser by using different types of technology, including standard
    log files, "clear gifs" or "web beacons." This "automatically collected" information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring
    or exit pages, click stream data, operating system and the dates and times that you visit the Website. Additionally, we may record certain information regarding your use of features that
    GeoGebra may make available on the Website, such as the number of materials you have viewed.</p>

<p>Third Party Web Beacons: GeoGebra doesn't permit any third party advertising in our apps or web services.</p>

<p>Location Information: We may collect and store information about your location if you enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. You may be able to change
    the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with such information.</p>

<p>Information from Other Sources: We may also obtain information, including personally identifiable information, from third parties and sources other than the Website such as an Integrated
    Service like Facebook or Google+. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personally identifiable information that we collect through the Website, we will treat
    the combined information as personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>The Way GeoGebra Uses Information</h2>

<p>GeoGebra uses the information that you provide or that we collect in order to establish and enhance our relationship with you. GeoGebra generally uses
    the information you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Website.
    If you have given GeoGebra consent, we may use your personally identifiable information to provide you with information about GeoGebra's features,
    services and other offerings that may be of interest to you. Under certain circumstances (for example if you win a contest) we may post personally
    identifiable information which you shared with us on the Website. However, we will notify you of this possibility when collecting personally identifiable
    information or we will obtain your consent. </p>

<p>GeoGebra uses all of the information that you provide or that we collect from Users to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Users,
    to improve the way the Website works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.<br></p>

<p>GeoGebra may use "cookies" information to: (a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you
    visit the Website; (b) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (c) track your entries, submissions,
    and status in any promotions or other activities.<br></p>

<p>GeoGebra's employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate operational reason to obtain access to the personally identifiable information you
    may provide to register an account  on our Website.<br></p>

<h2>When GeoGebra Discloses Information</h2>

<p>Aggregate Information: GeoGebra discloses automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally identifiable information to interested third parties to assist
    such parties in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, and/or functionality on the Website.</p>

<p>User Postings on the Website: GeoGebra enables you to share your User Postings (like GeoGebra materials or books you created on the platform, for example) with other
    Users of the Website. GeoGebra may also permit you to share your User Postings publicly on the Website. If your User Postings are shared with other Users,
    any personally identifiable information that you choose to include in, or is associated with, such User Postings will be accessible by these Users.
    Once you make your personally identifiable information available to others in any of these ways, it may be collected and used by the recipients without restriction.
    GeoGebra enables Users to share information and resources.<br></p>

<p>Social Networks: GeoGebra will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. In particular, we will disclose personal information
    where you have elected to connect your account on our Website to a social network or other similar service (like Facebook or Google, for example), or have elected to
    have your activity on our Website published to a social network or other similar service. To control the information that you share, you should review and, if appropriate,
    modify your privacy settings on such services.<br></p>

<p>Required by Law: GeoGebra may also disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with national
    or international laws (such as copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant. In some cases, we may make such disclosures without
    first providing notice to Users.<br></p>

<p>Merger or Acquisition: In the event that GeoGebra is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or
    assign the information that we have collected from Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.<br></p>

<p>Other Purposes: GeoGebra also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability;
    protect GeoGebra from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement
    agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Website; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of GeoGebra, our Users, or others.<br></p>

<h2>Your Choices</h2>

<p>You may, of course, decline to share your personally identifiable information with GeoGebra, in which case GeoGebra will not be able to provide to you some of the features and
    functionality found on the Website. If you register as a user of the Website, you may update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time by going
    to your account settings page at http://accounts.geogebra.org/</p>

<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information.
    You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy and strength of your unique password and account information at all times.</p>

<h2>Accessing Services through Other Sites</h2>

<p>You may encounter GeoGebra provides math apps and materials services on  websites and in apps operated by other organizations or companies. Some of these websites may
    be co-branded with our name or logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us.</p>

<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party websites and third party servers if you choose to use GeoGebra services through these third parties.
    GeoGebra's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other third parties. </p>

<h2>Our Commitment to Data Security</h2>

<p>GeoGebra uses certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however,
    ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to GeoGebra, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information,
    GeoGebra makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not
    be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>

<p>If GeoGebra learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. GeoGebra may post a
    notice on the Website if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p>

<h2>International Visitors</h2>

<p>The Website is intended for visitors from all countries, given our worldwide community of users. If you choose to use the Website from countries with laws governing data
    collection and use that differ from Austrian law, then please note that you are transferring your personally identifiable information outside of those regions to be held
    on our servers in Austria and third party server service located in other countries and by providing your personally identifiable information you consent to that transfer.</p>

<h2>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to change the privacy policy at our sole discretion. GeoGebra users will be informed of any such change by us posting a new privacy policy on the Website
    and the effective date of any change of privacy policy will be clearly marked. We will not use any personally identifiable information of yours in ways that are materially different
    from the ones described in this Privacy Policy without also providing notification of such practices and obtaining consent to any such different uses. If we make material changes to
    this policy, we will notify you by email and by means of a notice on our Website.</p>
