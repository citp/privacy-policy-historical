3\. We transfer information about you if GeoEdge is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, GeoEdge will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

GeoEdge policy does not permit public distribution of such information under any circumstances, except as described above.
