Last Updated October, 2004**  


The Georgia Department of Education ("GaDOE") is committed to protecting your privacy. You can visit most pages on our site without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request, and this privacy statement explains data collection and use in those situations. This privacy statement only applies to georgiastandards.org; it does not apply to other online or offline GaDOE sites, products or services. Please read the complete GaDOE privacy statement.

Generally, this information is requested when you are registering before entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access premium site, signing up for an event or training, or when purchasing and/or registering GaDOE products. Personal information collected by GaDOE websites often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested. 

For example: If you choose a service or transaction that requires payment, such as making a purchase in the Shop area of the website, we will request personal information necessary for billing and/or shipping, such as: name, address, telephone number, and credit card number.

The GaDOE also collects certain information about your computer hardware and software.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration.
