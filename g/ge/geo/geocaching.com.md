  * We need to use your personal information to perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g. processing payments for Services, and administering the Services);
  * If it is in our legitimate interests and/or those of third parties to use your personal information. For example, it is in our legitimate interests to use your personal information to improve our website, to preserve the historical record of the game for other users, to allow our Authorized Developers access to geocache and public profile data to create websites and applications that extend the geocaching experience beyond what we are able to provide, to preserve other user’s messages, to ensure that our Services are secure, to tell you about new Services, products or offers, and to develop our business; or 
  * Sometimes we will ask for your consent to use certain types of personal information, such as by asking you to tick an online box or when you sign up to access certain geocaching related services including those provided by our Authorized Developers. In these circumstances, your consent will be our legal basis for processing your personal information for those purposes. If you have provided consent, you may withdraw it at any time. You may do this by "opting out" where we give you the opportunity to do so, by changing your profile settings, or by contacting us using the contact details below. 


* ## With whom do we share your personal information?

Except as provided below, we do not share or sell information that identifies our users personally or makes it possible for other parties to contact them directly.

We share your information as follows:

Who | Why do we share it?  
---|---  
Other users | 

When you create an account, we make your username and certain details about your membership, such as whether you are Basic or Premium, when you joined and when you last visited the site, and your finds, hides, and trackable count available for other users who may want to add you as a friend in our system or understand your experience and activity level for purposes of determining your credibility or engagement level with the game. 

If you choose to include personal information (such as your email address, photo, location, or other details) in your public profile, this may be viewed by other registered Geocaching account holders who use our Services for purposes of enhancing the community aspects of the game. 

Any information or content you post publicly will be shared with other users when you use the public features of our services; for example, when you log a geocache, post a photo in your gallery or participate in the Geocaching Forums for purposes of maintaining a historical record of game-related activity and enhancing the community-oriented nature of the game. 

If you choose to participate in a discussion forum, your IP address may be shared with forum moderators (who are also users) to help them provide appropriate controls on forum discussions.   
  
Authorized Developers | 

Publicly available profile information, geocache and trackable logs (including photos) will be accessible to Authorized Developers and users of their services unless you have opted out of sharing with Authorized Developers in Account Settings. 

If you opt out of sharing with Authorized Developers in Account Settings, the users of their services will still be able to see your geocache and trackable logs associated with a particular geocache or trackable (which will include your username and any information that identifies you that you have put into your log) but will not be able to view your profile information. 

Additional information such as your home location will be available to Authorized Developers if you use their application and consent to sharing your account information with them. 

Authorized Developers use this information to develop their own geocaching-related websites and applications to enhance your geocaching experience and the geocaching experience of other registered Geocaching account owners. 

These services are owned and operated by the Authorized Developers and not by us. Authorized Developers will have their own privacy policies in relation to personal information. For a list of our featured Authorized Developers, click [here](https://apidevelopers.geocaching.com/partner-list/). For a full list, please [contact us](https://www.geocaching.com/contact) with a request.   
  
Other partners | 

We provide location information to our map providers without identifying you specifically for the purpose of enabling map functionality.

Additionally, we may partner with other companies/organizations to provide trackable and other promotions, GeoTours, and Geocaching Adventures. If you choose to participate, the information you provide may be shared via our API or otherwise to enable your participation and to allow the sponsor to learn more about the location of participants. In some cases, with your explicit consent, partners may also use your information to contact you. Their use of your information will be covered by their privacy policy.   
  
Social media |  If you choose to log in to your account with or through a social networking service, Groundspeak and that service may share certain information about you for purposes of authenticating your login information. With your permission, we also may share information about your activities on our services with that social network’s users, such as if you choose to post your geocache log on your Facebook or Twitter account.   
Third party service providers |  From time to time, we employ other companies and individuals to perform specialized functions on our behalf, such as analytics, secure credit card processing, and email services. They may have access to personal information needed to perform these functions but will be prohibited from using it for other purposes.   
Third parties for legal reasons | 

We may share your personal information with others if the law requires us to, or if we reasonably believe it is necessary to comply with the law.

We may also share your personal information if we need to do so to protect or defend our legal rights, or those of our users.  
  
Third parties for business reasons | 

In the unlikely event that we wished to sell our business, we may need to share your personal information with a potential buyer. 

From time to time, we may also share your personal information with members of our group of companies, for example, if we were reorganizing our business.   
  
Providers of online analytics services |  We use third party tools such as Hotjar and Google Analytics to track how groups or categories of users interact with our Services. We enable Google Analytics’ User-ID feature to better understand how users interact with our Services over an extended period of time, from different devices and multiple sessions, so we can continue to improve our Services and provide the best experience for our users. User ID is an anonymous identifier that helps identify unique users across multiple devices and browsers. When you log-in to use our Services, your User ID is sent to Google.   
Our suppliers and subcontractors |  We may also share your personal information with suppliers and subcontractors to enable us to provide Services to you (for example, if you have ordered goods online, we may share your personal information with delivery companies).

  * _Right of access to your Personal Data_ (Art. 15 GDPR): You have the right to ask us for confirmation on whether we are processing your Personal Data, and access to the Personal Data and related information on that processing (e.g., the purposes of the processing, or the categories of Personal Data involved). “Personal Data” is defined in the GDPR as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person;

  * _Right to erasure_ (Art. 17 GDPR): You have the right to ask us to delete your Personal Data, as permitted by law. This right may be exercised among other things: (i) when your Personal Data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; (ii) when you withdraw consent on which processing is based on your consent and where there is no other legal ground for processing; (iii) when you object to processing which is necessary for our legitimate interests (pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or when you object to your Personal Data being used for direct marketing purposes (pursuant to Art. 21 (2) GDPR); or, (iv) when your Personal Data has been unlawfully processed.
  * _Right to restriction of processing_ (Art. 18 GDPR): You have the right to request the limiting of our processing under limited circumstances, including: when the accuracy of your Personal Data is contested; when the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your Personal Data and request the restriction of the use of your Personal Data instead; (and, when you have objected to processing which is necessary for our legitimate interests (pursuant to Art. 21 (1)) GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of Groundspeak override your grounds.

### Contacting us to exercise your rights and with any questions

If you need help or wish to exercise any of the above rights or have questions about them, please email us by clicking [here](https://www.geocaching.com/contact), or write to us at Geocaching HQ, 837 N. 34 th Street, Suite 300, Seattle, WA 98103. For specific requests to remove or change your profile information on Shop Geocaching (shop.geocaching.com), please email Shop Geocaching directly via https://shop.geocaching.com/default/contact.

We will consider all such requests and provide our response as soon as we can. Please note, however, that some personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your personal information for our legitimate interests, to protect the privacy of others, or to comply with a legal obligation. Please note that we may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity.

* ## How long do we keep your personal information?

If you want to permanently delete your account or following your explicit request for deletion of any of your personal information, we will delete your account and/or help you to delete your personal information as requested. Due to the nature of the game and the way that users interact, you will need to take all steps necessary to facilitate the deletion, including adopting or removing any geocaches you own and disabling your account. We will then complete the deletion process as soon as possible. The way our systems are structured, in some cases, it may take up to 30 days for records to be deleted or overwritten. In some circumstances (set out below) we may keep your personal information for longer. 

If you stop playing or temporarily disable your account, without taking any further steps or asking us to permanently delete your account or personal information, we will keep your information as long as needed to ensure the integrity of the game and the enjoyment of other players. As an example, if you temporarily disable your account without removing or adopting out your geocaches, we will keep your information until it is clear that your geocaches are no longer available to be found. Your geocache and trackable logs and any images associated with them will remain as part of the historic record of the geocache or trackable with which they are associated unless you delete them or explicitly request the permanent deletion of your account. If you have provided personal information or content which other users need to use in relation to the Services (for example information about a particular geocache you have logged, or placed; if you have moved or logged a particular trackable; or if you have left instructions or goals about a particular trackable) we may retain that information for as long as we need to provide the Services to our other users but we will delete the information or help you to delete the information upon your request. For more information about trackables please click [here](https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.book&id=10). 

We know that sometimes users take a break from the game and come back at a later time, which is why we don’t automatically permanently delete your account and personal information if you stop playing or temporarily disable your account. We will contact you if you have stopped playing or temporarily disabled your account to check if you would like us to permanently delete your information. Please note that once your account and personal information has been deleted we cannot get it back. If you don’t ask us to permanently delete your account and personal information, we will keep it until you want to reactivate your account and we will store it securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. 

If you have provided us with personal information for a specific purpose, we will keep your personal information for as long as we need to fulfill that purpose. For example, if you have provided address information as part of a competition entry, we will keep that information for as long as necessary to administer the competition. 

We will retain your contact details if you have an account with us or if we think you may be interested in marketing messages, offers, promotions, or new Services. You will always have the choice of opting out of receiving these messages. If you do so, we will remove you from our email marketing lists as soon as we can but within 10 business days. 

If you have posted content online in the Geocaching Forums, we will retain that content for as long as we think the topic is relevant. After this time, we may delete the post or archive it. 

Where we have obtained personal information automatically about your use of our apps or website (e.g. analytics), we will keep this information for as long as we feel it may be useful to us to improve and develop our business. We will delete it when it is no longer useful. This will normally be within 24 months of completion of the purpose for which it was originally collected. As an example, we may conduct a test for two months during which one group of users is shown our current home page and one group is shown a new version of our home page to determine which is preferable to users. Twenty-four months after completion of the two-month test, we would delete personal information associated with the test. 

* ## How do we protect your personal information?

Groundspeak has implemented many security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information. We protect your account information through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of your information you MUST keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. We also work to protect the security of your credit card information during transmission through the use of third party payment processors using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you input. However, keep in mind that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. 

* ## Transfers of your personal information outside the European economic area

If you are accessing our Services from Europe, then the Personal information which you provide to us, or which we collect about you, will in most cases be stored and processed in the U.S.

In order to ensure your personal information is protected we have signed up to the EU-US "privacy shield" framework. Please click [here](https://www.geocaching.com/account/documents/privacypolicy#privacyShield) to see our Privacy Shield Policy, which will apply to all personal information transferred to the U.S. Please click [here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome) to find our more information about the privacy shield framework.

* ## Do I have to be a certain age to use the services?

Our services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13. If we learn that personal information of someone less than 13-years-of-age has been collected through our services, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained an account then you may alert us [via email](https://www.geocaching.com/contact) and request that we delete that child's personal information.

* ## Complaints and questions

If you have any complaints or questions about how we use your personal information, you may contact us using the contact details set out above. We will then get in touch with you to see how we can help.

If you have a complaint about how we use your personal information, we would always prefer you to contact us first. However, you may also make a complaint to the data privacy regulator if you wish to do so. If you would like more information about how to contact the relevant data privacy regulator, please [contact us](https://www.geocaching.com/contact).

Groundspeak has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice; Choice; Accountability for Onward Transfer; Security; Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation; Access; and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability (“the Privacy Shield Principles”) which are the basis for the principles of this Policy. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

## Principles

### Notice

Groundspeak receives personal data about individuals in the EEA collected by Groundspeak and partners who promote geocaching and/or use geocaching to promote their products or locations in Europe. Groundspeak uses this personal data to provide services enabling individuals to participate in location-based play and customer support, information updates and purchases related to such services and in geocaching-related promotions. This data also facilitates our partners’ participation in geocaching-related marketing and promotions and enables partners to develop other geocaching services. 

### Choice

Groundspeak will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their data is to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. An individual may opt-out of such uses of their personal data by contacting us at the address given below.

Groundspeak will not use sensitive personal data for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected, or subsequently authorized by the individual, without first receiving the individual’s affirmative and explicit consent (opt-in). Groundspeak will treat as sensitive any personal data received from a third party where the third party identifies and treats it as sensitive.

### Accountability for Onward Transfer

Groundspeak may employ third parties to manage its IT infrastructure, provide credit card processing and customer support, perform analytics, and manage its email service. These entities may have access to personal information if needed to perform their functions for Groundspeak. 

Groundspeak may also disclose personal data – such as public profile information and geocache logs – to non-agent third parties by licensing its application program interface (API) to partners who use it to develop other geocaching-related services. If you wish to opt-out of transfers to such non-agent third parties, please contact us at the address given below or change your authorizations in Account Settings to stop such sharing of data.

Groundspeak may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

For data received under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, Groundspeak will obtain appropriate assurances from its agents that they will safeguard personal data consistent with this Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided by agents include the following: a contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield, its own EU-U.S Privacy Shield certification, or another European Commission adequacy finding. 

Groundspeak’s accountability for personal data that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Groundspeak remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Groundspeak proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

### Security

Groundspeak will take reasonable and appropriate precautions to protect personal data in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

### Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation

Groundspeak will use personal data only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Groundspeak will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete and current.

### Access

Upon request, Groundspeak will grant individuals reasonable access to personal data that it holds about them. Groundspeak will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete personal data that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. An individual may request access to their data, or otherwise correct, amend, or delete their personal data by contacting us at the address given below or by making changes to their Account Settings.

### Recourse, Enforcement and Liability

In compliance with the EU-U.S Privacy Shield, Groundspeak commits to resolve complaints about privacy and personal data collection or use. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Policy should first contact Groundspeak at the address given below. Groundspeak will investigate and attempt to resolve such complaints by reference to the principles contained in this Policy. 

Groundspeak has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
