# Privacy - GeoGebra

Last Updated: October 13th, 2016

Welcome to the website and online services (the "Website") GeoGebra, which includes the non-profit organization International GeoGebra Institute and GeoGebra GmbH. 

This Privacy Policy describes the information we gather from you, how we use that information, and what we do to protect it. By using the Website (whether or not you are a registered user), you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this policy..

Children, typically students in K-12 education, are given additional and special privacy assurances, described in the section 'Our Commitment to Children's Privacy'.

Your use of the Website and any personal information you provide on the Website are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and GeoGebra's [Terms of Service](https://www.geogebra.org/tos "Terms of Service"). Any capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Service.

## Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. If GeoGebra learns that personally identifiable information of children has been collected on the Website without parental consent, then GeoGebra will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or legal guardian and discover that your child has a registered account with the Website without your consent, then you may alert GeoGebra at [ILF.SL2YIFYI@LYKAS42YX@](mailto:%20ILF.SL2YIFYI@LYKAS42YX@ "ILF.SL2YIFYI@LYKAS42YX@") and request that GeoGebra delete that child's personal information from its systems.

In particular, we never share the personal information of any user with third parties.

It's important to remember that you do not need to register or sign in to the Website in order to use the GeoGebra software and access thousands of GeoGebra materials.

## The Information GeoGebra Collects

User-provided Information: When you register for, browse and use the Website, you may provide to GeoGebra what is generally called "personally identifiable information" (such as your full name, email address, postal mailing address, and/or home/mobile telephone number). You may also be able to add a picture of yourself. If you decide to register through or otherwise grant access to a third party social networking or integrated service that we may make available ("Integrated Service"), such as Microsoft, Facebook, or Google, GeoGebra may also collect any such "personally identifiable information" that you have provided to the Integrated Service from the account you have with the Integrated Service. You may revoke GeoGebra's access to your account on the Integrated Service at any time by updating the appropriate settings in the account preferences of the respective Integrated Service. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service's terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Website. From time to time, GeoGebra may also ask you optionally to provide other information. If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, you are giving GeoGebra the permission to use and store it consistent with this policy. Therefore, please understand that if you choose to register an account and sign in to the Website, you are not anonymous to us.

Information from other Users: We may make available certain features in the Website that allow other Users of the Website to provide us information that may include personally identifiable information that you provided when registering an account. For example, we may permit a Teacher to register a service for you on your behalf in which the Teacher pre-populates certain teaching/instructional features (in GeoGebra Groups for example) with information about you  


"Cookies" Information: When you visit the Website, whether or not you are a registered user, we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on a website. GeoGebra may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Website. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. However, without cookies you will not have access to certain services and features on the Website.  


"Automatically Collected" Information: When you use the Website, we may automatically record certain information from your browser by using different types of technology, including standard log files, "clear gifs" or "web beacons." This "automatically collected" information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, click stream data, operating system and the dates and times that you visit the Website. Additionally, we may record certain information regarding your use of features that GeoGebra may make available on the Website, such as the number of materials you have viewed.

Third Party Web Beacons: GeoGebra doesn't permit any third party advertising in our apps or web services.

Location Information: We may collect and store information about your location if you enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. You may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with such information.

Information from Other Sources: We may also obtain information, including personally identifiable information, from third parties and sources other than the Website such as an Integrated Service like Facebook or Google+. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personally identifiable information that we collect through the Website, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

GeoGebra may also permit you to share your User Postings publicly on the Website. If your User Postings are shared with other Users, any personally identifiable information that you choose to include in, or is associated with, such User Postings will be accessible by these Users.

To control the information that you share, you should review and, if appropriate, modify your privacy settings on such services.

In some cases, we may make such disclosures without first providing notice to Users.  


Merger or Acquisition: In the event that GeoGebra is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.

If GeoGebra learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. GeoGebra may post a notice on the Website if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
