### Geological Society of America

## Internet Privacy Policy

www.geosociety.org (the “Site”) is operated by the Geological Society of America, Inc. (“GSA,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).

This Internet Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) describes generally how GSA collects, uses, and transfers the personal information we collect through this Site. Because privacy laws vary from state to state within the United States and from country to country around the world, this Policy may be supplemented or amended by state or country-specific disclosures (“Privacy Notice(s)”), which will be provided to you at the time and on the page where you provide the personal information to which they apply.

As used in this Policy and any Privacy Notice, the term “personal information” means information that identifies you personally, alone or in combination with other information available to us. 

### Your Consent. 

By using this Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, and transfer of your personal information as described in this Policy (and any Privacy Notices that apply to you).

If you do not consent to the collection, use and transfer of your personal information as described in this Policy (and any Privacy Notices that apply to you), you may not use this Site. 

### This Privacy Policy May Change

GSA reserves the right to update or modify this Policy and any Privacy Notice, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version of the Policy or Privacy Notice on this Site. If we modify this Policy or any Privacy Notice, the modifications will only apply to the personal information we collect after we have posted the revised Policy or Privacy Notice on this Site. For your convenience, when we modify this Policy we will post a notice informing users of the change for thirty (30) days on the home page of this Site. 

This Policy was last revised on September 21, 2005 and is effective as of that date.

### Why We Collect Personal Information

Why do we collect your personal information? Because it helps us deliver superior products and services to our members and interested consumers. Specifically, we need to collect information from you for the following reasons (which is a representative, not an exhaustive, list): (i) so you can register on-line for GSA meetings and events, (ii) so you can subscribe to GSA journals, (iii) so you can apply for GSA membership, (iv) so you can submit advertisements for display in GSA publications, (v) so you can apply for internships and mentorship programs and (vi) so you can apply for grants from GSA. Also, your personal information helps us keep you posted on the latest announcements, offers, and events that you might like to hear about.

### Your Choices

We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use, and transfer your personal information. This Policy describes some of your choices. In most cases, we will ask you to indicate your choices at the time and on the page where you provide your personal information.

### What Information Is Collected on this Site and How Is It Used?

When you access and use this Site, there are three ways we may collect information about you:

##### 1\. Information You Knowingly and Voluntarily Provide

GSA collects the information you knowingly and voluntarily provide when you use the Site, for example, the information you provide to become a GSA member or register for a GSA meeting or event. Also, you may need to provide information in order to subscribe to a GSA journal or online newsletters, apply for a GSA grant, participate in one of our surveys, request information from GSA, or when you ask us a question or send us feedback. In many cases, this information will include your e-mail address and other personal information. Remember – you may always choose not to provide GSA with personal information. However, if you choose to not provide certain personal information, GSA may not be able to provide you with the product or service you desire.

GSA uses this personal information for the purposes for which you provide it. For example, GSA uses your personal information to complete your membership application and registration process or to confirm your subscription to a GSA journal. If we are permitted to do so under applicable law, we may also use the information we collect through this Site for various other business purposes such as customer service, fraud prevention, market research, improving our products and services, and to contact you and your company (if applicable) with information and offers we believe may be of interest to you. In addition, we may remove all the personal information and use the rest for historical, statistical or scientific purposes.

###### _E-Mail Addresses_

GSA collects e-mail address information from you when enter your e-mail address on this Site. GSA collects e-mail address information from you so that we may confirm and/or deliver your subscription; communicate with you regarding your order or registration; and alert you to other GSA programs and services that may be of interest to you. Often times, our "topical" programs are only advertised through e-mail. 

You may “opt out” of receiving these e-mail notices at any time. To opt out of receiving email notices from us, please send either use the GSA Change of Address form at <http://rock.geosociety.org/address_change/login.aspx>, or send an e-mail to gsaservice@geosociety.org. Please provide your name and email address so that we can identify your email address in our database and record your request. 

##### 2\. Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser

As is true of most Web sites, GSA gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information typically includes the IP address of your Internet service provider, the name of your operating system (such as Windows® or Macintosh®); and the name and version of your browser (such as Netscape® or Internet Explorer®). The information we receive depends on the settings on your web browser. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.

This type of information does not identify you personally. Unless you access this Site through an email we have sent you or have created a “user identity” by logging on during one of your visits, this information will not be linked to information that identifies you personally. We use this information to create statistics that help us improve our sites and make them more compatible with the technology used by our Internet visitors.

##### 3\. Information Collected By Placing a “Cookie” On Your Computer

GSA may obtain information about you by installing a “tag” on your computer’s hard drive. This tag is known as a “cookie.” The GSA server will remember your information/choices during a session. Most cookies expire when you close your browser. 

If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit this Site, you may be unable to use all of the functionality of the site if your browser rejects our cookies.

### Sharing and Transferring Personal Information 

GSA may share your personal information with business affiliates of GSA. When we do so, these other businesses will use your information in the same manner we do. For example, if they are permitted to do so under applicable law, they may use the information we collected through this Site for market research, to improve their products and services, and to contact you and your company with information and offers they believe may be of interest to you. In addition, they may remove all the personally identifiable information and use the rest for historical, statistical or scientific purposes.

GSA may also share your personal information with companies we hire to perform support services for us, such as web hosting or credit card processing. These third parties are required by contract to use the personal information we share with them only to perform services on our behalf and to treat your personal information as strictly confidential. 

In addition, GSA may share, lease or sell your personal information with carefully selected business partners. These companies and organizations may use the information we share to provide special opportunities and offers to you related to GSA’s mission and goals. 

In certain, limited circumstances we may share or transfer personal information to unrelated third parties. For example, we may provide personal information to a third party (i) at your request; (ii) to comply with a legal requirement or court order; (iii) to investigate a possible crime, such as identity theft; or (iv) in connection with the sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of GSA. If such an event occurs, we will take reasonable steps to protect your personal information.

While it is in our possession, your personal information will generally be stored in GSA databases or databases maintained by our service providers. Most, if not all, of these databases will stored on servers and storage devices located in the United States.
