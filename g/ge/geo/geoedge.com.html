        <p>This privacy policy only applies to GeoEdge</p>
        
        <p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that GeoEdge does not own or control, or to people that GeoEdge does not employ or manage. GeoEdge can be used to browse other sites on the Internet.

            <p>1. We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
            <p>2. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of GeoEdge's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
            <p>3. We transfer information about you if GeoEdge is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, GeoEdge will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

        <p>You can delete your GeoEdge account at any time.</p>
         
        <p><b>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</b></p>
