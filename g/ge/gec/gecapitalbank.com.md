If you choose to decline cookies, certain features of the Site may not function properly or may not remain accessible to you.

#### Cookies

Cookies are small text files that may be placed on your device when you visit the Site or when you view advertisements that we have placed on other websites. Cookies allow your browser to remember some specific information which the web server can later retrieve and use.  When you quit your browser, some cookies are stored in your computer’s memory, while some expire or disappear.

#### Tags, Pixels, Web Beacons, Clear GIFs

A web beacon, also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is typically a one-pixel, transparent image located on a webpage or in an email.  These may be used when you are served with advertisements, when you interact with advertisements outside of our online services or when you interact with our communications.  They are generally used to transmit information back to a web server.  

#### Interest-Based Advertising

Interest-based advertising refers to collecting information about your online activities over time and across different websites, devices, and other online services to deliver advertisements to users of that device based on their web-viewing behavior. We use interest-based advertising to deliver advertisements and other targeted content to you. To facilitate interest-based advertising, we partner with third-party advertising companies who also use these tracking tools to provide advertisements on the Site or other websites. These third parties may use these technologies to collect information about you when you use the Site and your other online activities. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may also use persistent identifiers to track your Internet usage across other websites and devices in their networks beyond the Site. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted content.

We, and many of the third-party advertisers that place tracking tools on the Site, are members of the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s  _Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising_.  Some of our ads that are displayed on third-party websites will feature an Ad-Choices icon inside the ad.  Clicking on the AdChoices icon inside the ad will provide you with an opportunity to opt out of interest-based advertising by the third parties that participate in the program. In addition, you can learn more about the options available to limit these third parties’ collection and use of your information by visiting our [opt-out page](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?pid=gs01&aid=gs01&type=marcusbygs) and the websites for the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://youradchoices.com/aboutus.aspx), as well as the webpages for [Facebook’s ad preferences tool](https://www.facebook.com/ads/about) and [privacy policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy).

If you choose to opt-out, a cookie will be placed on your browser or device indicating your decision. This cookie is specific to a particular device and browser, so if you use different browsers or devices, you will need to opt-out on each. In addition, because the opt-out is facilitated via cookies, if you clear your cookies you will need to opt-out again.

#### Additional Technology

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“ **Google** ”), on the Site. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Site, compile reports on the Site’s activity and provide other services related to Site activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor and any referring website. The Site does not use Google Analytics to gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s privacy policies.

### 8\. Other Important Information

You must be an individual of at least eighteen (18) years of age and reside in the United States or on a United States military base, or in a United States Territory in order to use the Site.

The laws in the United States and these countries regarding personal information may be different from the laws of your state or country.

### 9\. Other Privacy Policies or Statements

This Online Privacy Policy provides a general statement of the ways in which we protect your personal information through the Site. We may, however, in connection with other specific Products, provide you with privacy notices, disclosures, policies or terms that supplement this Online Privacy Policy, such as the [ Goldman Sachs Bank USA Privacy Notice](https://www.marcus.com/content/dam/marcus/us/en/pdfs/GLBA.pdf). Please refer to that notice for additional information about our privacy practices and your rights and choices.

### 10\. Do Not Track Signals

Your browser or device may include Do Not Track functionality. The Site is not built to respond to Do Not Track signals. That means that, even if your browser is set to “Do Not Track,” our information collection and disclosure practices (including the choices that we provide to customers) will continue to operate as described in this Online Privacy Policy. 

### 11\. Do Not Call Policy

Goldman Sachs Bank USA (“ **GS Bank** ”) does not place marketing telephone calls to numbers appearing on a state or federal do not call list (unless permitted by applicable law) or to the number of a person who has requested not to receive telemarketing calls made by or on behalf of GS Bank. If you ask not to receive telemarketing calls from us, you will be placed on our internally-maintained do not call list and will not be called during any future telemarketing campaigns. Any request to be placed on our internally-maintained do not call list will be processed within a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 30 days. GS Bank employees involved in GS Bank's telemarketing campaigns receive training on how to use our internally-maintained do not call list, and how to document, process and honor requests to be placed on our internally-maintained do not call list. It is our policy to honor a do not call request for five (5) years from the time the request is made. However, some states have do not call laws that require us to honor such a request for a longer period of time, and it is our policy to comply with those laws when applicable. Subject to applicable law, if you communicate with us by telephone, we may monitor or record the call. We reserve the right to revise this Do Not Call Policy.
