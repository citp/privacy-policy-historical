## BentoBox Privacy Policy

_Last updated: August 28, 2017_

We at BentoBox CMS, Inc. (“BentoBox,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) have created this privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of BentoBox in connection with our online services, which are made available to you through our website located at http://getbento.com/ (the “Website”), and our proprietary platform (the “Platform”) which is made available to you through our Website.

**Description of Users and Acceptance of Terms**  
This Privacy Policy applies to visitors to the Website, who view only publicly-available content (the “Visitors”), and subscribers who have signed up to access and use our Platform (the “Subscribers”).

By accessing and using the Website, Visitors are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Service. By signing up, accessing, and/or using the Platform, each Subscriber is agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the applicable Platform Subscription Agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”).

Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Service (when such term concerns Visitors), or the Subscription Agreement (when such term concerns Subscribers).

**The Information We Collect and/or Receive**  
In the course of operating the Website, the Platform, the Restaurant Website(s), and/or interacting with you, BentoBox will collect (and/or receive) the following types of information. You authorize us to collect and/or receive such information.

#### 1\. Personal Information

When you sign up to become a Subscriber, you will be required to provide us with personal information about yourself, such as your name, your business name, e-mail address and phone number. And, if you contact us via the Contact Us page, you will need to provide your name and contact information.

All information that we receive under this section is collectively called “Personal Information.”

We do not collect any Personal Information from Visitors when they use the Website, unless they provide such information voluntarily, such as by registering or sending us an e-mail or signing up for a newsletter.

#### 2\. Billing Information

In order to purchase a Subscription to our Platform, you will be required to provide certain information in addition to the Personal Information noted above. Such information may include a credit card number, expiration date, billing zipcode, activation code, and similar information (collectively, the “Billing Information”). Such Billing Information will be collected and processed by our third party payment vendor pursuant to the terms and conditions of their privacy policies and terms of use, and we do not obtain access to any Billing Information.

#### 3\. Order Information

When Restaurant Guests place an Order through the Platform, we will also collect and/or receive certain information, including but not limited to, Guest name, the products and services the Guests are seeking to purchase, and the payment information (collectively, the “Order Information”). We shall use and share the Guest Order Information with the applicable Subscriber as reasonably necessary to provide our Platform. All payment information provided by Guests will be collected and processed by our third party payment vendor pursuant to the terms and conditions of their privacy policies and terms of use, and we do not obtain access to any Billing Information.

#### 4\. Subscriber Data

In using the Platform, Subscribers grant us permission to access Subscriber Data. We use the Subscriber Data in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Subscription Agreement.

#### 5\. Other Information

In addition to the Personal Information, Subscriber Data, and Order Information, we may collect additional information (collectively, the “Other Information”). Such Other Information may include:

  1. From Your Activity. In an ongoing effort to improve the Website and the Platform, we automatically collect certain information when Visitors visit the Website, when Subscribers use the Platform, and when Restaurant Guests access and use the Restaurant Website(s). Such information includes, without limitation, IP addresses, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of the Website Visitors visit, and similar information concerning your use of the Platform.
  2. From Cookies. We collect information using “cookie” technology. Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s or mobile device’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to help us collect Other Information and to enhance your experience using the Website and the Platform. If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer or mobile device. Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, some features of the Website and the Platform may not function properly.
  3. Third-Party Analytics. We may use one or more third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics) to evaluate your use of the Website and the Platform, compile reports on activity, collect demographic data, analyze performance metrics, and collect and evaluate other information relating to the Website, the Platform and mobile and Internet usage. These third parties use cookies and other technologies to help analyze and provide us the data. By accessing and using the Website and/or the Platform, you consent to the processing of data about you by these analytics providers in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

In addition, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of any BentoBox marketing e-mail.

**How We Use and Share the Information**  
You authorize us to use the Personal Information, Subscriber Data, and the Other Information (collectively, the “Information”) to provide and improve the Website and the Platform; to solicit your feedback; and to inform you about our products and services and those of our promotional partners.

You also authorize us to use and/or share Information as described below.

  * Agents, Providers and Related Third Parties. We may engage other companies and individuals to perform certain business-related functions on our behalf. Examples may include providing technical assistance, order fulfillment, customer service, and marketing assistance. These other companies will have access to the Information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law. We may also share your Information with any of our parent companies, subsidiaries, or other companies under common control with us.
  * Aggregated Information. In an ongoing effort to better understand our Visitors, and Subscribers, we may analyze Personal Information with Other Information in anonymized and aggregate form in order to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Website and the Platform and for our own research purposes. This aggregate information does not identify you personally.
  * Business Transfers. As we develop our businesses, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, sale of assets, dissolution, or similar event, the Information may be part of the transferred assets.
  * Legal Requirements. We may disclose your Information if required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action or disclosure is necessary or appropriate to: (i) operate the Platform, (ii) comply with any legal obligation, report unlawful activity, cooperate with law enforcement, or protect against legal liability, (iii) protect and defend our rights, property, personnel, suppliers, sponsors, agents or licensors, or (iv) protect the personal safety of vendors, users of the Platform or the public.
  * Third-Party Applications. With your permission, third-party applications or services may access your Personal Information. We use standard OAuth (open authorization) to enable you to give permission to share your Personal Information with other websites and services, such as Facebook and Twitter (e.g., when you agree to a pop-up requesting you to allow another application to access your account information). We also use OAuth to allow us to share information about you that is stored by us without sharing your security credentials.



**How We Protect Your Information**  
We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Platform may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.

We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide us Personal Information without their permission.
