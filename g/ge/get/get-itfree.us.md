_Cookies_ _._  Cookies are small data files placed in your browser. Cookies transmit information such as session ID, user ID, and conversion data. This information helps website providers recognize a browser or mobile device and helps us gather information such as how many users have visited our site and which pages and advertisements have been seen and clicked on. We use first-party cookies and third-party cookies together to report ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with ad impressions related to your visit to our Site.  Such information is used to tailor your experience on our Site.

**HOW IS THE COLLECTED INFORMATION SHARED?**

We use the information that we collect for several purposes including: to provide our services, send you samples or offers that you request, contact you regarding new promotions, improve our Site, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our customer agreements.  We also use this information as described below:

_Affiliates_.  We may use the information we collect directly, indirectly, and in combination with data we share with other parties, to introduce you to informational, service, and/or product offerings of Get it Free and/or its subsidiaries, affiliated companies, partners, advertisers, select unaffiliated companies, unaffiliated list brokers, affiliate marketers, companies that want to advertise other products/services, assigns, and/or brands that are owned by, licensed by, and/or partnering with getitfree.us (collectively, "Affiliates"). We do this by transferring, licensing, and/or sharing your information with Affiliates so they may correspond with you and provide you with marketing materials and/or promotions that may be of interest to you. Affiliates may also transfer, and/or share your information with unaffiliated list brokers, affiliate marketers, and/or companies that want to advertise other products and/or services. Once a third party obtains your information, its subsequent use is controlled by the privacy policies and terms of use of the third party.

_Third Party Advertisers_. We work with several Third Party Advertisers and may share some of your information with these Third Party Advertisers to provide you with the best deals and offers available that we believe will be of interest to you. You may see any of these Third Party Advertiser’s ads or offers on the Site.  When signing up for the Site, you may be asked to complete a survey.  You may be shown a Third Party Advertisers’ offer while completing the survey.  You may choose to skip any offer shown to you or you may choose to provide your information in response to the offer.  When you respond to any offer shown, we will transfer some or all of the information that you submit during the website registration process to the Third Party Advertiser. Once a Third Party Advertiser receives the information you submit to them, their use of your information is controlled by the [privacy policy](http://www.getitfree.us/offers) of that third party. 

_Emails & Newsletters_. When submitting any information on our website you will see a disclaimer for receiving emails from Get it Free and its Affiliates.  You expressly authorize Get It Free and Affiliates to use your personal information as explained in this privacy policy, and you consent to receiving commercial email from Get It Free and Affiliates. You can expect to receive offers regarding specific products and/or services, newsletters, sweepstakes announcements, promotions, and other similar offers.

_Other Data Sharing_.  In addition, we may share information that we collect with our vendors or service providers who help us operate our business; in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company, our employees, our web site users, or others; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies. We may also transfer any data we collect in connection with a corporate change such as a merger, our acquisition by another company, or a partial or total sale of our assets (including as part of a bankruptcy proceeding).

**MOBILE POLICIES**

When you register with us or use the Site, you may provide us with your mobile telephone number for the specific purpose of being contacted via telephone calls or text (SMS) messages.  When providing us with your mobile number and checking the box to sign up for text message updates and offers, you are providing us with your consent to receive automated phone calls or text messages from or on behalf of Get it Free, some of which may be conducted via an automatic dialing system.  Further, you understand that consent is not required as a condition of purchase.

We do not charge you for receiving mobile text messages, but message and data rates may apply from your mobile carrier or service provider.  Your mobile carrier may collect data about your wireless device usage.  Any charges from your mobile carrier or data collection by your mobile carrier are governed by your mobile carrier’s policies and not by our terms.  We may collect data in connection with the text messaging service, including your name, mobile number, mobile service provider or carrier’s name, and any other information you may provide us.  This information is used to contact you and provide the services as described within.  Get it Free is not liable for any undelivered messages or delays of text messages.
