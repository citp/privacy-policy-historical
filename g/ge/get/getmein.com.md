Information collected by us for such activities can include contact information and survey questions. We use contact information to notify contest winners and survey information to develop promotions and product improvements to the GET ME IN! website.

**Automatic Logging of Session Data**

We automatically log generic information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which we call "session data", that is anonymous and not linked to any personal information. Session data consists of things such as IP address, operating system and type of browser software being used and the activities conducted by the user while on our site. An IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the site the user wishes to view. We collect session data because it helps us analyse such things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the site, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the site, how long visitors to the site are staying and how often they are visiting. It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems. Although such information does not identify any visitor personally, it is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.

**Cookies**

Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. There are many myths circulating about cookies, but you should know that cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable to do such things as run programs on your computer, plant viruses or harvest your personal information. The use of cookies is very common on the internet and GET ME IN!'s use of cookies is similar to that of such sites as Ebay, Yahoo!, BBC.com and other reputable online companies. First and foremost, you can rest assured that no personally identifiable information ("PII") about you (e.g., name, address, etc.) is gathered or stored in the cookies placed by the GET ME IN! web site and, as a result, none can be passed on to any third parties.

Our Site uses cookies to keep track of what you have purchased. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password (if you have supplied us with one) so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site, and for other purposes, such as informing you that you may have made multiple bookings for specific events on our Site. 

**Other**

From time to time we may add or enhance services available on the site. To the extent these services are provided and used by you, we will use the information you provide to facilitate the service requested. For example, if you email us with a question, we will use your email address, name, nature of the question, etc. to respond to your question. We may also store such information to assist us in making the site the better and easier to use.

**How can I opt-out of receiving your promotional emails?**

At any time, you can unsubscribe from our GET ME IN! newsletter or similar services through the provided link, accessible through the newsletter or by emailing [unsubscribe@getmein.com](mailto:unsubscribe@getmein.com).

You only receive e-mail updates from us about ticket sales in your area, special offers, new services, and other noteworthy items. We hope you will find these updates interesting and informative. Of course, if you would rather not receive them, please click on the "unsubscribe" link or follow the instructions in each e-mail message. GET ME IN! reserves the right to limit membership to those who will accept e-mails. Clients will be notified via e-mail prior to any actions taken.

**What safeguards are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of my personal information?**

All personal information you provide to GET ME IN! is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us.

**What other information should I know about my privacy?**

If you are a buyer, GET ME IN! will disclose your name, contact number and address details to sellers for order fulfilment purposes only.  
We use a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. We will disclose your name, billing address and credit card information to these credit card companies. But these companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes other than the billing for good and services. Additionally your contact details may be used by the courier as part of their address label to facilitate delivery and enable them to contact you directly in the event of any delivery issues. If you are a seller GET ME IN! may disclose your registered address _to a buyer_ for the return of _incorrectly delivered_ tickets. This will only happen if the event is within 3 days of the delivery of incorrect tickets. See section 3.6 of the Seller Agreement for further information. 

In addition to the circumstances described above, GET ME IN! may disclose client information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other government or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable including, without limitation, to protect the rights or properties of GET ME IN! or its affiliated companies or when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities. 

This policy is effective as of the publication date set out at the bottom of this page. Any material changes in the way GET ME IN! uses personal information will be described in future versions of this Privacy Statement. Of course, you may always submit concerns regarding our Privacy Statement or our privacy practices via email. GET ME IN! will attempt to respond to all reasonable concerns or inquiries within five business days of receipt.

Such companies may be located outside of the European Economic Area, including in the United States, and you consent to the transfer of your personal information and financial information to such companies for the purposes set out in this paragraph. Whenever we transfer your personal information or financial information to countries outside of the European Economic Area, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted by the UK's Data Protection Act 1998 and related legislation from time to time.

**Transfer of Personal Information In Event Of Sale Of GET ME IN or Ticketmaster Or their Assets**
