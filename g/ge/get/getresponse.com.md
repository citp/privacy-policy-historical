### 1\. To provide the Service or Platform

We process your Personal Information because it is necessary to enable you to use our Service or Platform. In other words, we need to process your Personal Information to enable you to sign up as our Customer or order our materials as our User. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to provide the Service or enable you to use the Platform. Thus, your Personal Information needs to be Processed, so we may perform the contract and provide our services (Art. 6.1(b) of the GDPR).

### 2\. For legitimate business interests

We Process your Personal Information for our legitimate business interest (Art. 6.1(f) of the GDPR): 

  * For analytical purposes. We believe we have a legitimate interest in analysing Service and Platform operations and Customer and User satisfaction. We consider processing this data beneficial to Customers and Users. Our aim is to constantly develop the Platform and to provide the Service of the highest quality of the Service.
  * To exercise legal claims. We believe we have a legitimate interest in processing your Data if it’s necessary to exercise claims concerning the use of the Service or the Platform that’s unlawful or incompatible with the Terms of Service or to defend ourselves against such claims.
  * To answer your queries. We believe we have a legitimate interest in replying to petitions and queries made through one of the available channels. We consider processing this Data beneficial for you because it allows us to help you and respond to your queries.
  * To conduct customer satisfaction surveys. We believe we have a legitimate interest in verifying if our Customers and Users are satisfied and what would help us improve the quality of the Service and the Platform.
  * To prevent fraud and abuse. We believe we have a legitimate interest in conducting necessary verification to detect and prevent potential fraud and abuse, including spam detection.

### 3\. To send you marketing communication.

This processing is based on your consent (Art. 6. sec. 1(a) of GDPR).

### 4\. For marketing purposes including creating your profile

The legal basis for processing your Personal Data are legitimate interests of GetResponse (art. 6 sec. 1 (f) GDPR). We have a legitimate interest in analysing how our Customers and Users use our Service and Platform, to improve and expand our customer base. Users of the Platform who have expressed their interest in receiving marketing communication to their email address give us their free, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent. Hence, we have inferred that they would have a reasonable expectation to receive such communication. At the same time, they expect that the communication we will send should be consistent with their interests. Personalized marketing communication allows our Customers to use our Service more effectively and benefit from our attractive offers. For profiling, we use only the Data our Customers or Users provide us with or the Data concerning their activity within the Platform or Service. We’re only interested in what you do on our Platform or when you use our Service, and not what you do on other websites. That’s why we decided that our interests are justified, legitimate, and at the same time, they don’t violate the rights or freedoms of our Users or Customers, which may override them.

## **V. Who we disclose your Personal Information to, and categories thereof.**

We use the services of third-party providers, who provide us with services related to: supporting certain features of the Service (webinars), hosting, customer support, tracking security incidents and responding to them, diagnosing and solving problems with the Service or Platform, web push notification display, analysis of marketing campaigns efficiency as well as analysis of use of the Service and Platform.

We also cooperate with service providers who don’t act on our exclusive request and who themselves determine how they process personal data, in order to carry out remarketing campaigns and statistical analysis.

We are responsible for the processing of Personal Information we receive under each Privacy Shield Framework and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. We comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of Personal Information from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
