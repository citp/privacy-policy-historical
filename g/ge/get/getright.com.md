_The current versions and builds of GetRight to download here no longer use Radiate/Aureate Media or Conducent for any of the ads._   
But older versions did, and are still in use. (If you've got an older one, [upgrade here](https://web.archive.org/web/20030207160743id_/http%3A//www.getright.com/get.html).)   
Headlight Software, Inc. has worked with third parties (Radiate/Aureate Media and Conducent) to show advertising in the GetRight software. A form was shown when using the Radiate or Conducent system so you may fill in as much or as little demographic information about yourself as you want. All information provided in this way is _optional_ and is not personally identifiable information. No other information is gathered from your computer.   
[Radiate's privacy policy.](http://www.radiate.com/privacy/)   
There have been some false rumors and concerns about Radiate/Aureate's system. [Aureate/Radiate Concerns](https://web.archive.org/web/20030207160743id_/http%3A//www.getright.com/aureate.html)
