SPM may collect and use this non-personal information to evaluate how the GROT websites are being used.

Most non-personal data is collected via cookies or other analysis technologies. The GROT website pages use anonymous cookies and other technologies for data analysis and potential personalization of the website and services offered.

These technologies may vary, but in many cases may involve a small file stored locally on the computer used to access the GROT websites, and may be used to store and collect information relating to your viewing and use of the websites. Information collected through cookies is used to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information we keep on individual users that details their preferences, their use and request history and behavioral activity, and can minimize the need for you to re-enter information.

Most cookies expire after a defined period of time, or you can delete your cookie file at any time. Most web browser software is initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your web browser software to refuse cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some parts of our Site will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences, and/or may have difficulty completing transactions.

SPM may collect your computer’s IP (Internet Protocol) address and domain name address, the identity of your Internet service or access provider, the type of web browsing software you use, your computer’s operating system, the URL of the web page from which you came to visit our Site and the language you selected for your web browsing software (collectively referred to herein as clickstream data). We use these technologies to identify our users, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the GROT websites and the services offered thereon.

SPM needs and uses your personal information to provide you with the services you request and to help us better understand your needs and interests in the future. Specifically, SPM uses your information to help you complete and process the transactions you have requested.

GROT or SPM’S other websites could merge with or be acquired by another business entity or organization. In that event SPM will make every reasonable effort to notify you in the event we share with the merging or acquiring entity some or all of your personal information. However, you are requested to continually check this Privacy Policy for any updates or changes.

## COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTIES

Some of our advertising partners may use cookies and web beacons on our site. Our advertising partners include Google Adsense. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to deliver (or “serve”) the advertisements and links that appear on GROT directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this occurs. Other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) may also be used by the third-party ad networks to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and/or to personalize the advertising content that you see. SPM has no access to or control over these cookies that are used by third-party advertisers.

To protect your privacy and security, when doing so we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as a password and user ID, before granting access to your data.

## UPON REQUEST, SPM WILL:

Permit you to opt out of further contact (excepting notification of major changes to the service), either on the original site of registration or at any time subsequently, while still allowing basic access to the site;  
Remove you and your personal information provided electronically from our database, thereby canceling your registration.

SPM has in place appropriate physical and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect.

You must protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Please sign off when you have finished using a shared computer. Your emails to us are not necessarily secure against interception, so do not include sensitive information in them. We will not ask for passwords in an email and you should assume that if you get such a request, it might be fraudulent. You must do what you reasonably can to ensure the security of your personal information.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily provide information in public areas of the GROT websites, that information can be viewed and possibly used by others. We therefore advise users not to disclose contact information, including phone number, email address, street address, or instant messenger address (within these public areas) that they do not wish to share. We are not responsible for personally identifying information you choose to submit in these public areas.
