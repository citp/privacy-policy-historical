We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them information.  From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them.

We may combine the information we collect with information available from other sources, including information received from promotional partners or other third parties.

Agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.

#### INFORMATION SHARING

We may, from time to time, share personally identifiable information with other companies affiliated with us and unrelated third parties (e.g., retailers, marketers) to enable them to provide users with opportunities to learn of products or services in which they may be interested.  You should also be aware that this means that we may transfer information to any country in the world, including the United States and other countries that may not offer the same level of data protection as the country where you reside.  Please see the “Your Choices” section below for more information on how you can express your preferences regarding our sharing of information.

We also may disclose personally identifiable information in the following instances:

#### COOKIES & WEB BEACONS

To enhance your experience with our site, many of our Web pages use “cookies.” Cookies are text files we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at our site.  However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.

We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our site.  For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Web pages (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites.  We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.

Cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files, and only the website that transferred a particular cookie to you can read, modify or delete such cookie.  You always have the option of disabling cookies using your browser preferences.  Most browsers allow you to delete existing cookies, to automatically decline cookies or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of particular cookies to your computer.  However, please be aware that some features of our Site may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies.  We do not control cookies that you may occasionally get from third-party sites.

“Web beacons” or clear .gifs are small pieces of code placed on a Web page to monitor the behavior of and collect data about the visitors viewing a Web page.  For example, Web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a Web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.  We may use Web beacons from third party Web analytics services on this Site from time to time for these and other purposes.  The service does not collect personally identifiable information that you do not voluntarily enter in this Site.

#### COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SPONSORS

We may, from time to time, offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that is sponsored by or cobranded with identified third parties, including affiliated businesses.  By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity.  We have no control over these third parties’ use of this information.  Since these third parties will use your information in accordance with their own privacy practices, you should check their websites for information regarding their privacy policies.  We will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.

We may use a reputable third party to present or serve the advertisements that you may see at our Web pages.  These third-party ad servers may use cookies, Web beacons, clear .gifs, or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements’ effectiveness.  The use of these technologies by these third-party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Policy.

We and our advertisers may use third parties to serve or present the ads that appear on our site and to conduct research about the advertisements.  For more information about third-party ad servers, please visit: www.networkadvertising.org.

#### LINKS TO OTHER SITES

Our Site may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us and whose information practices may be different than ours.  You should consult the other sites’ privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your personal information collected there.

#### OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY

We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access to, maintain security of, and correctly use the information we collect.  Personally identifiable information and account activity are also protected through the use of e-mail addresses and passwords.  In order to maintain the security of your information, you should protect the confidentiality of such information used to log into your account.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information.
