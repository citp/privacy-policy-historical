  5. **Cookies**



We use cookies to remember your preferences. For this reason, it is necessary that you enable cookies in your browser, and you hereby acknowledge that we have informed you of our use of cookies and that you consent to our use of cookies in relation to your computer system.

  6. **Third Party Websites**



Rocketbook may post links to third-party websites on its Site. These third-party websites are not screened for privacy or security issues by Rocketbook, and we are not liable for the conduct of these third-party websites.

Please be aware that this Policy, and any other policies in place, in addition to any amendments, does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any Personal Information relating to members of the Service or Site. Rocketbook bears no responsibility for the information collected or used by any advertiser or third-party website. Please review the privacy policy and terms of service for each site you visit through third party links.

  7. **Third Party Access to Your Information**



Although you are entering into an Agreement with Rocketbook to disclose your Personal Information to us, we do use third party individuals and organizations to assist us, including contractors, web hosts, and others.  
  
For our legitimate business interests, we use third party individuals and organizations to assist us, including contractors, web hosts, and others.  We shall ask and require these third parties to implement appropriate organizational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorized disclosure of personal data, and only to process personal data in accordance with our instructions and applicable laws, and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us. 

  8. **International Transfer**



Your information may be transferred to—and maintained on—computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Rocketbook transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Policy followed by your submission of such Personal Information represents your agreement to that transfer.

We also may use certain reputable third parties, some of whom may be located outside of the European Economic Area, to provide us with certain specialized services related to the Platform. These third parties will have access to certain information about you, but only where this is necessary in order for those third parties to provide their services to us. Where we transfer personal data to these third parties, we ask and require these third parties to implement appropriate organizational and technical security measures to protect against unauthorized disclosure of personal data, and only to process personal data in accordance with our instructions and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.

We are dedicated to protecting the privacy of your Personal Information when working with third parties. It is our policy to request that our third-party providers sign a written agreement confirming that they will use Personal Information or other information we share with them solely for the purpose to assist us and not for anything outside the scope of the services they are providing to us. While we may not always be successful in obtaining such an agreement for various reasons, we nevertheless attempt to facilitate access only to those third-party providers that share our respect for your privacy and adhere to privacy and security obligations in a manner consistent with our own policies and/or commercially reasonable practices; however, we cannot take responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of those third-party providers.

It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Policy. For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or systems. You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you authorize us to collect, share, store, and otherwise use your information from time to time in conjunction with various applications and solutions that enable us to better manage our communications with you and improve the Service.

  9. **Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes**



At times, it may become necessary for legal purposes, to release your information in response to a request from a government agency or a private litigant. You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is necessary to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we receive a subpoena or other order affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena or order, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. We may also proactively report you, and release your information to, third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities. You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.

  10. **Commercial and Non-Commercial Communications**
