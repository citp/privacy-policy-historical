	<h2>Mozilla Firefox <span>Privacy Policy</span></h2>
	<p class="info">Last Updated: January 20, 2010</p>
</div>

<div id="content">

<p>
This privacy policy explains how Mozilla Corporation (“Mozilla”), a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of the non-profit Mozilla Foundation, collects and uses information about users of 
the official Mozilla Firefox® web browser (“Firefox”) for computers (desktops, laptops, 
netbooks).  It does not apply to other Mozilla websites, products or services.  In particular, 
Firefox for Mobile has its own separate privacy policy at 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/legal/privacy/firefox/mobile/">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/legal/privacy/firefox/mobile/</a> 
because the features are slightly different.
</p>

<h3>Types of Information</h3>
<p>
As with most Internet web browsers, Firefox sends certain information to the websites that 
you visit.  This information falls into the following categories:
</p>

<p>
<em>“Personal Information”</em> is information that you provide to us that personally identifies you, 
such as your name, phone number, or email address. Except as described below, Mozilla 
does not collect or require end-users of Firefox to provide Personal Information.
</p>

<p>
<em>“Non-Personal Information”</em> is information that cannot be directly associated with a specific 
person or entity.  Non-Personal Information includes but is not limited to your computer’s 
configuration and the version of Firefox you use.
</p>

<p>
<em>“Potentially Personal Information”</em> is information that is Non-Personal Information in and 
of itself but that could be used in conjunction with other information to personally identify 
you.  For example, Uniform Resource Locators (“URLs”) (the addresses of web pages) or 
Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses (the addresses of computers on the Internet), which are 
Non-Personal Information in and of themselves, could be Personal Information when 
combined with Internet service provider (“ISP”) records. 
</p>

<p>
<em>“Aggregate Data”</em> is information that is recorded about users and collected into groups so 
that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user.
</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
A cookie is a small string of information that a website stores on your computer and that web 
browsers make available to that website each time you return.  Firefox stores cookies on your 
computer when requested to do so by websites.  A website uses cookies to help identify and 
track visitors, the use of the website, and visitors’ website access preferences across multiple 
requests and visits. It is possible to include Personal Information, or references to such 
information, in cookies, thereby enabling websites to track the online movements of 
particular individuals. To prevent Firefox from sending cookies to specific websites, 
configure Firefox to prompt you when a website wants to set a cookie.  To prevent Firefox 
from sending cookies to any website, configure it to disable cookies.  An 
<a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Cookies">article in our Firefox Knowledge Base</a>
gives you information about changing these preferences. 
</p>

<h3>Information Firefox Sends to Websites</h3>

<p>
Like most web browsers, Firefox sends information to the websites you visit, including Non-
Personal Information of the type that web browsers typically make available, such as the type 
of browser you are using, your language preference, the referring site.  This information may 
be logged by the websites you visit.  What information is logged and how that information is 
used depends on the policies of each of the websites you visit.
</p>

<p>
Each website determines its own privacy practices for the distribution and use of this Non-
Personal Information and Potentially Personal Information.  If you are concerned about how 
a website will use this information, check out its privacy policy.  To find out more about how 
Mozilla uses this information on its own websites, see the 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/privacy-policy.html">Mozilla Privacy Policy</a>.
</p>

<h3>Interactive Product Features</h3>

<p>
<em>Add-ons Features</em>.  One thing that makes Firefox so flexible is the ability for you to add 
various add-ons, extensions, and themes to Firefox, thereby creating a custom browser that 
fits your needs.  The following features show how Firefox 3.x provides both the ability to 
obtain additional add-ons easily and to protect against potentially harmful add-ons. 
</p>

<dl>
  <dt style="text-decoration: underline;">Get Add-ons Feature and Add-Ons Update.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Firefox 3.x offers a Get Add-ons Feature 
      and update service.  The Get Add-ons Feature creates a list of recommended add-ons 
      and extensions to try.  You access this recommended list by clicking on the “Get 
      Add-ons” tab from the Firefox Add-ons Manager. To display the recommended list, 
      Firefox sends certain information to Mozilla, including the type of computer and 
      version of Firefox you are using as well as your IP address and any cookies set bythe 
      Add-Ons webpage, but Firefox 3.x does not collect any Personal Information as part 
      of a download from the Firefox Add-Ons Manager.  Add-Ons Update collects the 
      same information.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
<em>Automated Update Service</em>.  Firefox’s automatic update feature periodically checks to see if 
an updated version of Firefox and installed add-ons are available from Mozilla.  
</p>

<dl>
  <dt style="text-decoration: underline;">Firefox.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This feature sends Non-Personal Information to Mozilla, including the 
      version of Firefox you are using, build ID and target, update channel, your operating 
      system, and your language preference. This feature also sends Potentially Personal 
      Information to Mozilla in the form of your IP address and a cookie that contains a 
      unique numeric value to distinguish individual Firefox installs.  Mozilla uses this 
      information to provide you with updated versions of Firefox and to understand the 
      usage patterns of Firefox users.  We use this information to improve our products and 
      services and to support decision making regarding feature and capacity planning. 
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Firefox 3.x does not collect or track any Personal Information or any information about the 
websites you visit, and Mozilla does not release the raw information we obtain from these 
Firefox 3.x features to the public.  We may release reports containing Aggregate Data so that 
our global community can make better product and design decisions.  To prevent Mozilla 
from obtaining this information, you can turn this feature off in Firefox’s preferences.  An 
<a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Firefox+makes+unrequested+connections#Auto_update_checking">article in our Firefox Knowledge Base</a>
gives you information about changing your preferences. 
</p>

<p>
<em>Blocklist Feature</em>.  Firefox 3.x also offers a Blocklist feature. With this feature, once a day 
Firefox does a regularly scheduled, automatic check to see if you have any harmful add-ons 
or plug-ins installed.  If so, this feature disables add-ons or plug-ins that Mozilla has 
determined contain known vulnerabilities or major user facing issues or fatal bugs (e.g., 
client crashes on startup or something causing an endless loop of unusability).  You may 
view the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/blocklist/">current list of Blocklisted items</a>.  
This feature sends Non-Personal Information to 
Mozilla, including the version of Firefox you are using, operating system version, build ID 
and target, update channel, and your language preference. This feature also sends Potentially 
Personal Information to Mozilla in the form of your IP address and a cookie. In addition, 
Mozilla also uses this feature to analyze Firefox usage patterns so we may improve our 
products and services, including planning features and capacity.  Currently there is no basic 
user interface to disable the Blocklist feature.  An 
<a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Firefox+makes+unrequested+connections#Extension_blocklist_updating">article in our Firefox Knowledge Base</a>
explains how you may disable the Blocklist feature.  Disabling the Blocklist feature is not 
recommended as it may result in using extensions know to be untrustworthy.
</p>

<p>
<em>Crash-Reporting Feature</em>.  Firefox has a crash-reporting feature that sends a report to Mozilla 
when Firefox crashes.  Mozilla uses the information in the crash reports to diagnose and 
correct the problems in Firefox that caused the crash.  Though this feature starts 
automatically after Firefox crashes, it does not send information to Mozilla until you 
explicitly authorize it to do so.  By default, this feature sends a variety of Non-Personal 
Information to Mozilla, including the stack trace (a detailed description of which parts of the 
Firefox code were active at the time of the crash) and the type of computer you are using.  
Additional information is collected by the crash reporting feature. Which crash reporting 
feature is used and what additional information collected by Firefox depends on which 
version of Firefox you’re using.  For pre-3.x versions of Firefox, please see the end of this 
privacy policy.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt style="text-decoration: underline;">Firefox 3.0 to present.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      For the current versions of Firefox, “Firefox Crash Reporter” 
      is Firefox’s crash reporting feature.  With this feature, you have the option to include 
      Personal Information (including your email address), Potentially Personal 
      Information (including your IP address and the URL of the site you were visiting 
      when Firefox crashed), and a comment.  Firefox Crash Reporter also sends a list of all 
      add-ons that you were using at the time of the crash, the time since (i) the last crash, 
      (ii) the last install, and (iii) the start-up of the program.  For Firefox 3.0.0 – 3.0.5, 
      Firefox Crash Reporter also collects Potentially Personal Information to Mozilla in 
      the form of a unique alphanumeric value to distinguish individual Firefox installs.  
      This value is not assigned to users of Firefox 3.0.6 and subsequent versions.  Mozilla 
      only makes Non-Personal Information (i.e., generic information about your computer, 
      the stack trace, and any comment given by the user) available in the public reports 
      available online at <a href="http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/">http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/</a>. 
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
To safeguard your privacy, Mozilla’s policy is to make Personal Information, such as your 
name and email address, and Potentially Personal Information, such are the URL of the site 
you last visited, only available to its employees, contractors, and selected contributors who 
signed confidentiality agreements that prohibit them from using or disclosing such 
information other than for approved Mozilla purposes.
</p>

<p>
<em>Location-Aware Feature</em>.  Beginning with Firefox 3.5, Firefox offers a 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/geolocation/">Location-Aware Feature</a>, 
parts of which may be provided by 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/legal/privacy/firefox-third-party.html">third-party service providers</a>
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><em>You Elect to Use the Location-Aware Feature.</em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This feature remains inoperative until 
      you visit a website that requests your location and you choose to opt in to the feature.  
      If you elect not to, nothing happens.  Each time you visit such a website, Firefox asks 
      you if you want it to provide the site with your current location.  Additionally, you 
      may elect to have Firefox remember your choice to allow or not allow the feature for 
      each site. Any such election is domain specific. You are able to opt out at any time of 
      having Firefox remember your choice, just like any other preference setting.  
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><em>What Information Firefox Collects.</em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      If you choose to allow it, the Firefox Location-
      Aware Feature first collects one or more of the following relevant location markers: 
      (i) location provided by a GPS device built into or attached to your computer or 
      device and/or geolocation services provided by the operating system; (ii) the wifi 
      routers closest to you; (iii) cell ids of the cell towers closest to you; (iv) the signal 
      strength of nearby wireless access points and/or cellular phone towers; and/or (v) 
      your computer or device’s IP address.  Next, it attempts to determine your location 
      using these location markers.  Any information Firefox uses, receives or sends as part 
      of this Location-Aware Feature is not received by any Mozilla servers or by Mozilla.  
      Firefox does not track or remember your location.   Firefox does remember a random 
      client identifier, the temporary ID assigned by our third party provider to process your 
      request, for two weeks.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><em>What Information Third Parties Receive &amp; Provide.</em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If necessary, Firefox sends the 
      information above, except any GPS information and/or geolocation data provided by 
      the operating system, plus your user agent information (e.g, version of Firefox you’re 
      using), along with a temporary client identifier, to its third party service provider(s) 
      capable of deriving a physical location from the information Firefox has collected 
      (e.g., convert a set of WiFi signal strengths into latitude and longitude).  This 
      information is sent over an encrypted connection. The connection between Firefox 
      and the service provider does not use any cookies. Neither the domain name nor the 
      URL of the site you’re visiting are sent to our service providers.  Our providers 
      estimate your location and return it to Firefox.  Firefox provides your location 
      information to the webpage that made the request.  For any information the webpage 
      sends back to the website, please see that website’s privacy policy. 
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><em>How Third Parties Providers Use the Information Received.</em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Our policy is to require 
      third-party providers to enter licensing agreements with Mozilla, which prohibit them 
      from releasing Personal or Potentially Personal Information to the public.  We only 
      permit our third party providers to use this information in conjunction with the 
      service(s) they are providing to us.  They are required to ensure that any information 
      collected on our behalf is anonymized and aggregated before they are permitted to 
      use such information to develop new features or products and services, or to improve 
      the overall quality of any of their products and services.  For example, this means that 
      they are required to ensure that your IP address and unique identifier of your client 
      will be stripped out before being used by any of our third party provider’s other 
      products or features.  For more information, please see our
      <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/legal/privacy/firefox-third-party.html">third-party service providers</a>
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><em>Third Party Websites.</em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Please carefully consider any website's privacy practices 
      before agreeing to share your location with that website.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Requesting Websites</em>. 
        For any information the webpage sends back to the website, please see that website’s privacy policy.
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>Location-Aware Service Providers</em>.  
        In addition, our service providers have their own privacy policy.
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>ISP and Mobile Carrier</em>.  
        All requests for your location must be sent through 
        your Internet service provider or mobile carrier network and your service 
        provider or carrier may have access to the request. For information regarding 
        your service provider's or carrier's treatment of your information, please 
        consult their privacy policies. 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

</dl>

<p>
<em>Personas Feature</em>.  Firefox’s Personas feature is a theme that lets you personalize the look of 
your browser.  
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Personal Information</strong></dt>

  <dt><em>Applying Personas.</em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      When you apply a Personas to your browser, Mozilla collects 
      your IP address, the date and time you applied the Personas design to your browser, 
      and the url you used to make the application as well as the url you were visiting 
      immediately before that (known as the “referrer” url).  
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><em>Creating a Custom Persona.</em></dt>  
  <dd>
    <p>If you are creating a Custom Persona for your own use, 
      Mozilla does not collect any Personal Information.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><em>Contributing a Design to the Personas Gallery.</em></dt>  
  <dd>
    <p>The Personas gallery is where you 
      can browse all the available designs.  If you contribute a design or image (each a 
      “Persona Design”) to the Personas gallery, Mozilla collects the following Personal 
      Information: (1) your user name and (2) your email address.  Your user name will be 
      used to attribute your Persona Design to you and will be publicly available on the 
      Personas gallery.  You do not have to provide your real name; you can use a 
      nickname or avatar.  Mozilla will not make your email address publicly available or 
      share it with any third parties other than Mozilla’s service providers.  Mozilla will use 
      your email address only to contact you regarding your design or to provide any 
      additional information that you elect or opt in to receive.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><strong>Personas’ Interactive Product Features</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      After you have selected your Personas Design, it is stored on your computer.  Once 
      per day Personas checks to see if your selected Persona Design has been updated.  
      This feature sends the same information that web browsers typically transfer with any 
      HTTP requests including user agent and your IP address. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We use this information to improve our products and services and to support decision 
      making regarding feature and capacity planning.  Mozilla is an open organization that 
      believes in sharing as much information as possible about its products, its operations, 
      and its associations. Accordingly, we may release public reports containing 
      Aggregate Data so that our global community and Personas partners may make better 
      product and design decisions.  For example, we think it is good for  users of Personas 
      to know which are the most popular Persona Designs and Personas designers to know 
      how many times their Persona Design was downloaded.  
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
<em>Report Broken Website Feature</em>.  Firefox’s Report Broken Website feature lets you notify 
Mozilla when a website you visit improperly displays or incorrectly functions.  The feature 
sends the URL of the broken website to Mozilla.  You may also choose to send your email 
address and a description of the problem.  This feature also sends a your IP address and a 
variety of Non-Personal Information to Mozilla, including but not limited to the version of 
Firefox you are using and your language preference.  Except for your email and IP address, 
Mozilla makes all of this information public.  This feature does not send information to 
Mozilla until you explicitly authorize Firefox to do so.  To prevent this public release of 
Personal and Potentially Personal Information, don’t report a website if the website’s URL 
contains your Personal and Potentially Personal Information, and don’t include Personal 
Information in your description of the problem.  To prevent the release of any information, 
don’t use this feature to report a broken website.
</p>

<p>
<em>Report Web Forgery Feature</em>.  Firefox’s Report Web Forgery feature lets you report 
suspected web forgeries to Mozilla’s third party service provider(s) for the web forgery 
protection feature when you encounter a suspected malicious “phishing” or fraudulent 
website that is impersonating a legitimate website.  This feature sends your comments about 
the suspected fraudulent website to our third-party provider(s), as well as the same 
information that the browser sends when you visit a website.  Our policy is to require each of 
our third-party providers to enter into written agreements with Mozilla that prohibit them 
from releasing Potentially Personal Information to the public.  Our policy is to only permit 
these third party providers to use this information in conjunction with the web forgery 
protection service they are providing.  In addition, we require each third-party provider to 
maintain its own privacy policy that is linked to the online form where you report a potential 
web forgery.  To prevent the third party provider from obtaining this information, don’t use 
this feature to report a web forgery.  (Also see <em>“Protection Against Suspected Forgery and 
Attack Sites Features”</em> below.) 
</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>
Mozilla is committed to protecting your personal information from unauthorized access, 
alteration, disclosure, or destruction. We undertake a range of security measures including 
physical access restraints, technical security monitoring, and internal security reviews of the 
environment.   We also have polices in place to prohibit employees from viewing personal 
information without business justification.  Additionally, it is our policy to ensure that 
Mozilla employees and contractors are bound by confidentiality obligations.
</p>

<p>
Beginning with Firefox 2.0, Mozilla has additional security features, some of which are provided by 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/legal/privacy/firefox-third-party.html">third-party service providers</a>.
</p>

<p>
The security features available depend on the version of Firefox you are using.  Please see 
the end of this privacy policy for older versions of Firefox.

      <em>Secure Website Certificate Verification</em>.  When you visit a secure website, Firefox 
      will check with the certificate provider to validate that website’s certificate.  Firefox 
      sends only the certificate identification to the certificate provider, not the exact URL 
      you are visiting.  If the certificate is not valid, you will receive an error page that 
      states the certificate was revoked and you will not be able to access that website.  The 
      technical name for this process is OCSP or On-line Certificate Status Protocol.  You 
      may completely turn off the secure website certificate verification feature in Firefox’s 
      preferences under the encryption tab.  If you do this, none of the information 
      discussed here will be sent to any third party certificate provider.  An 
      <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Options+window+-+Advanced+panel?bl=n&amp;s=OCSP#Certificates">article in our Firefox Knowledge Base</a> 
      gives you information about changing your preferences.  
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Protection Against Suspected Forgery and Attack Sites Features</em>.  The Firefox forgery 
      and attack protection feature displays a warning if the website you are visiting is 
      suspected of impersonating a legitimate website (commonly referred to as a phishing 
      or forgery website) or a site that infiltrates or damages a computer system without 
      your informed consent, including, without limitation, any computer viruses, worms, 
      trojan horses, spyware, computer contaminant and/or other malicious and unwanted 
      software (commonly called an attack site or malware).  By default, Firefox checks the 
      web pages that you visit against a blacklist that is downloaded to your hard drive at 
      regularly scheduled intervals (e.g., approximately twice per hour), the rate of 
      frequency may change from time to time.  The blacklist does not include the full URL 
      of each suspicious site. Instead, each URL is hashed (obscured so it can't be read) and 
      then broken into portions. Only a portion of each hashed URL is included on the 
      blacklist on your hard drive. If there is a match, Firefox will check with its third party 
      provider to ensure that the website is still on the blacklist.  The information sent 
      between Firefox and its third party provider(s) are hashed URLs.  In fact, multiple 
      hashed URLs are sent with the real hash so that the third party provider(s) will not 
      know what site you are visiting.  If there is a match, Firefox displays either a 
      “Reported Web Forgery” or “Reported Attack Site” alert, as applicable.  
    </p>

    <p>
      You may completely turn off the forgery and/or attack site protection features in 
      Firefox’s preferences.  If you do this, none of the information discussed here will be 
      downloaded to your hard drive or sent to any third party service provider.  An
      <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Options+window+-+Security+panel?bl=n&amp;s=suspected%20web%20forgery">article in our Firefox Knowledge Base</a> 
      gives you information about changing your preferences.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Each time Firefox checks in with a third party provider to download a new blacklist, 
      Non-Personal Information and Potentially Personal Information, such as the 
      information that the browser sends every time you visit a website as well as the 
      version number of the blacklist on your system, is sent to a third party provider.  In 
      order to safeguard your privacy, Firefox will not transmit the complete URL of web 
      pages that you visit to anyone other than Mozilla and its service providers.  While it is 
      possible that a third party service provider may determine the actual URL from the 
      hashed URL sent, Mozilla’s policy is to require its third party service providers to 
      enter into a written agreement with Mozilla not to use any data or other information 
      about or from users of Firefox  for purposes other than to provide and maintain their 
      service.  In addition, Mozilla’s policy is to prohibit these third party service providers 
      from correlating any Firefox user data with any other data collected through other 
      products, services or web properties of that provider.  These third party service 
      providers may post about additional notices regarding their applicable privacy 
      policies.  (For example, see 
      <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/firefox3_privacy.html">Google Safe Browsing Service in Mozilla Firefox Version 3.</a>)

    <p>
      Please note that we’re not yelling at you in this paragraph.  Our lawyers have advised us that 
      we need to make sure this information is conspicuous so you’ll read it.  <strong>The forgery and 
      attack site protection feature is provided “as is” and for your information as advice and 
      guidance only.  Mozilla and its contributors, licensors and partners do not guarantee 
      that these protection features will prevent you from being deceived by a malicious 
      website and we strongly recommend that you continue to be vigilant while online, 
      particularly when following links sent to you in e-mail.</strong>

<h3>Legally Required Disclosures</h3>

<p>
Mozilla may be required to disclose information to the government or others.  This may 
happen if we receive a valid search warrant, subpoena, court order, or other legal mandate.  
For example, the DMCA framework (specifically in Section 512(h)) contains an expedited 
subpoena process for copyright holders to request and receive information service providers 
have regarding the identity of alleged copyright infringers.  
</p>

<h3>Other Disclosures</h3>

<p>
In certain other limited situations, Mozilla may disclose your Personal Information, such as 
when necessary to protect our websites and operations (e.g., against attacks); to protect the 
rights, privacy, safety, or property of Mozilla or its  users; to enforce our terms of service; 
and to pursue available legal remedies. Additionally, Mozilla may need to transfer Personal 
Information to an affiliate or successor in the event of a change of our corporate structure or 
status, such as in the event of a restructuring, sale, or bankruptcy.
</p>

<h3>Service Providers</h3>

<p>
We work with third parties who provide services (like companies that help us determine the 
number of users of Firefox and various features of Firefox) and content delivery networks 
and other services of an administrative nature.  We may share Personal Information about 
you with such third parties for the purpose of enabling these third parties to provide such 
services.
</p>

<h3>Transfer of Data to the U.S.</h3>

<p>
Mozilla is a global organization and operates in different countries. Privacy laws and 
common practices vary from country to country. Some countries may provide for less legal 
protection of your personal data; others may provide more legal protection. By using Firefox, 
you consent to the transfer of the information collected, as outlined by this Policy, to Mozilla 
or its third party service providers in the United States, the Netherlands, and other places 
where our distributed, third party content delivery network exists (which is in several 
countries around the world), which countries may provide a lesser level of data security than 
in your country of residence.
</p>

<h3>Data Retention</h3>

<p>
We will retain any information collected for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes 
outlined in this Policy unless a longer retention period is required by law and/or regulations.  
</p>

<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

<p>
Mozilla may change the Firefox Privacy Policy from time to time.  Any and all changes will 
be reflected on this page.  When Mozilla changes this policy in a material way, a notice will 
be posted on <a href="http://www.mozilla.com">www.mozilla.com</a>.  
Substantive changes may also be announced through the 
standard mechanisms by which Mozilla communicates with its users and community, 
including Mozilla's "announce" 
<a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/announce">mailing list</a> and 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.announce/topics">newsgroup</a>.  
It is your responsibility to ensure that you understand 
the terms of this Privacy Policy.  You should periodically check 
this page for any changes to the current policy.
</p>

<h3>For More Information</h3>

<p>
You may request access, correction, or deletion of Personal Information or Potentially 
Personal Information, as permitted by law.  We will seek to comply with such requests, 
provided that we have sufficient information to identify the Personal Information or 
Potentially Personal Information related to you.

  <dd>
    <p>
      For these earlier versions of Firefox, “Talkback” is Firefox’s crash reporting feature.  
      Talkback also gives you the option to provide your Personal Information and Potentially 
      Personal Information (including your name, email address, and the url you were visiting) and 
      Potentially Personal Information (including your computer’s name, IP address, and the 
      processes you were running at the time of the crash).  You can selectively disable the sending 
      of this information.  Additionally, you have the option to include the URL of the site you 
      were visiting when Firefox crashed, a comment, and your email address in the report.  
      Mozilla only makes Non-Personal Information and Potentially Personal Information in the 
      public reports available online at 
      <a href="http://talkback-public.mozilla.org/">http://talkback-public.mozilla.org/</a>.

    <p>
      <em>Protection Against Suspected Forgery Sites</em>. The Firefox web forgery protection 
      feature displays a warning if the website you are visiting is suspected of 
      impersonating a legitimate website.  Firefox lets you select various levels of 
      protection, and different information is transmitted by Firefox depending on the level 
      you choose.  
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, Firefox checks the web pages that you visit against a list of suspected web 
      forgeries (a “blacklist”) that is downloaded to your hard drive at regularly scheduled 
      intervals (e.g., approximately twice per hour), the rate of frequency may change from 
      time to time.  If there is a match, Firefox displays a “Suspected Web Forgery” alert.  
      Each time Firefox checks in with the third party provider to download a new 
      blacklist, Non-Personal Information and Potentially Personal Information, such as the 
      information that the browser sends every time you visit a website as well as the 
      version number of the blacklist on your system, is sent to the third party provider.  In 
      order to safeguard your privacy, Firefox will not transmit the URL of web pages that 
      you visit in this default mode to anyone other than Mozilla and its service providers. 
    </p>

    <p>
      You may completely turn off the web forgery protection feature in Firefox’s 
      preferences.  If you do this, none of the information discussed here will be 
      downloaded to your hard drive or sent to any third party service provider.
    </p>
