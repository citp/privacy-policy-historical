            <p>
              Cookies:
            </p>
            <p>
              Getaround sends a "cookie" to your computer or smart phone that contains an identification number that is unique to the device you are using. We use this cookie to provide you with a seamless experience, and so that we can record how our service is being used. A cookie does not collect personal information about you, but may convey anonymous information about how you browse the Service to us. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
            </p>
            <p>
              IP Address and Logins: We log each visit to each web page on the Service. A log entry can contain information typically found in the "header" of your web browser's request such as the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day. We may also log your cookie's identification number and the URL of the last site you visited. This log information is important for security, audit, quality improvement, as well as for monitoring the health of our Service.

            <p>
              Information:
            </p>
            <p>
              When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from your Company account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Company better for our users.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Data Gathered from In-Vehicle Hardware:</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>The Car Kit installed in each Getaround car allows us to gather information about your vehicle use, including time of use, location, speed of travel, and other aspects of your vehicle use. We use this information 1) to provide you with the Service 2) to aggregate your use habits and potentially provide you with related benefits such as better insurance rates or other perks for safe driving 3) to record vehicle movements and driver behavior in case of an accident or theft 4) to aggregate your data with other drivers' data and better understand how people use our Service and how we can make it even better for you in the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Location Tracking:
            </p>
            <p>
              The location of all Getaround cars you use is tracked by GPS and conveyed to Getaround. Location information is tracked both on your Getaround-enabled smart phone and by the vehicle's Car Kit. We will never use this information to make your location or movements public without your permission. As a car Owner, you can control when and where other Getaround Users can see the location of your car while parked. If you are renting a car, the Owner of the car may be able to see the location of the rented car. Other than that, other Users will not be able to see your movements in a Getaround car unless you choose to enable ride-sharing features, which will necessarily make this information public so that you can find other people to share rides with.
            </p>
            <p>
              We monitor all cars to prevent theft, and to allow us to locate you in case of accident, emergency, lock-out, etc. Your location information will only be used in direct relation to Getaround business, and may be released to insurance companies, the police, or similar parties in the due course of investigating and processing accident claims, and providing you with help in the case of an emergency or lock-out.
            </p>
            <p>
              How We Use Your Information
            </p>
            <p>
              We Will Never Spam You
            </p>
            <p>
              We will only send you information directly related to your use of Getaround. You control when and how (e.g. email, SMS, etc.) we send most messages to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              By providing Getaround your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. You also agree that we may send you notifications of activity on the Service to the email address you give us, in accordance with any applicable privacy settings. For instance, if you are a car Owner, we will send you information about your car's rental status. You can turn these notifications off or modify how often and in what form you receive them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Getaround may send you other messages in the course of operation of our Service, such as notifications from other Users, updates about Service changes and features, and important news that may impact your use of Getaround. These communications are considered directly related to your use of Getaround, and may contain banners, ads, or promotional material. You may opt out of certain messages as permitted by your settings on the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following termination or deactivation of your Member account, Getaround may retain your profile information and User Content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes, or to maintain and improve the Service -- for instance, for the safety of other Users, we may need access to information about cars you have used in case one of those cars is in an accident. Furthermore, Getaround may retain and continue to use indefinitely all information (including User Content) contained in your communications to other Users or posted to public or semi-public areas of the Service after termination or deactivation of your Member account.
            </p>
            <p>
              Proper Use
            </p>
            <p>
              Getaround support staff may review your personal information to provide the Service to you, if you request us to do so as part of a support call, to provide safety and security benefits (for instance, to offer rewards programs and preferentially lower rates for safe drivers), where it is required by law, and to maintain or diagnose issues with our Service.

            <p>
              How We Share Your Information
            </p>
            <p>
              Personally Identifiable Information:
            </p>
            <p>
              Getaround will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others. Getaround may share your personally identifiable information with third parties solely for the purpose of providing the Service to you. If we do this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Getaround (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).
            </p>
            <p>
              As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings. If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Getaround will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our
              <a href="/tos">Terms of Service,</a>
              take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Getaround, our Users or others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sharing of Your Information with Business Partners; Expanded Service
            </p>
            <p>
              We may use information about you in partnership with outside companies in the course of providing you with additional services related to Getaround, such as ride-sharing or parking benefits. When you purchase, register, or otherwise express interest in a product or service offered by a third party through Getaround or sponsored on our site, you consent to our sharing your personal information with those parties. When you choose to participate in rewards programs, contests, discount offers, or other programs that involve third parties, you authorize Getaround to share your personal information with those parties. Such third parties are authorized to use information that is disclosed to them, in accordance with contracts and agreements between Getaround and third parties. In these cases we will only share the information reasonably needed to provide you with service. Information that is shared with third parties is subject to the privacy policies of those parties, which may differ from Getaround's privacy policies. By sharing this information, you agree that Getaround is not liable or responsible for the actions or inactions of third parties.

            </p>
            <p>
              We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Getaround services.

            <p>
              Getaround may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Getaround. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. Getaround does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Getaround to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The Getaround Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information.

              How We Protect Your Information
            </p>
            <p>
              Getaround uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information and implement your privacy settings. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Getaround and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Getaround makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
            </p>
            <p>
              To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Getaround, at all times.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Getaround will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.

              Children's Privacy
            </p>
            <p>
              Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Getaround does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register as Members. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Getaround. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at support@Getaround.com
