# Privacy policy

GetSmarter recognises the importance of protecting your ("the user") personal information. We have put together and follow a policy that respects this.  


### Information collection

GetSmarter is the sole owner of the information collected on GetSmarter's marketing and student websites (“the sites”). We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. GetSmarter collects information from the user at several different points on the sites.  


### What information does GetSmarter collect on the sites? 

Firstly, we keep track of the user’s IP address. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent at the site, pages viewed and so on. GetSmarter uses this information to determine how you use the site so that we can improve its content and usability. GetSmarter assumes no obligation to protect this information, and may copy, distribute or otherwise use such information without limitation.

Secondly, we log browser types, access times, URLs from which visitors came to the site and URLs viewed by visitors while on the site. Except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy, we do not provide this information to third parties.

Thirdly, when downloading a course information pack or registering for a course, we ask the user to provide us with personal information. This information may include, but is not limited to, the user’s name, cellphone number and email address. GetSmarter does not collect personal information about a user unless it is voluntarily provided to our company so that we can serve the user’s needs and our legitimate business purposes as stated here. For example, when the user registers for a course, we need to retain certain personal information in order to process the user’s registration form, register the user on the GetSmarter learning website, and issue a certificate upon successful completion of the course. The information will be treated confidentially within our company, as we protect all other confidential information. The user can choose not to provide certain information, but might then not be able to take advantage of our services.

### With whom does GetSmarter share data?

We will not voluntarily disclose any information about individual users, except as described in this privacy policy, or to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process.  


### Credit card transactions and security

Credit card transactions will be acquired for GetSmarter by Virtual Card Services (Pty) Ltd, which is the approved payment gateway in South Africa. Virtual Card Services uses SSL3 and no credit card details are stored on GetSmarter's website. Users may go to www.vcs.co.za to view Virtual Card Services’ security certificate and security policy. All encryption complies with international standards. Encryption is used to protect the transmission of personal information when completing online transactions. Virtual Card Services’ internet servers are protected by firewalls and intrusion detection systems.  


### Customer details separate from card details

Customer details will be stored by GetSmarter separately from card details, which are entered by the client on Virtual Card Services’ secure site.   


### What choices are available regarding collection, use and distribution of the information (opt-out policy)?

In our marketing email communications, we will have instructions on how to unsubscribe so that you will not receive any future emails from us if you so choose.  


### What procedures have been designed to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under GetSmarter's control?

GetSmarter takes every precaution to protect the user’s information. We also do everything in our power to protect user information offline. Access to all of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.

If you have more questions about security issues, you are welcome to complete our “contact us” form with your queries.

### Registered student communications and copyright

If a user registers for a course and the course has begun, we will send the user regular email and SMS updates to encourage the learning process. Registered students are not able to unsubscribe from these updates, which contain important information about the course. 

Throughout the course, the registered student retains full copyright over all written pieces submitted and GetSmarter does not make any claim to these rights.

### Contact information

If the user has any questions about this privacy policy or about GetSmarter's information collection practices, please contact us at on the telephone number listed on www.GetSmarter.co.za.  


### The terms "the user" and "user"

The terms "the user" and "user" are used interchangeable and refer to all individuals and entities accessing this website for any reason.
