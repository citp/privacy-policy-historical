## Collection of Information

 _Legal Basis for Collecting and Processing Personal Information_  
GetSmarter collects and processes your personal information when we have lawful bases for doing so. These lawful bases include when you provide consent, when we have a contractual obligation to collect or process your personal data, and when we have a legitimate interest (e.g., to communicate with you regarding the short courses/programs (each, a “Course”), to use data for analytics purposes, to prevent fraud, to report possible criminal acts or threats to public security to a competent authority) in processing your personal information.

 _Information You Provide_  
GetSmarter collects information from you when you choose to provide it to us. For example, we may collect your information when you submit a form requesting information about a Course or about other courses offered at other schools, otherwise provide information to us through the Websites, or otherwise contact us. The information we collect may include personal information, such as your contact details, government issued identifier, or other information that can be used to identify you or can be attributed to you, or non-personal information. In some cases, you may choose not to provide us with your information, but we may require it when necessary to perform a contract or to comply with a legal obligation. We also may use information about you for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we originally collected your information and where such use is lawful.

 _Information Automatically Collected_  
When you visit the Websites or interact with e-mails that we send to you, we may passively collect information from you and store that information on our server logs, including your internet protocol address (“IP address”), browser type, operating system, device identifier, device model, software version, or mobile or ISP carrier information. We also use Cookies and other technologies to collect information about your visit to the Websites, such as the date and time of your visit, the information you searched to find the Websites, or your activity on the Websites. “Cookies” are small files which may be stored on your computer during your use of the Websites and contain data about your use of the Websites. We may use session Cookies (which expire when you close your browser) or persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to understand more about your activity on the Websites or on other websites.

 _Tracking Options and California Do Not Track Disclosures_. You may adjust your browser or operating system settings to limit this tracking or to decline or delete Cookies, but you may be unable to access or use certain areas of the Websites. Check the “Help” menu of your browser or operating system to learn how to change your tracking settings or Cookie preferences. On your mobile device, you can adjust your privacy and advertising settings to limit your tracking for advertising or control whether you receive more relevant advertising. Note that our systems may not recognize Do Not Track headers or requests from some or all browsers.

We may use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services or other offers that may be of interest to you, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.

We may combine the information we receive from and about you, via the Websites and from third parties, to help us tailor our communications to you and to improve the Websites.

Failure to provide certain information may make it difficult or impossible for you to access some services through the Websites (for example, to register for and complete courses). You will need to ensure that personal information submitted to us is accurate and up-to-date (for example, we need a current email address to communicate with you about the Course in which you are enrolled).

## Information Security and Data Retention

We are committed to protecting the security of your information. We maintain what we believe to be appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure your information and to prevent unauthorized access, maintain accuracy, and ensure appropriate use of your information. The accuracy, safety, and security of your information also depend on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask that you not share your password with anyone. Even though we do our best to protect your information, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure, and we cannot guarantee our security measures. We are not responsible for any unauthorized access to or acquisition of your information.

We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide you with the services through the Website or to otherwise administer and maintain the services and our Website.
