Updated: January 23rd, 2012

**WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS**

We at Getonic want you to feel safe online. For that reason, we follow a privacy policy that applies to all of the services, products and web pages offered by the website, or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies. In line with that policy, we want to let you know how we treat personal information that we collect and receive from the website's visitors.

Capitalized words not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given to them in the [General Terms of Use](http://www.getonic.com/TermsOfUse.aspx)

Personal information is information about you like your name, address, email address, phone number and other information which specifically identify you.

The term, ("website"), as used in this Privacy Policy, refers to either Getonic, or the Getonic website.

This Privacy Policy covers: (i) information you post and/or share with us on the website, and other information which we collect and use, including how we generally use that information; (ii) what we share and disclose and with whom; (iii) what "cookies" and "web beacons" are, and how we use them; (iv) how to update and delete your account information; (v) how you will be notified of changes to our Privacy Policy; and (vi) how and whom to contact if you have a question or a suggestion regarding our Privacy Policy.

The Privacy Policy applies only to the website. While other websites may be displayed as search results or links on the website, including when payment processing is made via the website, those sites are owned and operated by others, and they invariably have different privacy policies (and including other terms of use). When linking from the website to other sites, if you have privacy concerns, we urge you to review the privacy policies of those sites independently. You are advised that in the event that we are informed by other sites that you are using the website, directly or indirectly, to breach the privacy policy of such other sites and/or the terms and conditions of such other site, we reserve the right to immediately terminate your account with us. 

**It's also important to note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you post, yourself, in public areas of the website.** For example, if you choose to let other people see your name, your answers to questions posted on the website, or if you post information or comments on a discussion board, that information will be made public and the Privacy Policy and the terms herein shall not apply to such information. Your messages and other information you make available in public areas of the website will be seen by people and organizations not related to or controlled by Getonic, and may be used by others to contact you.

We do not rent, sell or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide Goods or services you request, when we have your permission or under the following circumstances: (i) we provide the information to trusted partners who work on our behalf or with the website under confidentiality agreements.

However, these companies do not have independent rights to share this information; (ii) we may sometimes share aggregate non-personal information with third parties such as the media, advertisers, government agencies and other commercial entities. This aggregate information is typically in the form of statistics, such as the number of website members who live in a particular state or fall within a particular age group or gender. Such aggregate information is gathered from individual website members information but is not traceable to any specific identifiable website member; (iii) we respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; (iv) we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the website [Terms of Use](http://www.getonic.com/TermsOfUse.aspx) or as otherwise required or permitted by law; (v) if we and/or the website are acquired by or merged with or into another company, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

**USING INFORMATION**

We enable you to share personal and financial information to complete transactions and collect payments. We encourage you to disclose your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users. We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information and therefore we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information. To help protect your privacy, to the extent under our control we allow only limited access to other users' contact, delivery and financial information to facilitate transactions and collect payments. When users are involved in a transaction, they [may have access](http://pages.ebay.com/help/tp/contacting-members.html#contact) to each other's name, ID, email address and other contact and delivery information. In all cases, you must give other users a chance to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them. Any use of information you receive and/or accumulate from other website users, should be used by you only to complete transactions; deliver the Goods and/or services purchased, and any other use specifically consented to by the other user.

**OUR ADVERTISERS**

We do not share your personal information with our advertisers. However, the advertising we display is targeted to users of a particular Goods, services and/or content. So if you view or click on a targeted ad, the advertiser (or other companies affiliated with the advertiser) may assume that you meet the targeting criteria.

**COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS**

The website, like many websites, uses cookies to prepare customized web pages for you. A cookie is a file containing a string of code that we transfer to your computer's hard drive, to be kept there for later use. With cookies in place, whenever you use your web browser to connect to the website, our systems are able to recognize you. This enables the website to present you with custom web pages. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page, you may see a welcome page with your name on it and information that relates to where you live and Goods or services that reflect your interests.

In addition to the website's cookies, when you visit the website your computer may receive cookies from our advertisers and from other sites displayed as search results or links. The cookies inserted by those third parties are not covered by the website's Privacy Policy, but rather, by the policies of those advertisers and outside websites.

You can set up your browser to reject cookies or tell you when a cookie has been sent. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of the website's interactive features, and we hope you will leave them turned on.

The website also uses web beacons (also known as action tags or single pixel gifs) to access the website's cookies inside and outside our web pages and in connection with the website products and services. A web beacon is a transparent image placed on a web page that sends a signal when a person visits that page. This enables us to assess the popularity and effectiveness of the material posted on the website. We may also use web beacons in connection with e-mails sent to those who have registered on the website, to let us know whether and when the e-mail was opened. No personal information is transmitted through web beacons.

**SPAM, SPYWARE AND SPOOFING**

Spamming is considered by us as un-acceptable practice. You do not have the authority to add our other website users and/or visitors, including users who purchased Goods and/or services from you, to your mailing list (electronic or otherwise mail), unless you receive their explicit consent. To report spam or spoof emails to us, please forward the email to  _[tellus@getonic.com](mailto:tellus@getonic.com)_. Our communication tools are not to be used by you to send spam or content that would violate our Term of Use and/or this Privacy Policy. 

**THIRD PARTY AD SERVING**

The website contracts with third party companies to help make sure that our content and advertising are relevant and effective, and to analyze how visitors use our site. To do this, we use web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The type of information we collect includes, for example, the pages you visited on the website. This information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which Goods and/or services are most interesting and what kind of offers our visitors like to see. Although our third party marketing partners manage the information streamed from the website on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our website, Goods and/or services offered and marketing strategy, we ask that you do not make use of the website and the services and content. 

The ads on the website pages are delivered to you by third parties specializing agencies and other corporate entities. Information about your visit to the website, such as the number of times you viewed an ad, is used to serve ads to you whenever you visit the website. 

The website utilizes third party advertising companies to serve a portion of the ads on the website. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information about users' visits to the website in order to improve their offer.

**YOUR ABILITY TO UPDATE AND DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND PREFERENCES**

You can update your website account information, at any time, other than your user name. 

New categories of marketing communications may be added to the account settings page from time to time. Those who have registered on the website who visit this page can opt out of receiving future marketing communications from these new categories or they can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages they receive. 

We reserve the right to send you certain important communications relating to the website services, such as service announcements and administrative messages, throughout the term of your personal website account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving these important communications. 

You can terminate your website account at any time by sending a request.
