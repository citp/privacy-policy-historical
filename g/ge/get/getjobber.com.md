  1. It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
  2. We transfer information about you if OctopusApp is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, OctopusApp will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
