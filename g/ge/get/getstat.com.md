# Privacy Policy | STAT

Skip to content

The getSTAT website (www.getSTAT.com) (the “Website”) is operated by STAT Search Analytics Incorporated (referred to as “SSAI”, “we”, “us” or “our”, below). We use the Website to provide information about our services.

We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy, and we support a general policy of openness about how we collect, use and disclose your personal information. This Privacy & Security Policy informs you how SSAI collects, uses and discloses the personal information that you provide to us through use of our Website and accessing our services. By visiting the Website or otherwise using any SSAI online service, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy & Security Policy.

We recommend that you take the time to read this Policy so that you understand how we handle and process information, including personal information. As we develop and expand our services, this Policy may also change. We will include a “last amended” date on the Policy as displayed on the Website. We strongly encourage you to refer back to the Policy periodically.

This Policy also explains how you can contact us if you have a question about our privacy practices, want to change or update your personal information or change your preferences concerning our use and disclosure of your personal information.

For the purpose of this Policy, “personal information” means information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee or volunteer of an organization. SSAI will not collect, use or disclose your personal information in a way that is incompatible with this Policy.

## 1\. How We Collect and Use Personal Information via the Website

**Answering Queries**  
You may contact us via a form that appears on the Website. If you do, we ask for your name and an email address. We use this information to communicate with you with respect to your inquiries. Alternatively, you may contact us via the email address posted on the Website. If you do so, we’ll be provided your email address and any other information you choose to disclose to us. Again, we will use this information to communicate with you with respect to your inquiries.  
As these functions are necessary to the proper administration of your inquiry, we do not offer an opt-out from providing a name or email address for such communications.  
Except as may be required by law or provided herein, we will not use this information for third party marketing or any other purpose.  
**Cookies and Web Logs**  
When you visit the Website, cookies are placed within the memory of your internet access device. A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can store via your web browser for later retrieval. We use permanent cookies to help us track use of our Website, such as the number and frequency of visits to our pages and which parts of our Website are visited. Most browsers will allow you to disable cookies, and you may do so if you wish.  
SSAI collects aggregate information concerning usage of the Website through automatically logged information (for example, statistics that identify our most popular pages). SSAI does not use any personal information while generating this information, nor does it relate any of this information to an individual member or user.

## 2\. Updating Your Personal Information

You may update or change your personal information anytime by sending an email to contact@getSTAT.com.

## 3\. Knowledge and Consent

SSAI collects personal information about you only when you voluntarily provide it. Typically, we will seek consent for the use or disclosure of your personal information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, consent may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when we want to use information for a purpose not previously identified).  
The form of consent that we seek, including whether it is express or implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of the individual in the circumstances.  
You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. If you wish to withdraw your consent at any time, please contact us at contact@getSTAT.com. We will inform you of the implications of withdrawing consent.  
We will not, as a condition of the supply of a SSAI service, require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information beyond that reasonably required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes for which the information is being provided.

## 4\. When We Disclose Your Personal Information

SSAI will not sell, license, trade or rent your personal information. SSAI will not otherwise disclose your personal information except as described below.  
SSAI may also disclose personal information about its members to a third party if (a) a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order legally requires or authorizes us to do so; or (b) necessary to enforce and protect the terms and conditions of our agreement(s) with you or the Terms of Use applicable to our Website.  
SSAI also reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale, lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal or financing of all or any portion of SSAI or of any of the business or assets or shares of SSAI, provided that the third party represents that it will continue to use the information for the purposes set out in this Policy and in accordance with applicable privacy protection laws.

## 5\. Retention of Your Personal Information

We retain your personal information only for so long as permitted by applicable laws.

## 6\. How We Protect Your Personal Information 

SSAI uses commercially reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from loss, unauthorized access, misuse or theft. Only SSAI staff who have a legitimate business purpose for accessing the personal information collected by SSAI are authorized to do so. And on systems used to access SSAI data, we encrypt files containing your account information. Unauthorized access to or use of personal information by anyone affiliated with SSAI is prohibited and constitutes grounds for disciplinary action.

## 7\. Links to Third Party Sites 

The Website contains links to other third party websites. You should be aware that operators of linked websites may also collect your personal information (including information generated through the use of cookies) when you link to their websites. SSAI is not responsible for how such third parties collect, use or disclose your personal information, so it is important to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of these websites before providing your personal information on those sites.

## Contacting Us 

In the event that you have any questions about the SSAI Privacy & Security Policy or if you have reason to believe that we may have failed to adhere to this Policy, you may contact us by sending an email to contact@getSTAT.com.
