We have no control of or responsibility for linked websites and provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors. You access such linked Websites at your own risk.

<p>Also, we may contract with third-party service providers to provide certain services for our business, such as processing your financial information to determine credit-worthiness, credit card processing, computer system services, data management, or promotional services. We provide the information needed for these service providers to perform these services.

<p>You understand that if you are seeking automotive financing, you may have one or more credit reports pulled by those of our affiliates who would offer you automotive financing or assist in the determination of providing you automotive financing.</p>

<p>We may share information that we have collected with governmental agencies and other organizations assisting us in fraud prevention or for investigative purposes. We may do so when permitted or mandated by law; trying to protect against or prevent fraud; attempting to prevent unauthorized or improper transactions; or investigating fraud or improper conduct that has already taken place.
