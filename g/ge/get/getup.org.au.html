                    <li>When you first take action on a GetUp campaign, the Personal Information we collect generally includes email address, first name and last name, home and mobile phone numbers, and home address.</li>

                    <li>As you take subsequent actions on GetUp campaigns, the Personal Information we collect generally includes the actions you take with GetUp, the donations you make to GetUp (and other information you give to us when donating, like bank details or credit card details), your phone number if you dial in to our phone banking system, information you give to us when completing surveys, like gender and date of birth, and information contained in feedback or complaints.</li>

                <p>GetUp is one of Australia's largest and most effective progressive campaigning organisations. Our vision is a more fair, flourishing and just Australia, led by the values and hopes of everyday people. Our mission is to create a thriving democracy by giving everyday Australians the chance to make extraordinary impact – online, across the airwaves, and in the streets. We never collect, hold, use or disclose Personal Information other than in pursuit of this vision, mission, and our functions or activities.</p>

                <p>We make sure that GetUp only holds, uses and discloses Personal Information for the purpose for which it was collected. We will not use or disclose Personal Information for a purpose other than that for which it was collected unless:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>you have consented to this use or disclosure;</li>
                    <li>GetUp is required to, or authorised to, by the law or a court or tribunal order; or</li>

                    <b>Collection, holding and use of Personal Information</b>
                    <br> We collect, hold and use Personal Information about you so that we can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>run effective campaigns in line with our goals and values;</li>
                    <li>communicate with you about our campaigns and activities by email as well as via other forms of direct marketing, give you the opportunity to participate in our campaigns and activities, and tailor the opportunities we give to you, for example to your campaigning priorities and location;</li>
                    <li> provide you with opportunities to chip in to our campaigns and activities, make it easy for you to make donations, and tailor the donations we ask of you to affordable amounts;</li>
                    <li>analyse and research our member and donor base so that we can better retain and attract members and donors and grow our people powered movement;</li>
                    <li>measure the effectiveness of our campaigns and activities so that we can improve them and scale our impact;</li>
                    <li>deliver administrative functions like responding to feedback or complaints, processing donations, providing receipts and improving our website.</li>

                    <b>Disclosure of Personal Information</b>
                    <br> GetUp never sells, licences or rents your Personal Information. However, there are some purposes for which your Personal Information will be disclosed, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you sign a petition, open letter or similar, GetUp will disclose your first name, last name and postcode to the target or targets of the petition or open letter. Similarly, when you contact an MP or similar through GetUp systems, GetUp will disclose your first name, last name, postcode and email address to the MP or similar. Participating in GetUp campaigns can mean disclosing your name and contact details together with your campaign priorities or political views to a potentially wide range of people.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes GetUp discloses your Personal Information to trusted third parties providing services to GetUp, such as trusted call centre providers, direct mail providers, digital advertising platforms and research organisations that we work with. Occasionally we disclose it to trusted and like-minded Australian non-government organisations. This is to ensure we are working as effectively as possible with these trusted third parties and organisations to contact you about campaigns or activities which we believe could be of interest to you. We take reasonable steps to ensure that these third parties are bound by privacy and confidentiality obligations when handling your Personal Information.  </li>

                    <br> Some of the trusted third parties providing services to GetUp are in the United States, so it is possible that your Personal Information will be disclosed overseas.

                </p>
                <p>GetUp takes reasonable steps to ensure that any overseas recipient of your Personal Information complies with Australian Privacy Principles in the <i>Privacy Act 1988</i> (Cth), or is subject to another law or scheme that is substantially similar to the Australian Privacy Principles. If neither of these situations apply, GetUp will not disclose your Personal Information to an overseas recipient unless it is otherwise authorised to do so.</p>
