### Get4x Privacy Policy

Concerned about how your personal data is being collected and used on our site and mobile applications?

We are too.

We understand that your personally identifying information is important to you and we hope this privacy policy will assuage these concerns when using Get4x.

Get4x is a community platform that puts travellers and money changers in touch, to the mutual benefit of both parties. In the process, some user data will be collected and so this privacy policy outlines the way we collect, use and protect your personal information.

At 4xLabs, our mission is to bring about greater price transparency in the cash exchange industry, and so it makes sense that we are transparent when it comes to the type of data we collect from you and what we do with it. Do review our privacy policy below for more details, and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at [feedback@get4x.com](http://get4x.com/en/feedback).
