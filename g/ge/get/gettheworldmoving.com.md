We may also ask about your interests, but it is your choice whether to respond.

We collect certain personal health information such as your height, weight and gender and display your BMI to you based on these inputs.

We may use or disclose your information for reporting purposes. For instance, we may use and disclose information about your participation in the GCC, aggregate performance information, and summary information about participants. We may also use or disclose your information for research purposes. For instance, we may use or disclose your information to better understand aggregate sleep patterns and daily active movement.

## Anonymous information

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyse trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site, to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole and report aggregated data to our advertisers. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

## Disclosure of your information

We will not, without your consent, sell or otherwise disclose your personal information to a third party, or make any other use of your personal information, for any purpose which is not related to your use of the Website, Mobile Applications and Services, unless otherwise permitted to do so by law. . Unless in using the Website or Mobile Applications you expressly or impliedly agree to make certain information available, all personal information which we collect is kept confidential to the best of our ability, subject to the other terms and conditions of this privacy policy. In addition, our employees and contractors who provide services related to our Website or Mobile Applications are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by us. Our employed staff and contractors engaged by us for technical and support purposes may have access to personal information that you provide and may access it for purposes that include the audit of content on the Website or Mobile Applications for quality control purposes and for compliance with our Website [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms).

We may disclose your personal information to overseas recipients, which are located in the United Kingdom, the Unites States of America, Canada or Switzerland.

We may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you.

## Tracking technologies

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts are used by us and our service providers, technology partners or other 3rd party assets (such as social media). These technologies are used to help administer the site, identify the total number of users, measure traffic patterns for research purposes, personalize or customize content so that a user’s preferences can be “remembered” when they return to the site, and to better manage content. 

Get The World Moving may collect information via cookies. If Get The World Moving collects personal information via cookies, then that personal information will be dealt with by Get The World Moving in accordance with this privacy policy. In other words, information collected via cookies will be treated in the same way as any other information. You can remove cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited. 

We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML 5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 or Flash to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML 5. 

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or click-stream data. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.

This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, metrics, performance data, crash reports, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.

## Behavioral Advertising

We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

## Protection of personal information

The security of your personal information is important to us. Where utilized for the purpose of transactions, the Website and Mobile Applications use a log-in process to promote the security of usernames and passwords. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) or log-in credentials, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). The Website’s servers are located in a secured data centre with security measures in place.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can contact us at [enquiry@gettheworldmoving.com](mailto:enquiry@gettheworldmoving.com).

## Blog / testimonials / public comments and profiles

Our Website offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [enquiry@gettheworldmoving.com](mailto:enquiry@gettheworldmoving.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, please contact us.
