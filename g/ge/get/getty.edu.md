# Privacy Policy Statement (Getty About Us)

The J. Paul Getty Trust is committed to protecting your privacy. We do not collect your personal information, such as your name, mailing address, or e-mail address, unless you knowingly provide it to us.

Most pages of our Web site contain a link to this privacy policy, which describes what information we collect and how we use it. By using the Getty's Web site or communicating with us by e-mail, you agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy.

**General Policy on Collection of Information**  
We only collect personally identifiable information if you knowingly provide it to us.

We may record your e-mail address if you e-mail us, submit an online form that contains your e-mail address, opt to receive e-mail notices of Getty programs, news, and events, or register for an online service such as Getty Bookmarks or the ArtsEdNet Talk discussion board.

We will never share your e-mail address with anyone.

Our Web server automatically records the IP addresses of visitors to our site. This information is used in aggregate form to helps us understand how visitors use the Getty online environment. The servers at this site also collect connection-related technical data. The data entries in these logs are used for server and network operation and maintenance and to help us understand general usage patterns.

**E-Cards**  
Some pages on this site allow you to send free e-cards to a friend. E-cards are sent as links to a Getty.edu Web page. We do not save, use, or sell senders' or recipients' names or e-mail addresses.

**E-Getty Newsletter**  
The e-Getty newsletter is a free monthly events bulletin sent via e-mail.

To receive the e-Getty newsletter by e-mail, you need to submit your e-mail address. Your e-mail address is stored on secure Getty servers and will not be shared with anyone. When you sign up, you can choose to receive e-Getty in HTML, which includes graphics, or as text only, which does not include graphics.

You can also view the e-Getty newsletter online, without submitting your e-mail address, at http://www.getty.edu/egetty/e-getty.html.

You may stop receiving the e-Getty newsletter at any time. Follow the "unsubscribe" link in the footer of any newsletter.

**Getty Bookmarks**  
To use the Getty Bookmark feature, you need to create an online account. Your e-mail address is used to identify your account and the associated bookmarks. The e-mail address tied to your account is stored on secure Getty servers and will not be used for marketing purposes or shared with anyone. We may occasionally use your e-mail address for purposes related to administration of your online account, such as sending service notices or password reminders.

We use cookies to administer your online account(s). However, we do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information.

If you choose to e-mail Getty Bookmarks to a friend, we will ask you for your friend's e-mail address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time e-mail containing your bookmarks, but we will not store his or her e-mail address or use it for any other purpose.

You may review or change the password(s) for your online account(s) at any time. Log in to Getty Bookmarks and click "Edit Profile" to choose a new password.

You may contact us at [bookmarks@getty.edu](mailto:bookmarks@getty.edu) to request that we remove your e-mail address from our database.

**Planning a School Visit**  
To request a school visit to the Getty, you must submit information about yourself, your school, and the nature of your visit request. This information is used to help us accommodate school visit requests as equitably as possible. The information is recorded and stored in a database by our Education Department and may be used to contact you. We periodically send information to schools and teachers to notify them of additions to our Web site and of new educational programs at the Getty.

If you no longer wish to receive mailings from the Education Department, please call the school line at (310) 440-7322.

**TeacherArtExchange Listserv**  
To use the TeacherArtExchange listserv on this site, you need to create an online account. Your e-mail address is used to identify your account. We will not use your e-mail for marketing purposes or share it with anyone.

The TeacherArtExchange listserv takes place primarily over e-mail. Messages are also archived to our Web site, where they are available in perpetuity. As a subscriber to TeacherArtExchange, you can choose how often you wish to receive e-mail messages from other subscribers.

We may occasionally send you e-mail for purposes related to administration of your online account, such as sending service notices or password reminders.

Please note that information you submit to the TeacherArtExchange listserv is nonconfidential and nonproprietary. TeacherArtExchange is also an unmoderated list. This means that no one reads or edits the e-mail messages sent to TeacherArtExchange before they are distributed to subscribers and archived to our Web site. To protect your privacy, do not send any message to the TeacherArtExchange listserv that contains personally identifiable information such as your name, mailing address, or phone number.

You can [unsubscribe](https://web.archive.org/education/teacherartexchange/unsubscribe.html) from TeacherArtExchange at any time.

**Getty Leadership Institute "Keep Me Posted"**  
We use the information you provide us in our "Keep Me Posted" online form to contact you by e-mail and/or postal mail about seasonal programs offered by the Getty Leadership Institute and about the GLI programs in which you indicate interest on the form.

We do not share your personal information with anyone.

Please note that the names, titles, institutions and state/country location of alumni of the Museum Leadership Institute (formerly MMI) are posted on our Web site and circulated in print form as part of the application brochure for MLI each year.

To be removed from the GLI's mailing lists, send an e-mail to [gli@getty.edu](mailto:gli@getty.edu) with the subject line REMOVE FROM MAILING LISTS. In the body of the e-mail, indicate the name, e-mail address(es), and/or postal address(es) you would like to have removed and specify whether you wish to be removed from the postal mailing list, the e-mail announcement list, or both. If you are an MLI alumnus or alumna, please also indicate whether you wish to be removed from reunion invitations.

**Online Purchases and Catalog Requests**  
If you make an online purchase or request a catalog, we may also collect your e-mail and/or your mailing address to contact you for marketing purposes. We may share the mailing addresses we collect with other reputable publishers to help them contact consumers for marketing purposes.

If you do not want to receive e-mail from Getty Publications in the future, or do not want us to share your mailing address with other publishers, please let us know by e-mailing us at [pubsinfo@getty.edu](mailto:pubsinfo@getty.edu) or by sending a letter to:

Please provide your exact name and address and tell us if you want your name removed from our mailing list, the list we may share with other companies, or both.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data we store on your computer's hard drive. This data contains information about you that we use to help make your visit to the Getty Web site easier. For example, one cookie we may store can remember what kind of video capability you have selected, so that you do not have to choose a bandwidth every time you watch a video.

You do not have to accept any Getty cookies to enjoy and use the Getty Web site; if you reject all Getty cookies you will simply have to re-enter the preferences that we would otherwise record for you.

Getty cookies do not track your activity on this site. Getty cookies will not be disclosed to anyone else, and they are not linked to any information that could identify you personally.

This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by the Getty. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other sites. This privacy statement applies only to this Web site.
