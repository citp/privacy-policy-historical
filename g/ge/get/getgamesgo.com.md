# Privacy Policy | Get Games Go

Get Games Go (" **Get Games Go** ") operates Getgamesgo.com and may operate other websites. It is Get Games Go's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Get Games Go collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Get Games Go's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Get Games Go's visitors use its website. From time to time, Get Games Go may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Get Games Go also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Getgamesgo.com blogs/sites. Get Games Go only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Get Games Go's websites choose to interact with Get Games Go in ways that require Get Games Go to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Get Games Go gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.

Those who engage in transactions with Get Games Go are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Get Games Go collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Get Games Go. Get Games Go does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Get Games Go's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
