Our policy at GoTo Entertainment is that all personal information you provide, such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, and credit card number, is private and confidential. Your personal information is stored in a secure location and is accessible only by designated staff. All information is for internal purposes only, including the information our web site tracks concerning visits. While we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our site, this information is used only to help better serve our members. 

We operate using IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your wagering account. 

GoTo Entertainment also logs IP addresses for system administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user's session. This gives us an idea what parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP address to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will remain anonymous.

GoTo Entertainment will also want to offer promotions to clients who use the web site. To assure the quality of client communications, GoTo Entertainment provides clients with the opportunity to "opt-in" to weekly newsletters. However, there is a certain minimum level of communication needed for a client to play effectively with GoTo Entertainment so everyone with an account will get some notices and promotional emails.

A client who loses their account login information may retrieve it via "Forgot My Log-in Info," found on the login screens of the GoTo Entertainment web site, or by clicking on the relevant FAQ in the Help section. All changes made to account holder information, whether done on-line or by telephone, are logged. It is our policy not to change an account holder's name unless we have an official name change notification on file (e.g. marriage certificate, notice of name change). 

We are strongly opposed to internet Spam. We DO NOT Spam. The only emails sent are to registered members of GoTo Entertainment or its family of sites. We will occasionally send mailers via third party affiliates, however ONLY if those affiliates have asked their client base to OPT IN and receive third party email.
