## 4\. General Information

### 4.1 Will Vero share any of the personal information it receives?

We neither rent nor sell your or your End User Customers’ Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We share such Personal Information in personally identifiable form with third parties as described below.

#### a. Trusted Third Parties:

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide the Services to you. Unless we tell you differently, such third parties do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. This includes third party companies and individuals employed by us to facilitate our Services, including the provision of maintenance services, database management, web analytics and general improvement of the Services. A list of our current Trusted Third Parties can be found [here](https://www.getvero.com/third-parties).

#### b. Business transfers:

We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party, in which case such party will use your Personal Information in line with this Privacy Notice.

#### c. Protection of Vero and others:

We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or a court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Vero, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

#### d. With your consent:

Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.

### 4.2 Legal basis for processing Personal Information (EEA visitors only)

If you are a visitor/customer located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Vero Holdings Australia Pty Ltd is the data controller of your Personal Information.

Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect Personal Information only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.Â  In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you.

If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Information). Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

For more information on the legal basis for processing your information please contact us at [dataprivacy@getvero.com](mailto:dataprivacy@getvero.com) .

### 4.3 Where we store your personal information

Vero has its headquarters and the majority of its operations in Australia.Â  If you interact with, join or share your data with Vero in any of the ways explained in this Privacy Notice then, if you are not also in Australia, your Personal Information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country and, in some cases, may not be as protective.

Specifically, our servers are located in the United States, and our group companies and service providers operate in the United States, Australia and Singapore. This means that when we collect your Personal Information we may process it in any of these countries.

However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that Personal Information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

### 4.4 Is the personal information secure?

Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the Personal Information that we collect and process. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Information. Specific measures we use include encrypting Personal Information in transit and at rest, the implementation of an internal security policy and access control measures for all team members, the use of firewalls and other threat detection technologies, regular backups for data recovery. Whilst we endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, we cannot guarantee complete security. The transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.

The Website may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When following a link to another site you should read that site’s privacy policy.

### 4.7 Data retention and deletion

We retain Personal Information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so, (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives, then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

### 4.8. Changes to this Privacy Notice

We may amend this Privacy Notice from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the time such information is used.
