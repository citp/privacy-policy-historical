# Privacy Policy - Pocketbook

These proposed Privacy and Security Policy will be effective September 30, 2014

Pocketbook is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of any personal information about our users. This Privacy & Security Policy explains how we protect personal information provided through Pocketbook and its Service (the “Service”) via [https://getpocketbook.com](https://web.archive.org/).

“Personal information” for purposes of this Policy means information that identifies you, such as your name, address, phone number, fax number or email address.

Pocketbook stresses its privacy and security standards to guard against identity theft and provide security for your personal information. We regularly re-evaluate our privacy and security policies and adapt them as necessary to deal with new challenges. We strive to maintain best-practice security practices based on industry standards.

WE LIMIT THE COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Certain areas and features of Pocketbook are available to you without registration or the need to provide to us any information. However, other features of the Site or the Service may require registration, which involves providing your email address and a password (collectively the “Registration Information”).

In order to benefit from the full functionality of the Service, you also must provide your third-party account credentials (“Account Credentials”) to allow Pocketbook to access your account data at those other financial institutions (“Account Information”) for your use.

From time to time we may request other personal information to provide you with other benefits of the Service. In all such instances, you will be given the opportunity to provide or to decline to provide that information, and it will be used only for the stated purpose. Pocketbook may make anonymous or aggregate personal information and disclose such data only in a non-personally identifiable manner to:

  * Advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes, such as the number of users who applied for a credit card or how many users clicked on a particular offer;
  * Organisations approved by Pocketbook that conduct research into consumer spending; 
  * Publish, communicate, reproduce or otherwise broadcast our analysis, statistics or research of user data to the public; and
  * Users of the Service for purposes of comparison of their personal financial situation relative to the broader community.



Such information does not identify you individually. Access to your Registration Information, Account Credentials, Account Information and any other personal information you provide is strictly restricted and used in accordance with specific internal procedures and safeguard governing access, in order to operate, develop or improve the Service. These individuals have been selected in accordance with our security policies and practices and are bound by confidentiality obligations. They may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. We may also use third party vendors or service providers to help us provide the Service to you, such as sending email messages on our behalf or hosting and operating a particular feature or functionality of the Service.

Our contracts with these third parties outline the appropriate use and handling of your information and prohibit them from using any of your personal information for purposes unrelated to the product or service they’re providing. We require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them.

CHANGES TO YOUR REGISTRATION INFORMATION

If your Registration Information changes during your subscription to Pocketbook, you may update it any time via the Service.

ONLINE SESSION INFORMATION AND USE IS ONLY USED TO IMPROVE YOUR EXPERIENCE

When you visit Pocketbook, we may collect technical and navigational information, such as computer browser type, Internet protocol address, pages visited, and average time spent on our Site. This information may be used, for example, to alert you to software compatibility issues, or it may be analysed to improve our Web design and functionality.

“Cookies” are alphanumeric identifiers in the form of text files that are inserted and stored by your Web browser on your computer’s hard drive. Pocketbook may set and access cookies on your computer to track and store preferential information about you. Pocketbook may gather information about you through cookie technology. For example, Pocketbook may assign a cookie to you, to limit the amount of times you see a particular Pocketbook Offer or to help better determine which Pocketbook Offers to serve to you. Please note that most Internet browsers will allow you to stop cookies from being stored on your computer and to delete cookies stored on your computer. If you choose to eliminate cookies, the full functionality of the Service may be impaired for you.

We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them.

Web beacons are images embedded in a Web page or email for the purpose of measuring and analysing site usage and activity. Pocketbook, or third party service providers acting on our behalf, may use Web beacons to help us analyse Site usage and improve the Service.

We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities. For example, these service providers may help us measure the performance of our online campaigns or analyse visitor activity on Pocketbook. We may permit these service providers to use cookies and other technologies to perform these services for Pocketbook. We do not share any personal information about our customers with these third party service providers, and these service providers do not collect such information on our behalf. Our third party service providers are required to comply fully with this Privacy and Security Policy.

THIRD PARTIES OFFERING OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES WILL NOT BE GIVEN YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION

There are a number of separate products and services offered by third parties advertised on our Site and through the Service that may be complementary to your use of Pocketbook, such as lenders, banks, credit card issuers, brokerage institutions, retailers and financial service providers (collectively, “Third-Party Offers”). If you choose to use these separate products or services, disclose information to the providers, or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policies. You should evaluate the practices of external services providers before deciding to use their services. Pocketbook is not responsible for their privacy practices. If you click on a link to a third party site, Pocketbook encourages you to check the privacy policy of that site. Pocketbook may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed and whether any action has been taken on a third party Web site. We use this information to improve the quality of the Pocketbook Offers and customised content on the Service.

CONTESTS, GIVEAWAYS AND SURVEYS

From time to time, Pocketbook may offer you the opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways and other promotions. Any information submitted in connection with such activities will be treated in accordance with this Privacy and Security Policy, except as specifically set forth in the rules for those contests, giveaways or promotions. From time to time, Pocketbook may also ask you to participate in surveys designed to help Pocketbook improve the Site. Any personal information provided to Pocketbook in connection with any survey will be used only in relation to that survey and as elsewhere set forth in this Policy.

DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS OR IF REQUIRED BY LAW

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pocketbook reserves the right (and you authorise Pocketbook) to share or disclose your personal information when Pocketbook determines, in its sole discretion, that the disclosure of such information is necessary or appropriate:

  * To enforce our rights against you or in connection with a breach by you of this Privacy and Security Policy or the Pocketbook Terms of Use;
  * To prevent prohibited or illegal activities; or
  * When required by any applicable law, rule regulation, subpoena or other legal process.



YOUR DATA MAY BE TRANFERRED UPON CHANGE OF CONTROL BY ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS POLICY

Personal information may be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganisation or other change of control. If we sell, merge or transfer any part of our business, part of the sale may include your personal information. If so, you will be asked if you’d like to continue receiving promotional information following any change of control.

YOU CAN TRANSPORT OR DELETE YOUR DATA

Your data is yours. You can remove it anytime you want. When you request us to delete your account for the Service, your data will be permanently expunged from our primary production servers and further access to your account will not be possible. We will also promptly disconnect any connection we had established to your Account Information and delete all account credentials. However, portions of your data, consisting of aggregate data derived from your Account Information, may remain on our production servers indefinitely, where such data cannot identify you in any way. Your data may also remain on a backup server or media, however such data will be in a format that cannot identify you as a person. Pocketbook keeps these backups to ensure our continued ability to provide the Service to you in the event of malfunction or damage to our primary production servers. We also reserve the right to use any aggregated or anonymous data derived from or incorporating your personal information.

EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS FROM US

We provide our registered customers with weekly summaries of their Account Information and email alerts. We also allow users to subscribe to email newsletters and from time to time may transmit emails promoting Pocketbook or third-party goods or services.

Pocketbook subscribers have the ability to opt-out of receiving our promotional emails and to terminate their newsletter subscriptions by following the instructions in the emails. Opting out in this manner will not end transmission of service-related emails, such as email alerts.

YOUR DATA IS SECURE

We use a combination of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of your online session and to protect Pocketbook accounts and systems from unauthorised access.

When you register for the Service, Pocketbook requires a password from you for your privacy and security. Pocketbook transmits information such as your Registration Information for Pocketbook or Account Credentials securely.

No employee may put any sensitive content on any insecure machine (i.e., nothing can be taken from the database and put on an insecure laptop). Pocketbook tests the Site regularly for any failure points that would allow hacking.

However, it is important to understand that these precautions apply only to our Site and systems. We exercise no control over how your information is stored, maintained or displayed by third parties or on third-party sites.

OUR SERVICE ENSURES SECURE COMMUNICATION WITH ENCRYPTION

From the time you submit your Login ID and Password, these communications between your computer and Pocketbook are encrypted. This enables client and server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering and message forgery.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Login ID and Password

We maintain strict rules to help prevent others from guessing your password. We also recommend that you change your password periodically. Your password must be at least 8 characters in length. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Login ID and Password. You may not provide these credentials to any third party. If you believe that they have been stolen or been made known to others, you must contact us immediately at [hello@getpocketbook.com](mailto:hello@getpocketbook.com), but in any event you should change your password immediately via the Service. We are not responsible if someone else accesses your account through Registration Information they have obtained from you or through a violation by you of this Privacy and Security Policy or the Pocketbook Terms of Use.

If you have a security related concern, please contact us at [hello@getpocketbook.com](mailto:hello@getpocketbook.com). We will work closely with you to ensure a rapid and personal response to your concerns.

WE POST UPDATES ON OUR WEBSITE WHENEVER THERE IS A CHANGE TO THIS POLICY

We update this Privacy & Security Policy periodically. The date last revised appears at the top of the Policy. Changes take effect immediately upon posting.

CONTACT US IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS

If you have questions, comments, concerns or feedback regarding this Privacy and Security Policy or any other privacy or security concern, send an email to [hello@getpocketbook.com](mailto:hello@getpocketbook.com).
