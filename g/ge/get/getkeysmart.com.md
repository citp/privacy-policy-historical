**WEB SITE USE INFORMATION**

Similar to other commercial websites, KeySmart utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" and web server logs to collect information about how our website is used. Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, pages viewed, time spent on our site, and the website visited just before and just after visiting our website.

**COOKIES**

A "cookie" is a small text file that a Web site can place on your computer's hard drive in order, for example, to collect information about your activities on the site or to make it easier to use certain site functions. The cookie transmits this information back to the Web site's computer. Many users do not know that "cookies" are being placed on their computers when they visit Web sites. If you want to know when this happens, or prevent it from happening, you can set your browser to warn you when a Web site attempts to place a "cookie" on your computer.

Cookies allow you to place an order on our website and allow us to enhance and personalize your online surfing and shopping experience. For example, we use cookies to:

  * Remember the items in your shopping basket
  * Recognize you when you return to our website
  * Analyze visitor behavior



**WEB SITE ANALYTICS**

We also use cookies to analyze how visitors, in the aggregate, use our website, in order to make our website as useful as possible for them. We do not use cookies to collect or store personally identifiable information. We may also use a third party web analytics service provider that uses cookies and web beacons to help us analyze how users use this website and the effectiveness of our marketing search terms.

In connection with alliances, partnerships or arrangements, we may also provide certain information to third parties if we have determined that the information will be used in a responsible manner by a responsible third party.
