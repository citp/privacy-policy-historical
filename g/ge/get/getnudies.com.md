# Privacy Policy

print this page.

When orders are placed through our online shops, we gather certain details. This page will provide you with information about our privacy policy.

## Personal information and data processing

To be able to offer you a good and personal service, EDC Internet requires some details about you. When you place an order with us, the following information is gathered:

**Personal information**

This is information you supply us with during the order process or registration process:

  * Name
  * Address
  * Postal code
  * Town
  * Country
  * E-mail address
  * Date of birth



This information is used to process your order and to get the parcel to you as soon as possible. Your e-mail address is necessary to send an order confirmation, so that you are always in possession of proof of your order. We also use your e-mail address to communicate with you about your order. Your e-mail address will not be used for marketing purposes.

**Payment details**

If you want to open an account and pay after you have received your order, your details will be checked and registered with Klarna in Amsterdam. Klarna deals with the completion of payments on account, owed to EDC Internet. Based on information supplied, Klarna will decide if you are eligible for this payment method.

When registering payment details we only record the total amount and your payment method (MasterCard, VISA, PayPal, Direct E-Banking, Account or a transfer from Bank or Giro). Of course, bank details are not saved and every payment option is secure.

**Traffic data**

Traffic data could be things such as registering an IP address*, enabling cookies**, registering click stream data and analysing how you navigated our website.

The traffic data are used to analyse our visitors' browsing patterns. We look at how the navigation is used, which pages are visited and which products are ordered, and use this information to improve the visibility, functionality and content of our site. 

_* An IP address is an Internet Protocol address that refers to a unique destination on the Internet. In some cases, this could mean that it can be traced back directly to the visitor's computer. This information is essential to send the pages via Internet to the correct computer._

_** A cookie is a collection of data, a registration file, that transfers a website to the hard disk of a computer and saves it there. A cookie does not identify the visitor, but it does identify the visitor's computer. Our website installs a cookie to link the products ordered by you to your computer (this way, your shopping basket is visible only to you)._
