Experian advertising cookie being placed on your computer.

Experian may use your data to help online advertisers to display advertisements that are more relevant to you when you visit this and/or other unrelated websites.

In order to do this, Experian will use your personal data, along with demographic and other data it already holds from other sources, to identify one or more advertising categories or segments into which you fall. These segments, which are represented by codes, will be passed to advertising networks that in turn will use these codes to display relevant advertising when you visit Web sites that use those networks. Your personal data will not be shared by Experian with any third party, including these advertising networks and the Web sites that display the advertisements.

To opt out of your data being used for this purpose, please click here <http://das.uk.experian.com/experianoptout>. This will direct you to Experian's opt-out centre. Opting out will not prevent online advertising being displayed to you; it will only prevent the use of your data in making these advertisements more relevant to you.

A cookie will be placed on your computer by Experian in order to identify Web site visitors that have agreed to the use of their data for targeted online advertising. This cookie is encrypted and only contains a code that identifies you to Experian. It is not used to track your online activity. If you opt out of allowing the use of your data for targeted online advertising Experian will add an opt-out flag to this cookie which will then be used to prevent your data being used. Alternatively you may wish to change your browser settings to prevent Experian cookies from being placed onto your computer.
