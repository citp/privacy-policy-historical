# GetUp! - Privacy policy

Privacy matters, and we are totally committed to ensuring that your participation in our important work protects your personal information. 

**What is personal information?**

Personal information is information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable whether the information or opinion is true or not, and whether the information is recorded in a material form or not. 

**What personal information we collect**

The types of information we collect and hold about you include your name, address, email address, telephone number and financial information. 

**Why we collect your personal information**

We collect personal information to allow us to send you opportunities to get up and participate in campaigns and to provide you with information about our organisation, projects and campaigns. 

We may also use your personal information for the purposes of our internal administrative, research, planning, marketing, campaigns and project development. 

We won't use or disclose your personal information for any secondary purpose, unless: 

  1. that secondary purpose is related to the primary purpose for which we collect that information and you would reasonably expect the disclosure in the circumstances; or
  2. you have given us your consent.



 **How we collect and hold information**

We collect and hold personal information you provide us through our website, over the phone, or by email. 

For example, when you send an email to us or give us information over the phone, we may retain this in order to respond to your inquiry. 

**How we make sure your personal information is protected**

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorised access to or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorised access to systems where we store personal information. 

Personal information is held only for as long as the personal information remains relevant to the purpose for which it was collected. 

**Unsolicited personal information**

We don't usually collect unsolicited personal information. 

Where we receive unsolicited personal information, we'll determine whether or not it would have been permissible to collect that personal information if it had been solicited. If we determine that collection would not have been permissible, to the extent permitted by law, we'll destroy or de-identify that personal information as soon as practicable. 

**Access and correction**

We'll take all reasonable steps to ensure any personal information we collect, use or disclose is up to date and accurate. 

If you believe personal information we hold about you is not up to date or accurate, you may ask us to correct it. You may ask us to provide you with details of the personal information we hold about you, and copies of that information. We will respond to your request and attempt to provide you with the data within 30 days of receipt of your request. 

If we provide you with copies of the information you have requested, we may charge you a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of providing you with that information. Please direct all request for access and correction to: 

Darren Loasby, Lvl 2, 104 Commonwealth St, Sydney NSW 2010, [privacy@getup.org.au](mailto:privacy@getup.org.au)

**Overseas disclosure**

We do not disclose personal information to any overseas entities. 

**Changes to this policy**

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time.
