        this information may include, without limitation, the Client's name and contact
        information, the Client's web site information (including without limitation
        name, URL), payment information, and user comments.</p>
        <p>We also may collect personally identifiable information if that information
        is provided by you in comments or feedback, if you post it on our classifieds,
        or if you contact us directly. Please do not post any personal information
        on the classifieds, forums, or other properties of Get Photography Jobs

        identifiable information about you which is made available by your browser,

        is necessary to administer the services we offer our Clients and End-Users or
        if we are required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure
        is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal
        process. We also may disclose information about users to law enforcement
        officers or others when we have a good faith belief that the disclosure is
        reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, respond to claims that any

        such unrelated uses.</p>

        <h2>Our Commitment to Data Security</h2>
        <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
        appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,

        also may be archived elsewhere. We make good faith efforts to store the
        information in a secure environment that is not publicly available, but we
        cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
        <p>Search engines not affiliated with Get Photography Jobs also may archive
        or otherwise make available content, including without limitation, postings
        and resumes, from Get Photography Jobs and we cannot guarantee the security
        in connection with any such unaffiliated entity in connection with
