# Privacy Policy

## OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY

**Updated and Effective Date: May 25, 2018**

ZFERRAL, INC dba Ambassador Software ("Ambassador") is committed to protecting your privacy and will make reasonable efforts to provide you a safe and secure user experience. We aim to make our Privacy Policy easy to read so you that you understand our online data collection practices and usage policies for www.getambassador.com (the “Site” and any “Services”). Please note that your use of the Site and any of our Services is subject to our Terms of Service which you may access at the bottom of our homepage. Our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service are integral to your use of our Site. Your continued use of the Site will constitute your agreement of and acceptance of the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy and Ambassador’s obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”) to data subjects residing in the European Union will supercede inconsistent terms in the Terms of Service.

## SCOPE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY

The Privacy Policy applies to all information you provide to Ambassador through the Site. If you have submitted information to any third parties through our Site and Service, as provided below, the privacy policies of those third parties will govern how your data will be used. Please check the privacy policies of any third party we link to before providing it with your personal information.

## WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We generally collect two types of information—personally identifiable information (“PII”) and non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”). PII is any information that can be used to specifically identify you as an individual. For example, you may submit and we may collect your name, email address, address, phone number, or similar information through the Site. Non-PII consists of information that does not specifically identify you. The following sections describe how we collect and use your PII and Non-PII.
