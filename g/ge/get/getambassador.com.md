# Customer Referral Tracking and Referral Rewards | Privacy Policy

In order to sign up for Ambassador we require a few specific pieces of information. This information is necessary for your experience at getAmbassador.com. This information also may also be used in your user profile. 

1\. Information Collected Upon Sign Up (All Registrations)  
During the Ambassador sign up process we require 3 pieces of information: 

a. **Name** \- Your name will not be visible to anybody logged into Ambassador, it is simply used as an identifier for your custom referral URL. 

b. **Password** \- When you first create an account at Ambassador, your password is automatically generated and sent to your email. It's encrypted and then securely and privately stored away in our database. This process ensures that you are the only individual with access to your password, and therefore your Ambassador account. Because it's encrypted, even we can't see your password. You can change your password at anytime by logging in and clicking on the “Settings” tab and the “Password” tab. 

c. **Your Email Address** \- We require that you submit a valid email address during the sign up process. This requirement is set in place for security purposes and to help us better communicate with you. Ambassador may contact you with important site updates, news, information about products and services associated with Ambassador, and notifications we deem necessary. We understand that your email address is personally identifiable information and therefore promise to protect this information to the best of our abilities.

This Log Data is collected for all Ambassador users and includes information such as your IP address, browser type, the search terms you use, and other similar pieces of information. We use Log Data to help measure site analytics and learn how our users interact with our website. Understanding the behavior of our users allows us to continuously improve Ambassador and deliver a more unique and beneficial user experience. 

Like many other websites, we may also store a cookie on your computer to collect additional information and statistics about your usage on getAmbassador.com. This cookie cannot be used to provide more information about your identity, unless you explicitly provide that information to us or your web browser automatically provides that information. This cookie allows Ambassador to recognize you on each visit and automatically signs you in without having to manually enter your username and password. 

3\. Data Use  
As our site continues to accumulate data, we may provide certain third parties such as, but not limited to, advertisers, media outlets, and research institutions with statistics and relevant data that we have collected. This data will not contain any personally identifiable information without first obtaining your authorization to include it, except as specifically described in this policy. 

We may also choose to utilize certain third parties to perform services including, but not limited to, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship management, marketing and advertising, and analytics.
