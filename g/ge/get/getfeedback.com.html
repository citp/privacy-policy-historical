This Privacy Policy applies to any data or information that we’ve collected, or collect, about and/or from you in connection with your use of our website, products, applications, or services provided by GetFeedback, Inc. under the GetFeedback brand (“<strong>Services</strong>”).</p>

<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>

<h2>SURVEY CREATORS</h2>

<h3>Information We Collect</h3>

<p>We collect information directly from you when you submit it in connection with our Services. Some of this information allows you to be personally identified (such as your name, email address, payment information, etc. which is provided in order to open an account) (“<strong>personal information</strong>”). Other information you provide is the content to be included as part of your survey (“<strong>survey content</strong>”).</p>

<p>We also collect usage information automatically when you use our Services. This includes what webpages you visit on our site, what you click on, as well as device information such as your IP address, operating system, and browser type and version. Like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers and those log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses. We may also access metadata and other information associated with files that you upload into our Services, such as images. If you arrive on our Site from an external source (such as a link on another website or in an email), we record information about the source that referred you to us.</p>

<p>The technologies we use for automatic information collection may include cookies and web beacons. A cookie is a small file placed on your computer or smartphone. We use cookies to record current session information, but do not require permanent cookies. You can choose to refuse or disable cookies from your browser or the settings on your smartphone but this may adversely impact your ability to use our Services.</p>

<p>Our Services may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages and for other related statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain content on
our Services and verifying system and server integrity).</p>

<p>In addition, certain third parties, such as analytics companies, may use automatic information collection technologies to collect information about you when you use our Services. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites, apps and other online services websites.</p>

<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>

<p>We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information, to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify who you are, including both identification and authentication.</li>
<li>Provide you the Services and any other information that you request from us.</li>
<li>Provide you with information about your account, including renewals and changes in Services or your account status.</li>
<li>Carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection.</li>
<li>Improve our Services.</li>
<li>Provide you with customer support.</li>
<li>Market to you other products and services that we offer (you may always opt out of these communications at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of every communication).</li>
<li>Fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it.</li>
</ul>

<p>The usage information we collect helps us to improve our Services and to deliver a better and more personalized experience by enabling us to better understand usage patterns. It also permits us to store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Services according to your individual interests.</p>

<h3>When Is Your Information Shared or Disclosed?</h3>

<p>We will not sell your survey content or personal information. Your survey content is owned by you and you choose with whom to share your surveys. We provide you a link to your survey and how you share this link is up to you. Anyone with access to the link will have access to your survey content until you delete the survey.</p>

<p>We limit our own access to your survey content. Only our administrators and customer/technical support managers have access to your survey content. Our staff will not access your survey content, grant access to third parties or otherwise disseminate your survey content. If there is a request for support, or if you hire our consulting services, then the person assigned to the request may log into your account for the purpose of troubleshooting and correcting the reported issue or performing the requested task.</p>

<p>In the following limited situations, we may disclose information that we collect or that you provide to us:</p>

<ul>
<li>To our contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business and who are obligated to keep personal information conﬁdential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.</li>
<li>In an aggregated or anonymized format where no individual can be identiﬁed or linked to any part of the information.</li>
<li>To comply with any court order, law or legal process, including responding to a governmental or regulatory request.</li>
<li>To enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us and for billing and collection.</li>
<li>To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, sale or transfer of some or all of GetFeedback, Inc.’s assets.</li>
<li>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.</li>
<li>With your consent.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessing, Changing, and Deleting Your Information</h3>

<p>You can review and change your personal information by visiting your account settings. We want to keep your information accurate and up to date. If your information changes (like a new email address or updated
payment information), then you’re responsible for notifying us of those changes.</p>

<p>Our Services require a username and password to log in. You must keep your username and password secure, and never disclose it to a third party. We won’t resend forgotten passwords. We’ll only help you to reset them.</p>

<p>We generally retain your data for as long as you have an account with us, or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.</p>

<p>You can delete your survey or survey content at any time. Deleting your content may not immediately remove the content you have published from our systems, because of caching, backups, or other references to your account.</p>

<h3>Data Storage and Security</h3>

<p>We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run our Services. Our servers are based in the United States and you consent to the transfer and processing of your personal data in the United States by GetFeedback, Inc. You retain all rights to your data. In certain circumstances survey content may be distributed outside of the United States, such as a content delivery network (CDN).</p>

<p>To protect your information, our credit card processing vendor uses the latest 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for secure transactions. Our vendor is certiﬁed as compliant with card association security initiatives, like the Visa Cardholder Information Security and Compliance (CISP), MasterCard® (SDP), and Discovery Information Security and Compliance (DISC).</p>

<p>Our Services require a username and password to log in. You must keep your username and password secure, and never disclose it to a third party.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, nobody is truly and completely safe from hackers. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee security. If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our system that materially affects you, we will notify you as soon as possible and report the action we took in response.</p>

<hr>

<h2>SURVEY TAKERS</h2>

<h3>Information We Collect About Survey Takers</h3>

<p>When someone responds to a survey created with our Services, we collect, on behalf and upon instructions of survey creators, survey responses as well as information relating to the survey taker and his/her use of our Services.</p>

<p>We collect usage information automatically when the survey taker uses our Services. This includes device information such as the survey taker’s IP address, operating system, and browser type. Like most websites today, our web servers keep log ﬁles that record data each time a device accesses those servers and those log ﬁles contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses. If the survey taker arrives on our website, we record information about the source that referred the survey taker to us.</p>

<p>The technologies we use for automatic information collection may include cookies. A cookie is a small ﬁle placed on the survey taker’s computer or smartphone. We use cookies to record current session information, but do not require permanent cookies. The survey taker can choose to refuse or disable cookies from their browser or the settings on their smartphone but this may adversely impact the survey taker’s ability to use our Services.</p>

<p>Our Services may contain small electronic ﬁles known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages and for other related statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain content on our Services and verifying system and server integrity).</p>

<p>In addition, certain third parties, such as analytics companies, may use automatic information collection technologies to collect information about survey takers when they use our Services. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites, apps and other online services websites.</p>

<h3>How We Use Survey Taker Information</h3>

<p>Survey responses are owned and managed by the survey creator. To understand how survey creators will use survey responses, survey takers would need to contact the survey creator directly.</p>

<p>We only use information that we collect about or from survey takers, including any personal information, to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Improve our Services and resolve technical issues.</li>
<li>Provide customer support.</li>
<li>Fulﬁll any other purpose for which you provide it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When Survey Taker Information is Shared or Disclosed</h3>

<p>Survey responses are disclosed to the survey creator and, as mentioned above, such responses are owned and managed by the survey creator.</p>

<p>We host surveys but the survey creators control how surveys are sent out and what is done with the information received. Survey takers should contact the survey creator to understand what will be done with survey responses and whether responses are received anonymously or whether the survey was sent out in a manner that allows the survey creator to link the response with an email address.</p>

<p>In the following limited situations, we may disclose survey taker information to someone other than the survey creator:</p>

<ul>
<li>To our contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business and who are obligated to keep personal information conﬁdential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.</li>
<li>In an aggregated or anonymized format where no individual can be identiﬁed or linked to any part of the information.</li>
<li>To comply with any court order, law or legal process, including responding to a governmental or regulatory request.</li>
<li>To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, sale or transfer of some or all of GetFeedback, Inc.’s assets.</li>
<li>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.</li>
<li>With your consent</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessing, Changing, and Deleting Survey Taker Information</h3>

<p>A survey taker would need to contact the survey creator to access, update, or delete responses or personal information submitted through our Services.</p>
