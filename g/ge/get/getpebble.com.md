# Fitbit Legal - Privacy

This is important. We want to highlight for you some key parts of our privacy policy in one quick summary.

## We pledge to respect your privacy. 

We believe in being transparent about our data practices. We work hard to keep your data safe. We give you settings to control how your information is shared, and we only ask you for your information so we can provide you with great products.

Our business is to sell products you believe in. We never sell your personal data. We make data work for you so you can live a healthier, more active life.

If you want more information, you can peruse our [full privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/en-ca/legal/privacy-policy). And, if you have questions about this policy, or about our use of your information, please contact us at [privacy@fitbit.com](mailto:privacy@fitbit.com).

## [Information we collect](https://web.archive.org/en-ca/legal/privacy-policy#collect)

From motivational sayings to fitness tips, we think it’s important to collect things that make us better. That’s why we collect data when you use our products and services—because that information helps us get to know you and create a better experience for you. And you deserve the best.

### Device Info

We get your info to give you info. When you use a Fitbit device, we collect data to estimate a variety of metrics like the number of steps you take, your distance traveled, calories burned, weight, heart rate, sleep stages, active minutes, and location. So, then we can show you your stats and progress.

### Your IP Address

When you visit our site, we collect your IP address and can use it to make sure you’re getting the content that’s relevant to you and your location.

### Cookies

Our policy on cookies—in life, and online—is that we like them a lot, in moderation. When you visit our site, we use cookies and other technologies to improve what we do and how we do it. Get more details in our [Cookie Use](https://web.archive.org/en-ca/legal/cookie-policy) statement.

### Friends

You can invite friends to join you on Fitbit by providing us with their email. We’ll use the contact info you provide to send them an invitation to join you and promise not to add them to a marketing list.

### GPS and Location

Some features, like mapping a run or activity, use precise location data. This includes GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs. But we’ll only collect this type of data if you grant us access to your location.

### Account Info

Everything’s better when it’s tailored to you. That’s why we require info like your height, weight, gender, and age when you create a Fitbit account. It helps us personalize your daily exercise and activity stats like the number of calories you burned and the distance you traveled.

### Your Contact Info

We’ve tried, but we just can’t get the psychic thing down. So, when you contact us for help, we collect your name, contact information, and message to make sure we get you the answers you need.

### Purchase Details

When you buy from our online store, we keep your shipping address so we can fulfill your order. And because you’d be bummed if your new tracker went to someone else. But we don’t store your payment information. And if you make payments using a Fitbit device that supports them, we don’t store your transaction history.

### Linked Account Info

You can connect your Fitbit account to your accounts on other services, like Facebook or Google. If you do, the other service may send us info like your name, profile picture, age range, language, email address, and friend list. You can stop sharing this info with us by removing our access to the other service.

We use your information to be more accurate about your daily exercise and activity stats and to personalize the services to help you reach your exercise and activity goals.

## [How information is shared](https://web.archive.org/en-ca/legal/privacy-policy#what-data)

We don’t sell personal data like your name, email address, or any information that could reasonably be used to identify you. And we only share it when you tell us to, to companies that provide services to us, and for legal reasons or to prevent harm.

* * *

### Non-Personal Information

We may share non-personal information that is aggregated or de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual. For example, in public reports about exercise and activity, to partners under agreement with us, or as part of the community benchmarking information we provide to users of our subscription services.

### Personal Information

We do not share your personal information except in the [limited circumstances](https://web.archive.org/en-ca/legal/privacy-policy#what-data) described in our privacy policy like when you agree or direct us to share the information, or when the information is shared for external processing, for legal reasons, or to prevent harm.
