          <span></span>
          Getyourschool.com.com believes that all the information that we gather about you should be used solely to assist you in locating, comparing, purchasing, registering or inquiring about courses, degrees, professional training or related services.

          <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
          <p>Getyourschool.com will not disclose your personally identifiable information except as described below:
          <span></span>
          If you use our site or if you post on our blogs, forums, message boards, or chat rooms, some personally identifiable information may be seen by other members or users. This includes, but is not limited to, the poster's name, date of post, comments, IP address, survey responses, and other information. This information may also be transferred to any outside entity, including the press or other media that visits our site.
          <span></span>
          
We use the information we automatically collect (such as contact information, IP address and basic browser and system details) to help us optimize our sites and the services we currently offer on the sites and may offer in the future. We also collect personal information and share it with trusted third parties to analyze and provide us with feedback, suggestions and strategies to improve our business processes and the services we provide. If you elect to provide us with personally identifiable information, such information may also be used for marketing purposes, and may result in follow-up communications from Getyourschool.com, our affiliated properties and services, and institutions of higher education about opportunities, programs and other services that are related to education. In addition, from time to time, we may share personally identifiable information (such as e-mail addresses and other contact information such as name, email address and phone number) with carefully selected third parties, so they may offer goods and services that we believe may be of interest to our customers.
<span></span>
Getyourschool.com shares your personal information with the educational institutions you selected and, if you use one of our matching services, those institutions which we have matched your profile so that these institutions may contact you with information about their programs. Use of your personal information by these educational institutions is not governed by this Privacy Policy. For further information on such institution’s use of your information, please visit the applicable privacy policy of such institution. Educational institutions have separate policy practices for which Getyourschool.com has no responsibility or liability.
<span></span>
If you submit information to an advertiser or other third party that is made available on or through Getyourschool.com, the information obtained during your visit to that advertiser’s website, and the information you give to the advertiser will be governed by the advertiser’s privacy policy. For further information on such advertiser’s use of your information, please visit the applicable privacy policy of such advertisers. Advertisers made available on this site have separate policy practices for which Getyourschool.com has no responsibility or liability.
<span></span>
We may disclose account information where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Getyourschool.com's policies as specified in the Privacy Policy or relevant User Agreement, may be violating state or federal law, or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Getyourschool.com's rights or property, other users of the Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Getyourschool.com may disclose or access account information when we believe that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain and improve our services.
<span></span>
Additionally, Getyourschool.com uses your information to provide you with a customized browsing experience. We also may use your personal information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, respond to your inquiries, detect and protect against error, fraud, or other criminal activity, enforce our User Agreement, and for any other purposes that Getyourschool.com deems appropriate.
<span></span>
We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they unlawfully collect from the Site. We will try to protect your privacy, however, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
</p>
<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>In order to request information from many of our educational partners, a user must first complete a form with contact information. These forms vary across partners but can include name, email address, mailing address, day and night phone number, education level, and income range. Getyourschool.com.com and our partners use this information to contact users about services, courses, or training for which they have requested information or expressed interest. We do not sell or make available this information for any other reason. In rare cases, the receiving partner may already have the users information on file. When this occurs, the users information may be sent to a similar education provider that has the degree program, the course or the training that suits the users needs. Users may also choose to make the information provided to our educational partners available to other third parties. Please refer to the partner's privacy statement in these instances.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Cookie data may be linked to personally identifiable information for data analysis and quality assurance purposes, but individual cookie data is never shared with or sold to any third parties. We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies with a life up to 60 days. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time.
<span></span>
Getyourschool.com.com uses cookies to track which areas of our site are most visited for the purpose of better optimization and user experience. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. See the "Profile" section.
<span></span>
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Getyourschool.com.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
<span></span>
We use clear gifs in our email communications. We use clear gifs within our email communications so that we may monitor how many emails have been opened.</p>
<h3>Profile</h3>
<p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences. This information is not tied to the users personally identifiable information. We do not share your profile with other third parties.</p>
<h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
<h3>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h3>
<p>We and our third party advertising companies employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information.
<span></span>
Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same website or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited "www.companyX.com," which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the website or advertising company would match the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information would then be given to the advertising company or website.
