        <ul>
            <li>(a)	We consider these Terms and the Order to set out the whole agreement between you and us for the supply of the Services. These Terms only apply to our contracts with consumers.</li>
            <li>(b)	Please check that the details in these Terms and on the Order are complete and accurate before you commit yourself to the contract. If you think that there is a mistake, please make sure that you ask us to confirm any changes in writing, as we only accept responsibility for statements and representations made in writing by our authorised employees and agents.</li>
            <li>(c)	Please ensure that you read and understand these Terms before you submit the Order, because you will be bound by the Terms once a contract comes into existence between us, in accordance with clause 1.4.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>1.1	Any samples, drawings, descriptions or advertising we issue, and any descriptions or illustrations contained in our catalogues or brochures, are issued or published solely to provide you with an approximate idea of the Services they describe. They do not form part of the contract between you and us or any other contract between you and us for the supply of the Services.</li>
        <li>1.2	If any of these Terms are inconsistent with any term of the Order, the Order shall prevail.</li>
        <li>1.3	The Order is an offer by you to enter into a binding contract with us, which we are free to accept or decline at our absolute discretion.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>1.4.1	we issue you with written acceptance of an Order with your email invite; or</li>
            <li>1.4.2	we notify you that we are able to provide the Services,	whichever is the earlier, at which point a contract shall come into existence between us.</li>
        </ul>

    <li>Bulletin boards.</li>
    <li>Blog Postings</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(interactive services)</strong>.</p>
<p>Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical).</p>
<p>We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on our site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.</p>
<p>The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not foolproof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.</p>
<p>Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.</p>
