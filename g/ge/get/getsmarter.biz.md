### POPI – PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ACT

WHAT IS POPI? 

THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ACT EXPLAINED

In simple terms, the purpose of the PoPI Act is to ensure that all South African institutions conduct themselves in a responsible manner when collecting, processing, storing and sharing another entity's personal information by holding them accountable should they abuse or compromise personal information in any way. The PoPI legislation aims to bestow upon the owner of the personal information certain rights of protection and the ability to exercise control over:

  * when and how you choose to share your information (requires your consent)
  * the type and extent of information you choose to share (must be collected for valid reasons)
  * transparency and accountability on how your data will be used (limited to the purpose) and notification if/when the data is compromised
  * providing you with access to your own information as well as the right to have your data removed and/or destroyed should you so wish
  * who has access to your information, i.e. there must be adequate measures and controls in place to track access and prevent unauthorised people, even within the same company, from accessing your information
  * how and where your information is stored (there must be adequate measures and controls in place to safeguard your information to protect it from theft, or being compromised)
  * the integrity and continued accuracy of your information (i.e. your information must be captured correctly and once collected, the institution is responsible to maintain it)



Examples of Personal Information for an individual could include:

  * Identity and/or passport number
  * Date of birth and age
  * Phone number/s (including mobile phone number)
  * Email address/es



The right to protection of "personal information" is applicable not only to a natural person (i.e. an individual) but also to any legal entity, including companies and communities or other legally recognised organisations. All of these entities are considered to be "data subjects" and are afforded the same right to protection of their information.

POPI: STATUS AS AT JUNE 2016

Certain sections of the POPI Act have already been implemented (under proclamation No. R. 25, 2014), but the majority of POPI (and specifically the sections that are more likely to lead to compliance requirements) will only commence at a later, as yet unknown date. This date is yet to be proclaimed by the President.

POPI: SECTIONS OF THE ACT WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED.

DEFINITIONS (SECTION 1):

This section does not create any laws itself, but is necessary for other sections.

THE INFORMATION REGULATOR (PART A OF CHAPTER 5):

Part A deals with the establishment, staffing, powers and meetings of the Information Regulator.

REGULATIONS (SECTION 112):

The Minister and the Information Regulator are now able to create regulations.

PROCEDURE FOR CREATION OF REGULATIONS (SECTION 113):

The procedure for creating regulations is now in place. There are no regulations as yet, and there are no expectations for the creation of any draft regulations before July 2016.

POPI: NEXT STEPS

The President is to appoint the Information Regulator. The start date for the implementation of POPI in earnest is currently anticipated to be towards the end of 2016. There will follow a one-year grace period that could be used by the Information Regulator to finalise the implementation. Currently it is anticipated that POPI compliance will only be enforced from the end of 2017.
