# Websites, Communications & Cookies Privacy Notice — Mozilla

June 1, 2015

We care about your privacy. When Mozilla (that's us) collects information about you, our [Mozilla Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy/) describes how we handle that information.

This privacy notice applies to Mozilla operated websites and mobile apps, which include the domains mozillians.org, mozilla.org, firefox.com, and webmaker.org, among others. This includes, for example, bugzilla.mozilla.org, reps.mozilla.org, careers.mozilla.org, developers.mozilla.org, support.mozilla.org, addons.mozilla.org, and wiki.mozilla.org.

## Things you should know

We may receive personal information from you based on your interaction with us on social media platforms; if you submit a job, intern or fellow application; if you volunteer as a Mozilla community member; if you submit user feedback or a request to us; if you sign-up for an account; or if you engage with a product or policy campaign. Learn More

  * **Social Media** : If you engage with our social media accounts, such as Twitter and Facebook, we may receive personal information about you. If you use these networks, their privacy policies apply, and you are encouraged to read them.

  * **Job, Intern & Fellow Applicants**: Applicants for employment, internship or fellowship opportunities with Mozilla are required to give us a name, street address, telephone number, email address, and resume. We use this information to process and evaluate applications and to communicate with applicants about opportunities. We use a third party vendor to assist us with employment applications. For more information on our data practices with third party vendors, see our [Mozilla Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy/).

  * **Contributors** : Volunteering for Mozilla as a community contributor may require Mozilla and others to communicate with you at the email address that you provide in connection to your contribution and to recognize your efforts. If you contribute to Bugzilla, Mozilla Reps, or our code base, then your email address and possibly your name will be publicly available to all internet users. If you create a profile at Mozillians.org, it will be accessible to Mozilla employees and Mozilla contributors. You can edit your profile data at [Profile Settings](https://mozillians.org/user/edit). We sometimes use contributor information from sources (such as Bugzilla) in dashboards to visually share aggregated data on the Mozilla community. An example is <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Dashboards>. If possible, we try to minimize contact information that is publicly displayed.

  * **User Feedback** : You can provide feedback to us on our products and services on webpages like [input.mozilla.org](https://input.mozilla.org/), through an in-product experience, or through channels such as email, Bugzilla, IRC, a social media account, our Get Involved page, or through a group like Student Ambassadors. Please minimize the personal information you choose to share on these forums because your comments may be accessible to the public.

  * **Accounts** : Some websites, for example Marketplace, AMO, MDN, and Webmaker, require account creation to submit developer content; submit user reviews or comments; or install certain types of apps. You may periodically receive emails in connection with your account. 

  * **Product & Policy Campaigns**: Some of our webpages host product or policy campaigns. For example, you can request a link by email or SMS to install Firefox on your mobile device or petition your legislators on internet issues. We use third parties to manage these campaigns and handle any data that you choose to submit.  





* * *

We may use cookies, clear GIFs, third party web analytics, device information, and IP addresses for functionality and to better understand user interaction with our products, services, and communications. Learn More

* * *

You can control individual cookie preferences, indicate your cookie preferences to others, select text only emails, and opt-out of web analytics and optimization tools. Learn More

  * **Cookie History** : You can accept or decline individual cookies in your Firefox preferences in the Tools/Options/Privacy history section. Note that certain features of our products and services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

  * **Do Not Track** : Mozilla does not track users across third party websites to provide targeted advertising. You can enable Do Not Track in Firefox in the Tools/Options/Privacy section on Tracking. This lets you indicate a preference to third party websites about the way your information is collected and used online.

  * **Email** : Our marketing communications are optional to receive and you can unsubscribe from the footer of the email or by updating your [Mozilla email preferences](https://web.archive.org/newsletter/recovery/). You can disable the functionality of clear GIFs by viewing emails from us in “text only” format.

  * **Analytics & Optimization**: If you do not want data about your visits to Mozilla websites to be collected by Google Analytics, you can install the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). The add-on keeps your visits anonymous and prohibits data transmission to Google Analytics. If you do not want data about your visits to Mozilla websites to be collected by Optimizely, you can [opt-out on www.mozilla.org](https://web.archive.org/?optimizely_opt_out=true) or visit [Optimizely's opt-out website](https://www.optimizely.com/opt_out) for more information. Some Mozilla.org pages also use clear GIFs to understand the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. You can opt-out by going to the “Your Choices” section of [Flashtalking’s Privacy Policy](http://www.flashtalking.com/us/privacypolicy) and selecting “Click here to opt-out”.

  * **Social Media** : The social sharing buttons on Mozilla websites are designed not to share data with the social media provider until you specifically click the button.




* * *

Some Mozilla websites allow you to make purchases (such as apps or gear) or make a donation. These transactions are processed by third parties, and not Mozilla. Learn More

  * **Payment Processing** : Mozilla does not receive any financial information, which is transmitted from you to our third party vendors for processing. The name of the third party will be displayed at the time of the transaction. For more information on our data practices with third party vendors, see our [Mozilla Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy/).
