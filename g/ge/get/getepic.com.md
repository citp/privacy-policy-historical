Although we collect personally identifiable information from parents, we do not collect such information from your child. Any child under the age of 13 using the service must do so with permission from a parent. All full names, email addresses, and credit card billing information must be from a parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect personal information (including full name, email address, telephone number or home address) from children under the age of 13 in our app. We encourage parents to take an active role in their children's activities and interests on the iPad. When registering your child with the service, Epic! may ask a series of general questions including your child's age, interests and gender. This information is used to customize content to your child's age and interests. We do not use or disclose this information for any other purposes except to provide you with quality service.
