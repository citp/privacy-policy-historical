## Privacy Policy

This policy describes Getaroom’s practices regarding personally identifiable information and data (“personal information”). This policy applies to our websites, applications, email and text messages, and social media accounts (the “Platforms”). When you use the Platforms, you agree to the terms in this policy.

    If you book a travel product via the Platforms, we may need additional information from you. This information can include your name (and traveler’s if different) name, age, email address, telephone number, credit card information, and billing address. You can also choose to store personal information in your user account for future bookings.
Account information
    If you choose to register, we will collect your name, email address, password, and other preference information you provide us. 
Consumer support
    If you choose to contact our consumer support services we will collect any inquires, complaint or other information that you may submit to our support team.
Promotional information
    If you choose to participate in a sweepstake, contests or similar campaign we will collect any information you provide in relation to such activity such as photos, images, captions or other content, in accordance with the terms provided at that time.

When you give us personal information, you are telling us that the information is true, accurate, complete and current. You are also telling us that you have the authorization to provide it to us.

#### How we collect your Personal Information

Personal information you give to us
    We collect your personal information directly from you. For example, when you provide us your personal information when you register or book travel, contact our customer support or participate in a contest or sweepstake.

We also collect your personal information passively. For example, we collect information about you over time and across different Web sites when you visit this Platform. We also use tracking tools like cookies and beacons.

Platform features may make use of your device attributes and settings that will allow us to determine your physical location. Such technologies may include IP address mapping, WiFi, GPS signals, cell tower positioning or other technologies. We use this information to enhance and personalize your experience and provide you with offers and services that may be of interest to you. For example, we may help you find your closest hotel or send you messages that may be of interest to you based on your current location. Getaroom does not have control over your device settings, but we do recommend enabling location services on your device so you can take advantage of the location based features and functionality offered.

Personal information we receive from third parties
    We collect your personal information from third parties. In addition, we also integrate third party software that collects information about users for security reasons.

#### How we store and protect your Personal Information

Our servers and data centers are located in the U.S, and our service providers may be located there and in other countries. By providing us personal information, you agree that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in these countries. These countries may have different and/or less stringent privacy/data protection and data security rules than those of your own country. As a result, your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those countries according to laws in those countries. Subject to the applicable laws in such other countries, we will provide the necessary safeguards to maintain protections of your personal information, e.g. by obtaining from the data recipients contractual commitments based on the EU model clauses.

Getaroom has a security program intended to keep the personal information stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access and misuse. Our systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling technologies and firewalls constructed to industry standards. We also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that protects the data you send over the Internet. Personal information may only be accessed by persons within our organizations, or our third parties to carry out the uses indicated in this Privacy Policy.

If you are the parent/legal guardian of a minor who has given us personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.

#### Changes to the Privacy Policy

## Cookies and other tracking tools

#### Getaroom uses tracking tools such as cookies

We (or our suppliers) use several common tracking tools. We use these tools to collect usage and demographic information about you over time and across different Web sites when you use our Platforms. We also have third parties (e.g. advertisers) that collect personal information this way. Tools we use may include browser cookies. Your browser will store these cookies on your computer in a small file.

We and our advertising partners may also use web beacons (single pixel GIF images). These web beacons are placed in the code of a Web page or an email newsletter. When you access a partner site within our mobile applications, we may track your activity on that site.

By using the Platforms, you give us your free, unambiguous and informed consent to the use of any of the cookies and tracking tools mentioned in this policy.

#### Getaroom uses tracking tools for following purposes

  1. To track new visitors to the Platforms.
  2. To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor. This includes saving and remembering any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting the Platforms, such as language.

  5. To work with online advertising companies to display targeted advertising on our Platforms and third party platforms that you visit. This targeting may be based on information you submit on our Platforms or third party platforms. This targeting may also be based on your activities or behaviors on our Platforms or those of third parties. We may also obtain information about your browsing history from our business partners. To learn more about targeted advertising and how you can accept or refuse (opt-out of) this type of advertisements, we recommend that you visit [www.aboutads.info/choices](https://web.archive.org/web/20190510162754id_/https%3A//www.getaroom.com/www.aboutads.info/choices), [www.youronlinechoices.eu](https://web.archive.org/web/20190510162754id_/https%3A//www.getaroom.com/www.youronlinechoices.eu) or <http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices>.

#### How you can control tracking tools and opt-out of online behavioral advertising

Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How to do this varies from browser to browser. You should view the Help menu on the browser you use for further information. Your opt out choice is stored in opt out cookies only in that browser, so you should separately set your preferences for other browsers, computers, or devices you may use. If your browser blocks cookies, your opt out preferences may not be effective. Deleting browser cookies can remove your opt out preferences, so you should visit this page periodically to review your preferences. If you block or delete cookies or opt out of online behavioral advertising, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop.

Please also note that opting out of a third party cookie does not mean that you will no longer receive or be subject to online advertising or marketing. It means that the third party service from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and online behavioral.

We may also use Google Analytics to collect demographic and interest data about you (such as age, gender, and interests), including through Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. We may use the information collected about you through Google Analytics for Google services such as Remarketing with Google Analytics and Google Display Network Impression Reporting. You can find out more about Google Analytics and how to opt-out by going here. Choices you make are browser and device specific. Some aspects of our site use cookies to function. You may not be able to use these features if you set your device to block cookies.

#### How Getaroom responds to “Do Not Track” signals

Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.
