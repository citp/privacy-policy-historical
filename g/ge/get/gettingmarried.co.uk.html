<h1><strong>GettingMarried.co.uk Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
<p>Last updated: 1 December 2009.</p>
<p>At GettingMarried.co.uk, we recognise that privacy is important. The following Privacy Policy describes the usage of information that is collected on the site, by both you and visitors to your site. If you have any questions or queries about this Privacy Policy, please do not hesitate to contact us via our website at <a href="http://www.gettingmarried.co.uk/contactus.php">http://www.gettingmarried.co.uk/contactus.php</a>.</p>
<h2><br>
  Information
  Collection &amp; Use</h2>
<p><b>Registration</b><br>
In order to
  use this Web site, you must first complete the registration form and create a
  user name and password.� During
  registration you are required to give contact information (such as name and
  email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on
our site in which you have expressed interest.� </p>
<p>You have the
  option to provide demographic information age and gender to us; we encourage
  you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalised
experience on our site.� </p>
<p><a href="http://www.incubate.co.uk">Incubate</a> is the sole owner of the information collected on GettingMarried.co.uk.
  Incubate collects personally identifiable information from our users at several
different points on our Web site:</p>
<strong><br>Creating your wedding website<br>
</strong>While creating your wedding website, you will be required to enter
  various pieces of information, including both personal details and about your wedding day. We use
  this information to create your website. You have complete control over what
  information appears on your public wedding site, and no information will ever
be released to any third party.
<p><strong>  Interacting with your wedding website<br>
  </strong>When your guests interact with your wedding website, they may enter
  information about themselves (i.e. the lift sharing facility, RSVPing etc).
  This information is stored securely in our databases and is only accessible to
  the couple who own the site. This information will never be released to any
  third party.<strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sending Invitations to Friends<br>
</strong>If you
  choose to send an invitation to a friend, we will ask you for your friend�s email
  address.� We will automatically send your
  friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.� Incubate stores this information for the sole
  purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral
programme.</p>
<p>Your friend
  may contact us at <a href="http://www.gettingmarried.co.uk/contactus.php">http://www.gettingmarried.co.uk/contactus.php</a> �to request that we remove this
information from our database.</p>
<p><strong>Financial details<br>
</strong>When purchasing a GettingMarried.co.uk DVD, GettingMarried.co.uk uses PayPal as its gateway to process credit/debit card payments. GettingMarried.co.uk does NOT store (and does not intend to store) your credit/debit card information.</p>

<h1><br>
Uses of Information</h1>
<p>The site uses information that you provide to create the designs on the
  site, and provide starting data for the site�s features. For example, if you
  provide a postcode of the wedding venue, the site will use this information to automatically
generate maps and travelling instructions.</p>
<p>All information sharing is performed with the explicit consent of the user.
  For example, if a guest who is driving to the reception provides information
  about him/herself in the lift sharing section, this information will be stored
  on the GettingMarried.co.uk servers. However, this information will only be
  released to a passenger, if the driver explicitly approves the information
  sharing to proceed (via a link to his email inbox). If the driver does not
approve of the passenger, no information sharing will occur.</p>
<h2><b><br>
  Communications
from the Site</b></h2>
<strong>Special Offers and Updates<br>
</strong>We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special
  deals and promotions. You can sign up for these emails from us on our
  registration page. You will not receive these emails unless you have registered
for them.
<p>Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive
  these types of communications.� Please
see the �Choice and Opt-out.� </p>
<p><strong>Newsletters<br>
  </strong>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletters, we will use your name and
  email address to send the newsletter to you.� Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to
  unsubscribe.� Please see the �Choice and
Opt-out� section.</p>
<p><strong>Service-related Announcements<br>
</strong>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare
  occasions when it is necessary to do so.� For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance,
we might send you an email.� </p>
<p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not
  promotional in nature.� If you do not
wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. </p>
<h2><br>
Customer Service</h2>
<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we
  will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.� We will also communicate with you in response
  to your enquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your
  account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with
  your wishes.</p>
<h2><br>
  Profile </h2>
<p>We store information that we collect through
  cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third party sources to create a
  �profile� of your preferences.� We tie your
  personally identifiable information to information in the profile, in order to
  provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of
  the site for you.� </p>
<p>We do not share your profile with other third
  parties.</p>
<h1><br>
Information Sharing and Disclosure</h1>
<p><strong>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</strong><br>
  We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our
  partners and advertisers.� This
information does not identify individual users.</p>
<p>We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable
  information.� </p>
<p><strong>Personally identifiable information:<br>
</strong>We DO NOT
Share Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties </p>
<p><strong>Service Providers<br>
</strong>We use the services of Google Inc to provide mapping and geolocational
  services on our site.� When you sign up
  for your site, we will share co-ordinates of your wedding reception and
  ceremony with Google, as necessary for the third party to provide that service.
  Google does not have access to any personally identifiable information � it purely
produces a map based upon input co-ordinates.</p>
<h2><br>
Legal Disclaimer</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose
  your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe
  that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a
  judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site</p>
  <h2>Choice/Opt-out</h2>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional
    communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions
  included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us via <a href="http://www.gettingmarried.co.uk/contactus.php">http://www.gettingmarried.co.uk/contactus.php</a>.</p>
  <h1><br>
    Log
  Files</h1>
  <p>As is true
    of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in
    log files.� This information includes
    internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider
    (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream
  data.� </p>
  <p>We use this
    information, which does not identify individual users, to analyse trends, to
    administer the site, to track users� movements around the site and to gather
  demographic information about our user base as a whole.� </p>
  <p>We do link
  this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>
  <h2><br>
  Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user�s computer for
  record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the
  information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you
  submit while on our site.</p>
<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.� We use session cookies to make it easier for
  you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you
  browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period
  of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in
  your Internet browser�s �help� file.</p>
<p>We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don�t have to
  enter it more than once.� Persistent
  cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to
  enhance the experience on our site.� </p>
<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to
  use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.</p>
<p>This privacy statement covers the
  use of cookies by GettingMarried.co.uk only and does not cover the use of
  cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<h2><br>
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h2>
<p>If you came
  to our site via a Google advertising campaign, we employ a software technology called clear gifs
  (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site
  by informing us which advertisements are effective.� Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique
  identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online
  movements of Web users.� In contrast to
  cookies, which are stored on a user�s computer hard drive, clear gifs are
  embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end
  of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our
  customers� personally identifiable information. </p>
<p>To learn
  more about Google�s use of clear gifs, please go to <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html</a></p>
<p>We use clear
  gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by
  recipients.� This allows us to gauge the
  effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing
  campaigns.� If you would like to opt-out
  of these emails, please see �Choice and Opt-out.� </p>
<h2><strong>Links
  to Other Sites</strong></h2>
<p>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or
  controlled by Incubate. Please be aware that we, Incubate, are not responsible
  for the privacy practices of such other sites.� 
</p>
<p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the
  privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally
  identifiable information.� </p>
<p>This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web
  site. </p>
<h2><strong><br>
  Bulletin Boards/Chat Rooms</strong></h2>
<p>If you use the bulletin board or chat room on this site, you should be
  aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be
  read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to
  send you unsolicited messages.� We are
  not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to
  submit in these forums.<i></i></p>
<h1><br>
    <strong>Access
  to Personally Identifiable Information</strong></h1>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer
  desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making
  the change on our member information page, or by emailing our Customer Support
  at <a href="http://www.gettingmarried.co.uk/contactus.php">http://www.gettingmarried.co.uk/contactus.php</a>.</p>
<h3><strong><br>
  Security
  </strong></h3>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to
  protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and
  once we receive it.� No method of
  transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
  secure, however.� Therefore, while we
  strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal
information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about security on our
Web site, you can send email us via <a href="http://www.gettingmarried.co.uk/contactus.php">http://www.gettingmarried.co.uk/contactus.php</a></p>
<h3><br>
Business Transitions</h3>
<p>In the event
  Incubate goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by
  another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally
  identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.� You will be notified via email and a prominent
  notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control
of your personal information.</p>
<h3><br>
  Changes in this Privacy Statement  </h3>
<p>If we decide
  to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy
  statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are
  aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
circumstances, if any, we disclose it.� </p>
<p>We reserve
  the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it
  frequently.� If we make material changes
  to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on
our home page.</p>
