# Privacy Policy - FreeDVDCover.Com

We here at GetDVDCovers.Com respect your privacy. Your privacy is of paramount importance to us and we are always committed to safeguarding it.

GetDVDCovers.Com does not collect any personal information about you such as your name, address, phone number or email ID without your knowledge. When you provide your email ID while contacting us using [contact page](http://www.freedvdcover.com/contact/), we never share it with anyone. We only use it to respond to your email.

We use cookies to personalize content and ads, to provide social media features and to analyse our traffic. We also share information about your use of our site with our social media, advertising and analytics partners.

We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous – so we don’t know who you are; just that  _somebody  _visited our site.

The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better.

You can learn more about [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html "Google Analytics' privacy policy") or [opt out if you wish](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout "How to opt out of google analytics").

Since we use third-party advertisements on this website such as [Google Adsense](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/), these ad companies can use cookies or web beacons to collect some information about your visit to serve ads of interest to you.

You can use [Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/?hl=en) to manage the Google ads you see and opt out of interest-based ads. Even if you opt out of interest-based ads, you may still see ads based on factors such as your general location derived from your IP address, your browser type and recent, previous searches related to your current search.

You can also manage many companies’ cookies used for online advertising at the US-based [aboutads.info choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) page or the EU-based [Your Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices).

Finally, you can [manage cookies in your web browser](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/managing/).

## Facebook, Twitter and other social networks

These services provide social buttons and similar features which we use on our website – such as the “Like” and “Tweet” buttons.

To do so we embed code that they provide and we do not control ourselves. To function their buttons generally know if you’re logged in; for example Facebook use this to say “x of your friends like this”. We do not have any access to that information, nor can we control how those networks use it.

Social networks therefore  _could  _know that you’re viewing this website, if you use their services (that isn’t to say they do, but their policies may change). As our website is remarkably inoffensive we imagine this is not a concern for most users.

Please feel free to [contact us](http://www.freedvdcover.com/contact/) for any questions or concerns regarding your privacy.
