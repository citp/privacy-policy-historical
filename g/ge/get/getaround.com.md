### Usage Information We Collect

#### Data Gathered from In-Vehicle Hardware

The Getaround Connect™ installed in each Getaround car allows us to gather information about your vehicle use, including time of use, location and movements, speed of travel, distance traveled, and other aspects of your vehicle use. We use this information to (i) provide you with the Service, (ii) understand your driving and use habits over time and potentially provide you with related benefits, such as better insurance rates or other perks for safe driving, (iii) record vehicle movements and driver behavior in case of an accident or theft, and (iv) aggregate your data with other drivers' data and better understand how people use our Service and how we can make it even better for you in the future. We may share this information with third parties as described below.

‍

#### Location Tracking

The location of all Getaround cars you use is tracked by GPS (or equivalent), cellular, WiFi, Bluetooth, or similar technologies. Location information is tracked both on your Getaround-enabled smart phone and by the vehicle's Getaround Connect **™**. Location information is shared in limited ways. As a car Owner, you can control when and where other Getaround Users can see the location of your car while parked. If you are renting a car, the Owner of the car will be able to see the location of the rented car and will be able to see the car’s location and movements in real time. 

We monitor the location of all cars to provide our Service, to prevent theft, and to allow us to locate you in case of accident, emergency, lock-out, etc. We may maintain location data in order to aggregate trends and metrics and may share de-identified and/or aggregate location and movement data with third parties for advertising, research, analytics, and other purposes.  We may share location information in some instances as described below.
