# AdBlock Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes AdBlock's information practices for its website and browser extension. We take your privacy seriously and want you to understand exactly what information we collect, how we process that information, which pieces of information you can request us to remove, and how to contact us about this policy. Please read this policy carefully. When it comes to your personal information, most of this policy applies to users who choose to donate to support AdBlock. If all you do is use the extension then you're practically, except for an anonymous, unique ID, invisible to us. 

## Who is responsible for data collection and processing (contacts)?

**Controller**

The legal person responsible for the collection, processing and / or use of personal information in connection with our websites and products ("Controller") is:

**BetaFish, Inc.**  
337 Garden Oaks Blvd, #99623  
Houston, TX 77018  
info@getadblock.com  


**Representative in the European Union**

Our representative in the European Union in accordance with Art. 27 General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) is:

**#LOGIN Datenschutzberatung**  
Rommerskirchener Straße 21, 50259  
Pulheim, Germany  
Attention: Sascha Kremer  


**What is personal information?**

The purpose of data protection is to protect personal information. Personal information means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (" **data subject** "). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. This information includes, for example, details such as name and email address, but also information in connection with payments. 

## Information AdBlock collects

**Personal information**

When you visit the AdBlock website we collect IP address, unique ID, logging of some of the button clicks on our website (clicking download, for example) and user event logging data. When the AdBlock extension communicates with AdBlock servers, we receive the computer’s IP address. After six months we will remove any identifying information such as IP address from our log files and databases. 

When you donate from the AdBlock website, we collect and store all information, excluding the credit card number, given during the payment process. This includes IP address, unique ID, logging some of the button clicks (payment, download buttons) and user event logging. AdBlock does not handle or have access to full credit card numbers, bank account details or payment account login information. Each payment processor stores and uses the data you provide them differently. 

AdBlock uses both Stripe and PayPal as payment processors when you donate to AdBlock. To learn more about their data collection policies, please consult their respective privacy policies when using them. 

**AdBlock Premium**

When you purchase or otherwise obtain a AdBlock Premium license AdBlock will store information regarding the license, including: unique extension identifiers associated with the license, email associated with the license, last license check timestamp and license status. This data will be stored during the active lifetime of the license and for a period after cancellation. 

The same data that is stored when you make a donation to AdBlock is stored when you purchase Premium. 

**AdBlock Premium - Sync**

If you elect to use the Sync feature of AdBlock Premium then AdBlock collects information about the particular extension installation, including: unique extension identifier, sync device name and the timestamp of when the sync enrollment was made. This data will be stored during the active lifetime of the license and for a period after cancellation. 

AdBlock also stores the entire set of extension settings in plain text on our servers to accomodate the sync functionality across multiple extension installations. This storage location has restricted access and is only made available to AdBlock employees to diagnose and fix errors with the sync service. Every reasonable precaution is taken to secure this storage location but no database or server is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the extension settings data. If you have concerns about the AdBlock extension settings data being compromised, since there is no current mechanism to encrypt the data from the user's end, please carefully consider whether you want to use this feature. 

Finally, AdBlock Premium - Sync uses PubNub for real time sync notifications. Please refer to the [ PubNub privacy policy](https://www.pubnub.com/privacy-policy/) for information on their data collection policies. PubNub is used to alert the extension of a new settings version only and does not have access to the extension settings information. 

**Anonymous information**

The AdBlock extension captures anonymous usage information including, but not limited to, the version number of the extension, preferred language, Acceptable Ads opt-in, opt-in to advanced features like our local content caching service, number of blocked requests, number of ads blocked, and browser and operating system type. The AdBlock extension also assigns an anonymous, unique ID to each installation. We store aggregate statistics about the installation connected with each user ID indefinitely. We utilize this information to help us identify and fix potential issues with AdBlock as well as to determine the performance of AdBlock features. 

The iOS extension captures connection type (wifi or mobile) in addition to the data that the browser extension captures. 

**Extension error information**

An error report is automatically sent to AdBlock's servers whenever an error occurs in the extension. The report contains the anonymous information stated previously along with the current browser version and a description of the error. If a URL exists in the error description then the extension will attempt to remove it. The data is used for troubleshooting and to identify general defects which lead to unexpected crashes or errors. After 7 days we will remove this information from our log files and databases. 

**Server logs**

Logs for general requests made to getadblock.com or its infrastructure are kept for up to 90 days. These logs include the IP address, browser, operating system, and page address. We will anonymize the IP address by using a hash to encrypt this information and we will immediately delete the original IP address. This data is used to generate usage statistics as well as to investigate potential security issues. After 90 days, we will remove this information from our log files and databases. 

Logs for payment processing requests are kept in accordance with US tax law retention periods and will be deleted after the end of the respective retention period. Information in these logs includes IP address, email (if provided), address (if provided), name (if provided), browser type and version, operating system, payment amount, payment type, card type, expiration date, and last four digits of the card if a card is used. This data is used to provide insights into the financial performance of AdBlock. 

**Analytics**

AdBlock uses Google Analytics to aggregate information about traffic patterns and how our website and extension are used. We limit the data sent to Google Analytics, and only do so to improve our extension and website. You can find information about Google Analytics’ data collection practices, as well as its privacy policy [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245). 

**For users in the European Union and European Economic Area**

We use Google Analytics on our Website, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies" (text files which are stored on your computer and which enable you to analyse your use of our Website). The information generated by the cookie on your use of our Website (including your abbreviated IP address) is transmitted to a Google server in the United States and are stored there. Google will use this information to assess your use of our Website, to compile reports on the activities for us and to provide more services connected with use of our Website and the internet. It is also possible that Google may transmit this information to third parties if this is required by law, or if third parties process this information on behalf of Google. 

**You can deactivate Google Analytics by means of a browser add-on if you do not want to participate in Website analysis. You can download this here:<https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de>**

## How AdBlock processes and discloses collected information

**We try to make AdBlock better**

We use the collected usage and analytics information to maintain and improve the AdBlock extension and website, gain insight into how our services are being used, and in our efforts to prevent fraud. The information is only used internally. 

**Your information is not for sale**

AdBlock never has and never will sell your personal information to any third party without your consent. We sometimes share anonymized and aggregated information that cannot be associated with an individual with third parties or the public. 

**AdBlock discloses personal information as required by law**

AdBlock cooperates with all valid United States law enforcement requests and court orders. If possible, we'll notify you of requests for your information using the email stored in our system. Some circumstances prohibit us from contacting you about a request or order (e.g. an order under 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b) or § 215 of the Patriot Act). ["Warrant canary"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary): AdBlock has never received an order under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, and if this sentence ever disappears, you'll know it's because we have received such an order -- or similar order -- and the U.S. Government made us delete it. 

**AdBlock discloses personal information as part of business development**

As part of the further development of our business, it may happen that the structure of BetaFish, Inc. changes. The legal structure may be adapted, subsidiaries, business units or components may be created, bought or sold. In such transactions user information may be shared with the transmitted part of the company. In the event of a transfer of personal information BetaFish, Inc. will ensure that it is done in accordance to this privacy policy and the GDPR and applicable EU laws. 

We will not transfer your personal data to third parties as a matter of course without letting you know in advance. We will ask for your prior permission unless the transfer of such data is permitted by GDPR or any other applicable EU laws. 

## External services

AdBlock uses external services that may require you to enter personal information. We currently use FreshDesk (privacy policy [here](https://www.freshworks.com/privacy/)) for AdBlock's [knowledge base and support system](https://help.getadblock.com/). AdBlock has used other services in the past and may use more in the future. We do not control the data on these external services and can not remove or delete the data; any data given to external services is not bound by this policy, and you should read the external service's privacy policy before providing any information. 

## Data security

All personal and usage information that AdBlock collects is stored in our databases and AdBlock takes reasonable steps to keep it secure. That said, no database or server is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data in our system or while being transmitted over the Internet. Our best effort is given, but you use AdBlock's website and browser extension at your own risk.
