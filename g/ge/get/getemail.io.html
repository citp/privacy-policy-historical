<h4>How We Use the Information We Collect</h4>

<p>We use the information that we collect in a variety of ways in providing the Service and operating our business, including the following:</p>

<h5>Operations</h5>

<p>We use the information – other than Client Data - to operate, maintain, enhance and provide all features of the Service, to provide the services and information that you request, to respond to comments and questions and to provide support to users of the Service. We process Client Data solely in accordance with the directions provided by the applicable Client or User.</p>

<h5>Improvements</h5>

<p>We use the information – other than Client Data - to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Visitors and Users, to improve the Service, and to develop new products, services, feature, and functionality.</p>

<h5>Communications</h5>

<p>We may use a Visitor’s or User’s email address or other information – other than Client Data – to contact that Visitor or User (i) for administrative purposes such as customer service, to address intellectual property infringement, right of privacy violations or defamation issues related to the Client Data or Personal Data posted on the Service or (ii) with updates on promotions and events, relating to products and services offered by us and by third parties we work with. You have the ability to opt-out of receiving any promotional communications as described below under <strong>“Your Choices.”</strong></p>

<h5>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h5>

<p>We use automatically collected information and other information collected on the Service through cookies and similar technologies to: (i) personalize our Service, such as remembering a User’s or Visitor’s information so that the User or Visitor will not have to re-enter it during a visit or on subsequent visits; (ii) provide customized advertisements, content, and information; (iii) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of Service and third-party marketing activities; (iv) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (v) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities on the Service. You can obtain more information about cookies by visiting <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<h5>Analytics</h5>

<p>We use Google Analytics to measure and evaluate access to and traffic on the Public Area of the Site, and create user navigation reports for our Site administrators.

For more information, see <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245" target="_blank">Google Analytics Privacy and Data Sharing</a>. </p>

<p>We take measures to protect the technical information collected by our use of Google Analytics. The data collected will only be used on a need to know basis to resolve technical issues, administer the Site and identify visitor preferences; but in this case, the data will be in non-identifiable form. We do not use any of this information to identify Visitors or Users.</p>

<h5>Service Providers</h5>

These third parties may have access to, or process Personal Data or Client Data as part of providing those services for us. We limit the information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and our contracts with them require them to maintain the confidentiality of such information.</p>

<h5>Non Personally Identifiable Information</h5>

<p>We may make certain automatically-collected, aggregated, or otherwise non-personally-identifiable information available to third parties for various purposes, including (i) compliance with various reporting obligations; (ii) for business or marketing purposes; or (iii) to assist such parties in understanding our Clients’, Users’ and Visitors’ interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, and/or functionality available through the Service.</p>

<h4>Your Choices</h4>

<h5>Access, Correction, Deletion</h5>

<p>We respect your privacy rights and provide you with reasonable access to the Personal Data that you may have provided through your use of the Services.  If you wish to access or amend any other Personal Data we hold about you, or to request that we delete any information about you that we have obtained from an Integrated Service, you may contact us as set forth in the “How to Contact Us” section.

<h4>Third-Party Services</h4>

<p>The Service may contain features or links to web sites and services provided by third parties. Any information you provide on third-party sites or services is provided directly to the operators of such services and is subject to those operators’ policies, if any, governing privacy and security, even if accessed through the Service. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third-party sites or services to which links or access are provided through the Service. We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with information.</p>

<h4>Your California Privacy Rights</h4>

<p>We will not share any Personal Data with third-parties for their direct marketing purposes to the extent prohibited by California law.  If our practices change, we will do so in accordance with applicable laws and will notify you in advance.</p>

<h4>Interest Based Advertising</h4>

<p>Interest based advertising is the collection of data from different sources and across different platforms in order to predict an individual’s preferences or interest and to deliver to that individual, or his/her computer, smart phone or tablet, advertising based on his/her assumed preference or interest inferred from the collection of data pertaining to that individual or others who may have a similar profile or similar interests.</p>

<p>We work with a variety of third parties to attempt to understand the profiles of the individuals who are most likely to be interested in the GetEmail.io products or services so that we can send them promotional emails, or serve our advertisements to them on the websites and mobile apps of other entities.</p>

<p>These third parties include: (a) advertising networks, which collect information about a person’s interests when that person views or interacts with one of their advertisements; (2) attribution partners, which measure the effectiveness of certain advertisements; and (3) business partners, which collect information when a person views or interacts with one of their advertisements.</p>

<p>In collaboration with these third parties, we collect information about our customers, prospects and other individuals over time and across different platforms when they use these platforms or interact with them. Individuals may submit information directly on our Sites or on platforms run by third parties, or by interacting with us, our advertisements, or emails they receive from us or from third parties.  We may use special tools that are commonly used for this purpose, such as cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, mobile advertising IDs, flash cookies, and similar technologies.  We may have access to databases of information collected by our business partners.</p>

<p>The information we or third party collect enables us to learn what purchases the person made, what ads or content the person sees, on which ads or links the person clicks, and other actions that the person takes on our Sites, or in response to our emails, or when visiting or using third parties’ platforms.</p>

<p>We, or the third parties with which we work, use the information collected as described above to understand the various activities and behaviors of our customers, Site visitors and others. We, or these third parties, do this for many reasons, including: to recognize new or past visitors to our Sites; to present more personalized content; to provide more useful and relevant ads - for example, if we know what ads you are shown we can try not to show you the same ones repeatedly; to identify visitors across devices, sales channels, third party websites and Sites, or to display or send personalized or targeted ads and other custom content that is more focused on a person’s perceived interest in products or services similar to those that we offer.</p>

<p>Our interest-based ads may be served to you in emails or on third-party platforms. We may serve these ads about our products or services or send commercial communications directly ourselves or through these third parties.</p>

<p>Visitors may opt out of receiving interest based advertising by advertising networks that may be delivered to them on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/consumers</a>; and <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>. These features will opt a Visitor out of many – but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage.</p>

<h4>Do Not Track Policy</h4>

<p>California law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal. Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently respond to Do Not Track signal. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat Do Not Track signals. </p>

<p>In the meantime, you may opt out of receiving interest based advertising from advertising networks that may be delivered on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites. If you want to opt out of this online behavioral advertising, visit the following sites: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/consumers</a> and <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>

<p>This will opt you out of many – but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage. Choices you make may be browser and device specific. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or a different computer or device, you may need to update your opt-out choices. Other third-party Sites provide visitors with the ability to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads on their Sites that you need to control through your settings on that Site. For example, to opt out of Google’s use of your online behavior for advertising purposes, visit Google’s Ad Settings page.</p>

<h4>Third Party Cookies</h4>

<p>California law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose whether other third parties may collect personally identifiable information about an individual's online activities from their site or service. We allow third parties with which we have a separate agreement to use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Site. These third parties include (1) business partners, which collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on the Site; and (2) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of their advertisements. </p>

<p>The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your interests or preferences so that they can display advertisements or promotional material on this Site and on other sites across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.</p>

<p>The business partners and advertising networks that serve interest-based advertisements on the Services have limited access to a small amount of information about your profile and your device, which is necessary to serve you advertisements that are tailored to your apparent interests.  It is possible that they may reuse this small amount of information on other sites or services.</p>

<p>We do not share with these third parties any information that would readily identify you (such as email address); however, these third parties may have access to information about your device (such as IP or MAC address). We do not have access to, or control over, the technologies that these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Other than as discussed in this document, we have no control over these third parties.</p>

<h5>The Following Types of Cookies Are Used in the Site:</h5>

<ul>
	<li>strictly necessary/essential cookies - These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website.

The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.</li>

	<li>behaviourally targeted advertising cookies - These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.</li>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession. This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission through public internet, and we also employ application-layer security features to further anonymize Personal Data.</p>

<p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If you believe your Personal Data has been compromised, please contact us as set forth in the “How to Contact Us” section.</p>

<p>If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform you of the occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<h4>Data Retention</h4>

<p>We only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as long as the User’s account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>billing information is retained for a period of 7 years as of their provision to GetEmail.io in accordance with the Estonian accounting and taxation laws</li>
	<li>information on legal transactions between Client and GetEmail.io is retained for a period of 10 years as of their provision to GetEmail.io in accordance with the general limitation period set for civil claims in the Estonian General Part of the Civil Code Act</li>
</ul>

<h4>Privacy Settings</h4>

<p>Although we may allow you to adjust your privacy settings to limit access to certain Personal Data, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the Service. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Further, even after information posted on the Service is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Service. We cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on or transmit to the Service will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.</p>

<h4>Data Transfer</h4>

<p>We may transfer, process and store Personal Data we collect through the Services in centralized databases located in the U.S. The U.S. may not have the same data protection framework as the country from which you may be using the Services. When we transfer Personal Data to the U.S., we will protect it as described in this Privacy Policy. We will comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information from Europe to the U.S.</p>

<h4>Foreign Visitors</h4>

<p>The Service is hosted in the United States. If you choose to use the Service from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your Client Data and Personal Data outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing. Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service. By providing any information, including Client Data and Personal Data, on or to the Service, you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing.</p>

<h4>Data Controller and Data Processor</h4>

<p>GetEmail.io does not own, control or direct the use of any of the Client Data stored or processed by a Client or User via the Service. Only the Client or Users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Client Data. GetEmail.io is largely unaware of what Client Data is actually being stored or made available by a Client or User to the Service and does not directly access such Client Data except as authorized by the Client, or as necessary to provide Services to the Client and its Users.</p>

<p>Because GetEmail.io does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained in the Client Data and because it does not determine the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Data, or the uses of such Personal Data, GetEmail.io is not acting in the capacity of data controller in terms of the European Union’s Directive 95/46/EC on data privacy or the European Data Protection Regulation (“EU Law”) and does not have the associated responsibilities under EU Law. GetEmail.io should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Clients and Users as to any Client Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements of EU Law. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, GetEmail.io does not independently cause Client Data containing Personal Data stored in connection with the Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third parties, except to third party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of GetEmail.io in connection with GetEmail.io’s provision of Services to Clients. Such actions are performed or authorized only by the applicable Client or User.</p>

<p>The Client or the User is the data controller under the Directive for any Client Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Data.</p>

<p>GetEmail.io is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the Client Data or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors’ servers) at the discretion of the Client or User nor is GetEmail.io responsible for the manner in which the Client or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information.</p>

<h4>Changes and Updates to this Policy</h4>

<p>Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which we may update from time to time. If we modify the Policy, we will make it available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest revision, and will comply with applicable law. Your continued use of the Service after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy.</p>

<h4>How to Contact Us</h4>

<p>Please contact us with any questions or comments about this Policy, your Personal Data, our use and disclosure practices, or your consent choices by email at <a href="mailto:contact@getemail.io">contact@getemail.io</a>.</p>
