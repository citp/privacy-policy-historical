                    <h2>Cookies</h2>
                    <p>Similar to other commercial websites, the technology called "cookies" may be used to provide you with tailored information. A cookie is a small piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. You may be able to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. Our cookies collect general information that enhances our ability to serve you and measure the utility of our website.</p>
                    <h2>Information Security</h2>

We restrict access to Personal Information about you to those employees and others who need to know that information to assist us in our business, or to provide products or services to you. We safeguard personal information, according to established security standards and procedures, by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards for the information.</p>
                    <p>When we request customers to enter sensitive information (such as the credit card number), it is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry -- SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon at the bottom of web browsers, such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.</p>
                    <p>All of our customers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk, or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable informatio</p>
