Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you, your Account or your web browser. 

HOW, AND WITH WHOM, IS MY INFORMATION SHARED?

The Services are designed to help you share information with others. As a result, some of the information generated through the Services is shared with third parties. 

INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR ACTIVITY ON THE SERVICES:

Registered users may have some of the information about their activity on and through the Services associated with their Accounts.

AGGREGATE INFORMATION:

We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business.

INFORMATION DISCLOSED PURSUANT TO BUSINESS TRANSFERS:

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention. 

INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH YOUR CONSENT:

Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information. 

IS INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?

Your Account information will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account.

We do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal Information or otherwise.
