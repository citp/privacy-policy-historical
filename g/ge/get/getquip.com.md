# quip | Privacy Policy

**privacy policy**

 **At Quip NYC, Inc. d/b/a quip (“quip”, “Quip”, “we”, “us” or “our”) we take your privacy and the security of your information very seriously.

. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) covers quip owned and operated websites, including www.getquip.com (“Site” or “Sites”) and any services offered by quip, including our provision of oral healthcare devices and associated services (collectively, the “Services.”) This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and is part of, our Terms of Use available at https://www.getquip.com/terms which govern your access to the Site and your use of the Site and/or Services. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Terms of Use. 

If you have any questions regarding this Policy please contact us at Help@getquip.com. 

The Policy describes the types of information we gather from people visiting our Site and from individual users (“you” or “users”) interacting with the Services, and how we use, transfer, and secure such information. By accessing any of our Site or using any of the Services, you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy does not govern information we receive from third parties. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Site, or any of our Services. Each time you use any Sites, or Services, the current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, when you use any Site or Services, you should check the date of this Policy (which appears at the top) and review any changes since you last reviewed the Policy. 

_1 | Types of Information We Collect_

Quip may collect two types of information from users of our Sites and Services: “Personal Information” which is information that you provide that can be used to identify you (such as name or e-mail address, etc.) and “Aggregate Information” which is information that cannot be used to identify you (such as frequency of visits to the Site, browser type, etc.) 

1.1. _Personal Information Collected_

1.1.1. Quip collects Personal Information you voluntarily provide to us when you use our Sites and Services. For example, you may provide us with your email address, first name and last name, shipping address, or other Personal Information. 

1.1.2. We do not control your use of our Sites and Services to share Personal Information with others. If you chose to share information publicly through our Site or Services please understand that we cannot control the actions of third parties who could collect this information. 

1.1.3. _Collection of Personal Information by Third Parties:_

1.1.4. Some links on our Site may redirect you to third party websites and services that We do not operate. The privacy practices of these websites and services will be governed by their own policies. We make no representation or warranty as to the privacy policies of any third parties, including the providers of third party applications. If you are submitting information to any such third party through our Site or Services, you should review and understand that party’s applicable policies, including their privacy policy, before providing your information to the third party. 

1.1.5. For example, it is possible that your payment information, such as credit card or debit card information, and may be collected and stored by third party payment vendors, should you choose to provide such a payment method to a third party through your use of the Site or Services. 

1.1.6. We do not currently collect financial information, such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information); that information is collected and stored by our third party payment processing company (the “Payment Processor”) which is currently Stripe, and use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable terms of service and privacy policy (for Stripe, available at: https://stripe.com/us/legal and https://stripe.com/us/privacy or any of its successor sites). We may from time to time request and receive certain information from our Payment Processor or from you directly for purposes of completing transactions you have initiated through the Services, protecting against or identifying possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business. In no cases will such requested information allow for a financial transaction to be initiated. 

1.2. _Aggregate Information Collected_

1.2.1. Aggregate Information is information that does not identify you. Aggregate Information may be collected when you visit our Site or interact with our Services independent of any information you voluntarily enter. We may collect, use, store, and transfer Aggregate Information without restriction. 

1.2.2. For example, when you visit our Site, some information is automatically collected. Such information could include your operating system, the site from which you linked to us (“referring page”), the name of the website you chose to visit immediately after ours (called the “exit page”), information about other websites you have recently visited, browser (software used to browse the internet) type and language, device identifier numbers, your site activity, and the time and date of your visit. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our visitors, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser at this time.
