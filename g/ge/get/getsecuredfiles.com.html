            <p>You have to be aware about the fact that GetPortal does not knowingly collect any personal data that can identify a user,
                such as e-mail, name, gender, age, login names, telephone numbers, address and passwords or any other self-identifying
                information (hereinafter referred to as the "Personal Information"). GetPortal reserves the right to use cookies on the
                Site.
                GetPortal may automatically receive and save some non-personally identifiable information at its server, such as logs from
                the user's browser, including IP-address, type of browser, internet service provider (ISP), cookie, other technical data and
                the webpage that is being visited. GetPortal collects non-personally identifiable information only for general purposes,

                hard drive to assign a unique identification for your computer. GetPortal does not store information that is considered
                personal or private in a cookie. This eliminates the chance of other sites reading our cookies and learning your personal or

                web site, by indicating that you are a repeat visitor to our site. We also may use that information to present you with
                services which are easy-to-use and customized to your preferences. We do this in order to track visitors, to reduce the
                chance of blocking legitimate users, and to provide customized services.

            <h3>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</h3>

            <p>The GetPortal may contain links to other sites. Those sites are not under our control; therefore, we make no
                representations as to the accuracy or integrity of their content. When you access a non-GetPortal web site,
                you do so at your own risk, and our inclusion of such links does not imply that we endorse or accept any responsibility
                for their content or use. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of those web sites as well.

                so
                that users can constantly be aware of what kind of information GetPortal collects, in what way the information is used and
                according to what circumstances such information may be disclosed.</p>
