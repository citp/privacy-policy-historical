</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever you visit or interact with the Service or Site, we, as well as similar third-party vendors and/or service providers alike, we may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Service is accessed and used (“<strong>Usage Information</strong>”).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, device type, an estimation of your geographic location associated with your IP address, the page served, the time, referring URLs and other information normally transmitted in HTTP requests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This <strong>statistical data</strong> provides us with information about the use of the Service, such as how many visitors visit a specific web-page on which the Service is used, how long they stay on that page, the type of content on that page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but to the extent Usage Information may be associated with you as a specific and identifiable person (for example, because you have registered for the Service) and thereby provided us with personal information (such as name, e-mail address, telephone number or home address) we treat such information as “<strong>Personal Information”</strong> and will only use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also automatically collect the internet protocol (“<strong>IP</strong>“) address or other identifier (“<strong>Device Identifier</strong>“) for each computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, “<strong>Device</strong>“) you use to access the Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Service uses several different technologies to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers. These may include, without limitation:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a class="anchor" name="1a"></a><strong>Cookies - </strong></p>
<p>Cookies are small text files placed on a Device when the Device is used to visit the Service or the Site. We may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while using the Service, such as showing you specific offer(s) that we think will be of interest to you.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We also use cookies in order to keep you logged in to the Service if you register with us. Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on the Service and pages visited. Cookies may include a Device Identifier along with information about the particular type of content in which you have shown interest. Cookies also allow us to select which content is most likely to appeal to you and display that content while you are using the Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When interacting with the Service, if you click on a link to one of our promoted offer(s), the customer sponsoring the promoted link may place a cookie on your Device as well, in which case you will be subject to their privacy policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that you are subject to the privacy policies of each site you visit, in addition to ours. If you click on a link to visit a site where the Service is not installed, you are subject only to that site’s privacy policy while visiting that site, and not to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can do this by activating the settings on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies, please be aware that some functions and features of the Service may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Log Files -</strong></p>
<p>As is true of most web sites, we may gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This information may include IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to detect fraud, administer the site, to track users’ actions around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pixels -</strong></p>
<p>A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an e-mail, which indicates that a page or e-mail has been viewed. In addition, a pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.</p>

</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will provide reasonable opportunity for <u>individuals</u> to access, update, or delete Personal Information about them that we have in our possession. We will not use Personal Information provided to us for purposes incompatible with the purpose for which it was provided without obtaining authorization from the subject of the information.</p>
<p><strong>Individuals’ principal rights under data protection law are</strong>:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>the right to access;</strong></p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>the right to rectification;</strong></p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>the right to erasure;</strong></p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>the right to restrict processing;</strong></p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>the right to object to processing;</strong></p>
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>the right to data portability;</strong></p>
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and</strong></p>
<p>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>the right to withdraw consent.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your Personal Information and, where we do, access to the Personal Information, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of Personal Information concerned and the recipients of the Personal Information. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your Personal Information. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Erasure</strong> - In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your Personal Information. Those circumstances include: The Personal Information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed.</p>
<p>There are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
<p>In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection.</p>
<p>Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your Personal Information. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.</p>
<p>You have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is</strong>:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>consent</strong>; or</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract,</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your Personal Information from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
<p>If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection.</p>
<p>To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your Personal Information is consent, <u>you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time</u>. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.</p>
