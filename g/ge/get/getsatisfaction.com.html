<p><strong>1.1</strong> This Privacy Policy explains how Get Satisfaction, Inc. ("we", "us", "our" or "Get Satisfaction") collects, uses and shares your "Personal Information" - information that identifies, relates to, describes or is capable of being associated with you as a particular individual, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number - and other data through your use of any of Get Satisfaction's Web sites, services, application programming interfaces ("APIs") or software (collectively, the "Get Satisfaction Service").</p>

Get Satisfaction reserves the right to update and change this Privacy Policy from time to time without notice or acceptance by you, so please check this page frequently for updates and changes.  However, changes made to this Privacy Policy will not apply to you to the extent that (i) the changes concern matters which are the subject of an actual dispute between you and Get Satisfaction as of the date the changes take effect and (ii) Get Satisfaction has actual notice of the dispute as of the date the changes take effect.</p>

<p><strong>4.3</strong> Get Satisfaction will share your email address with companies that are clients of the Get Satisfaction Service when you authorize Get Satisfaction to do so.

<p><strong>4.4.1</strong> In the course of operating our business, it may be necessary or appropriate for us to provide access to your Personal Information to others such as our service providers, contractors and select vendors so that we can operate the Get Satisfaction Service and our business. Where practical, we seek to obtain confidentiality agreements that are consistent with this Privacy Policy and that limit others' use or disclosure of this Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.2</strong> We may share your Personal Information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, to establish or exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims or in such circumstances where, in our judgment, disclosure is required or appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>5.3</strong> Get Satisfaction's vendors, service providers and business partners may set and access their own cookies on and through the Get Satisfaction Service.
