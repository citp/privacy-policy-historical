				<h2>Privacy Policy of GetPaidToTry.com</h2>
				<p>Please note that our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Changes to the Privacy Policy will be posted on this website and the effective date will be modified to reflect the most recent version. This will be the only notice of any changes made to the Privacy Policy.</p>
				<p>GetPaidToTry.com wants you to know how the data, including, personally identifiable information (PII), it collects or obtains is used. Accordingly, the data collection, acquisition, use and dissemination practices of GetPaidToTry.com are discussed in this policy.
