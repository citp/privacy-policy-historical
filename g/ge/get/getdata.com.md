# GetData privacy policy: We value our customers privacy

This document sets forth the GetData Pty Ltd (GetData) Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") for GetData web sites (the "Site"). If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or use this Site. 

### Changes in Privacy Policy

All "personal information" ("personal information" is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains) that we collect and maintain will be subject to the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of such collection. GetData reserves the right to change the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion, and will provide notice of material changes on the privacy policy page of its web Site. If as the result of such changes, you want to alter the ways in which GetData is allowed to use your personal information, you can do so by following the procedure described below in the section titled "Updating your personal information and privacy preferences."

You will be deemed to have been made aware of, and will be subject to, the changes to the Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Site after such notice has been posted. If GetData sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, or GetData (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by, or merged with, another entity, GetData may provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without your consent.
