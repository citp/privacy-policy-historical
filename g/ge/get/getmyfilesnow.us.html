    <strong>Notice to European Users</strong><br>
    The information You enter on or through An Extension or otherwise provide to us may be transferred outside of the European Union to the United States of
    America, which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union. In particular, You are advised that the United
    States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. Article 26
    of the European Union's Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union
    to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level
    of protection. By agreeing to the terms of use and this privacy policy, You consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of
    America, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union and to the processing of that information by us on
    our servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.
