			<div class="page" id="index" title="Privacy Policy">

			<p>
				<strong>This Privacy Policy discloses the general privacy practices for web sites owned and/or operated by NewsBank, Inc., NewsBank Media Services, Inc. and their affiliated companies (collectively, "NewsBank"). It does not apply to any information that may be obtained offline. Any changes to this policy will be posted on this page with an updated "effective date" posted at the end of this policy.</strong>
			</p>


			<h5>Information Collected</h5>
			<p>
				<i>Voluntary Submissions Only.</i> While visiting any of the NewsBank web sites (collectively, the "Site"), we may ask you to register and/or provide information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") for purposes of interacting with the Site. Such Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, street address, and e-mail address. On any page that collects Personal Information, we will specifically describe what information is required in order to provide you with the product or service, enter you in the promotion you have requested, or respond to your inquiry or comment. The only way we learn Personal Information is if you specifically and voluntarily submit it to us. While we may log IP addresses (the location of a computer on the Internet) from visitors for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes and to determine site usage, IP addresses do not contain Personal Information.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>What are Cookies?</i> A cookie is a small data text file that a web site sends to your browser, which is stored on your system.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Why do we use cookies?</i> To track usage of the Site and to help tailor it to the interests and needs of visitors. By tracking usage, we can best determine the features that serve you best. In addition, by identifying a user's computer (but not any Personal Information about the user) to our server, cookies allow users to avoid retyping their e-mail addresses and passwords each time they access the Site.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Third Parties' Cookies.</i> We may use an advertising server, developed by a third party, to display ads, which may contain cookies from third-party advertisers. We do not have access to these cookies or any information in them. We encourage you to contact any advertiser and consult its privacy policy for more information on cookies used by such advertisers. Links from other web sites that appear on the Site may also send cookies; but we do not control such activities.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>May I decline cookies?</i> Yes, by selecting an option on your browser. If you do so, however, portions of the Site which require registration may not be accessible to you, and you may need to re-submit certain registration information each time you access our Site.
			</p>

			<h5>How Do We Use Personal Information?</h5>
			<p>
				We may use your Personal Information, such as your e-mail address or mailing address, to contact you regarding products and/or services that we believe may be of interest to you, or to respond to an inquiry from you regarding the information that we have collected, or to respond to your comments and suggestions. You will at all times be able to opt out from receiving advertising communications from us, either by specifically opting out of these communications or by deleting your profile from our database. Please refer to "Opting-Out" for details.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you sign up for a service we offer on the Site, we may share your Personal Information with third-party service providers, such as credit card processors, shipping companies and fulfillment services, in order to provide the service. These third parties are required to comply with this policy and protect your information in the same way we do. They are not permitted to retain or use Personal Information for any purpose unrelated to providing the service you requested.
			</p>
			<p>
				NewsBank may also offer services and opportunities from unaffiliated third parties on the Site (information notification services, personalized news alerts, sweepstakes, etc.). If you choose to use these optional services or opportunities, we may provide some of your Personal Information to these parties. Some of these third parties may also collect their own Personal Information. We encourage you to check the applicable privacy policy for that portion of the Site prior to disclosing Personal Information. Please see "Party Collecting the Information" for further reference. From time to time we may also become aware of third parties offering services or opportunities separately from this Site that we believe may be of interest to you, and we may furnish Personal Information to such parties to enable them to inform you about those services or opportunities.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, we reserve the right to disclose Personal Information when needed to comply with the law or a legal process, to cooperate with investigations of purported unlawful activities, and to identify persons violating the law. In the event of a sale of part or all of NewsBank's or its affiliates' stock or assets, our databases, including any Personal Information, will be transferred to the new owner.
			</p>

			<h5>Party Collecting the Information</h5>
			<p>
				This Privacy Policy only addresses the collection, use and dissemination of Personal Information you submit to NewsBank via the Site, and not any Personal Information you may disclose to other parties (including via third-party services or promotions offered on or through the Site). Different policies may apply to Personal Information you give to such third parties, and NewsBank shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of any such Personal Information.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our Site may operate as part of a larger group of sites, and may carry co-branded pages. In addition, other sites may use the Site's or NewsBank's name. Since NewsBank does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies, if any, of such third parties, and NewsBank shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of your Personal Information by such parties. Therefore, we encourage you to ask questions and review those parties' privacy policies before you disclose your Personal Information to others.
			</p>


			<h5>Links To Other Materials</h5>
			<p>
				Third party sites linked to and from the Site are not necessarily under the control of NewsBank. NewsBank shall have no responsibilities or liabilities whatsoever for the content or privacy practices of any such linked site or any link or linking program at any time. NewsBank does not necessarily endorse companies (or related products or services) to or from which the Site is linked. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to the Site, you do so entirely at your own risk.
			</p>


			<h5>Children's Privacy</h5>
			<p>
				NewsBank cares about the safety of children and their use of the Internet. Therefore, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request or solicit personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. In the event that we receive actual knowledge that we have collected such personal information without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as is practicable.
			</p>


			<h5>Opting-Out</h5>
			<p>
				We respect your privacy and ability to choose whether to share information with us and any third party. You may choose to "opt-out" of sharing Personal Information in several ways. When choosing to use certain features or services on the Site, you can choose whether to share optional Personal Information in connection with the feature or service. If you receive communications from us that you prefer not to receive, you may opt out from receiving these communications by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@newsbank.com">privacypolicy@newsbank.com</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may "opt-out" altogether from providing Personal Information to us by not registering on the Site and thereby not providing Personal Information. You may also choose at a later date to confirm the accuracy of your Personal Information that you have provided to us, or to have your name removed from our database, by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@newsbank.com">privacypolicy@newsbank.com</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Certain portions of the Site and certain services provided on the Site, however, do require registration in order to access or use these areas and services. If you choose not to register or provide certain information, these areas will not be accessible to you.
			</p>


			<h5>Security</h5>
			<p>
				NewsBank maintains industry standard safeguards to help protect the security, integrity, and privacy of the Personal Information that you provide to NewsBank. Please understand, however, that there are inherent security risks in any online medium, and no guarantee can be made against unauthorized access by third parties.
			</p>

			<h5>How To Contact Us</h5>
			<p>
				If you have any questions or comments about our Privacy Policy, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@newsbank.com">privacypolicy@newsbank.com</a>.
			</p>

			<h5>Effective Date And Changes</h5>
			<p>
				This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 1, 2003. NewsBank reserves the right to modify the terms of this policy at any time and in our sole discretion, by posting a change notice to this page. Your continued use of the Site following our posting of a change notice will constitute binding acceptance of those changes.
