**PRIVACY POLICY**

The information we learn about you from your visit to our Web site depends on what you do when visiting our site. If you read or download information, we collect and store only the following: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, AOL.com*, if you are connecting from an America Online* account); the date and time; and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site (if applicable). We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site and to help us make our site more useful. 

In some of our sites, polls are taken or opinions are sought, but these activities are for entertainment only. None of these correspondences are ever shared or given to a third party. In some cases, we may ask for e-mail addresses to execute an activity such as sending an email to a friend. If you use our e-mail to a friend feature, your email address will be placed in the "From" field, and any information submitted will be used only to email your message to the person of your choice. Neither your email address or the e-mail address of your friend will be gathered, stored, or used for any other purpose by General Mills or any third party. Again, these addresses are used solely for the purpose of the activity in question and they are not collected by us. It is at the users discretion to enter in his/her e-mail address and those destination addresses of his/her choosing. 

If you identify yourself by sending an e-mail to us to ask a specific question, we will use your e-mailed information to answer your question and to further our consumer protection and competitive activities, but we will not disclose any information to a third party. We want to be very clear: We will not obtain personal identification information about you when you visit our site unless you choose to provide it. Any information collected will not be disclosed to a third party. 

It is General Mills' aim to adhere to the CARU guidelines as they pertain to advertising and privacy rights of children. We welcome your comments and questions. For more information, please click the "Legal" text line at the bottom of the page.
