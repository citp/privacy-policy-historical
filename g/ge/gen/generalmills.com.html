							<b>Effective Date:&nbsp;October 18, 2004</b><br>
							<br>
							<p>At General Mills, we are very sensitive to the privacy concerns of visitors to 
								all of our websites, including this one. Though we do not obtain any personal 
								information that individually identifies you (e.g., your name, address, phone 
								number, e-mail address, etc.) unless you affirmatively provide it to us, many 
								visitors do choose to provide us with such information. This Privacy Policy 
								explains our online information practices and the choices you, as a visitor to 
								this site, can make about the collection and use of your information.
							</p>
							<h3>What personal information might we ask you for and how do we use it?</h3>
							<p>We collect personal information from you (such as your name, address, phone 
								number, e-mail address, etc.) only when you voluntarily provide it to us. 
								Depending on the purpose for which the information was provided, we may use the 
								information to communicate with you regarding our products, services, and 
								promotions, to provide you with other information that you request, and/or to 
								improve our product and service offerings.
							</p>
							<p>Here are the circumstances in which we might ask for personal information from 
								our consumers though our site, the types of information we obtain, and how we 
								use the information:
								</p><ul>
									<li>
									If you contact one of our Consumer Services Representatives through our site, 
									we may ask you for personal information such as your name, address, phone 
									number, or e-mail address so that we can respond to your questions or comments. 
									(Of course, if you send us an e-mail, we will at a minimum obtain your e-mail 
									address.)
									</li><li>
										You may be asked to provide personal information if you:
										<ul>
											<li>
											register for a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion;
											</li><li>
											register as a user of our site;
											</li><li>
											register to receive coupons through our site;
											</li><li>
											join a club through our site;
											</li><li>
											participate in a survey, a consumer research panel, or similar type of 
											activity;
											</li><li>
											ask to receive an online newsletter or other information or material from us; 
											or
											</li><li>
												otherwise participate in features of our website that ask for personal 
												information.</li>
										</ul>
									</li><li>
										If you purchase or otherwise request a product, publication, or promotional 
										offering from us or take advantage of a rebate or similar offer, you may be 
										required to provide your contact and/or payment information (such as a credit 
										card number) in order for us to process your request.</li>
								</ul>
							<p></p>
							<p>Your participation in any of these activities (and therefore your provision of 
								personally identifiable information) is entirely voluntary. We may use the 
								information you provide to respond to your questions or comments, to administer 
								our promotions and sites, to fulfill your request, subscription, or order, or 
								to otherwise provide or improve our products and services. We will not send you 
								any online newsletter or similar e-mail communication unless you expressly 
								consent to receive such a communication from us. And if you do choose to 
								receive any such e-mail communication from us, you will always have the 
								opportunity to “unsubscribe” from receiving the e-mail at any time.</p>
							<h3>How do we use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies?</h3>
							<p>We may employ cookie technology, web beacons, and similar devices on our site to 
								facilitate site administration and navigation and to provide an enhanced online 
								experience for our visitors. Information tracked through these mechanisms 
								includes but is not limited to (1) a user’s IP address (e.g., yahoo.com - 
								192.168.1.1), (2) the type of web browser (e.g., Microsoft Explorer) and 
								operating system (e.g., Windows or Linux) being used, (3) the pages of the site 
								a user visits, and (4) other websites a user visited before visiting our 
								site.&nbsp;&nbsp;
							</p>
							<p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so 
								or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable 
								cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. 
								Please note that if you disable cookies, you may be unable to access some 
								customized features on our site. Cookies do not collect or contain your name or 
								e-mail address.
							</p>
							<p>Web beacons are 1x1 single-pixel graphics that allow us to count the number of 
								users who have visited a particular web page or to access certain cookies. We 
								may use web beacons on our websites to count users and to recognize users by 
								accessing our cookies. Being able to access our cookies allows us to 
								personalize our website and improve your experience at our website. We may also 
								include web beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail messages that we send to determine 
								which e-mail messages were opened. Like cookies, web beacons do not collect or 
								contain your name or your e-mail address.
							</p>
							<h3>When might we provide other parties with your personal information?</h3>
							<p>We may share your personal information with other parties if you consent to us 
								sharing such information with third parties.
							</p>
							<p>We also may provide your personal information to third parties who provide 
								services on our behalf. These parties may use the information solely in 
								conjunction with the specific services they provide for us (e.g., fulfillment 
								of an order, responding to your question or comment, providing a sweepstakes 
								prize, deployment of a consumer survey, investigation of a complaint, etc.).
							</p>
							<p>We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event 
								that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third 
								party. We also reserve the right to share information within General Mills 
								amongst our various businesses.</p>
							<p>We reserve the right to disclose any personal information as needed if such 
								information is requested by law enforcement agencies or if we are required to 
								do so by law, regulation, subpoena, court order, or by a government entity. We 
								also may disclose personal information to third parties if we have reason to 
								believe that disclosing such information is necessary to conduct investigations 
								of possible breaches of law, to cooperate in any legal investigation, or to 
								identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating 
								the terms of use of our site.</p>
							<h3>Security for credit card, data and transaction information</h3>
							<p>At General Mills, we are committed to keeping your online transactions safe and 
								secure. In order to reasonably assure the privacy and security of your credit 
								card and other personal data when making an order, we use Secure Sockets Layer 
								(SSL) technology. SSL uses encryption technology to create a secure connection 
								between your computer and ours. We have also put procedures in place to 
								safeguard the information/data we collect from you. We cannot absolutely 
								guarantee the security of any information you provide online; you provide it at 
								your own risk.
							</p>
							<p>
							</p>
							<h3>Links to other sites</h3>
							<p>Our site may contain links to the websites of our subsidiaries and affiliates, 
								and to websites that are owned and operated by third parties. These other 
								websites may have their own privacy policies and would not be governed by this 
								Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content 
								of websites owned and operated by any such third parties. Other websites may 
								collect and treat information collected differently, so we encourage you to 
								carefully read and review the privacy policy for each website you visit.
							</p>
							<h3>Chat rooms and message/bulletin boards</h3>
							<p>
							Users of chat rooms and message/bulletin boards that may be on our site should 
							be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable 
							information (e.g., name, e-mail address, etc.) on a message/bulletin board, in 
							a chat area, or other interactive area where personal information can be 
							posted, the information can be collected and used by other internet users. This 
							may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties. We make no 
							representations and undertake no obligations as to the security of information 
							you voluntarily post in chat rooms and message/bulletin boards.
							</p><p></p>
							<h3>Send-to-a-friend tools</h3>
							<p>
								This site may, from time to time, include a send-to-a-friend application that 
								makes it easy for you to forward information or materials from our site to 
								friends or family by e-mail. In order to address your e-mail message, the 
								application will ask you to input the recipient’s e-mail address and/or similar 
								information (including your e-mail address). This information is only used by 
								the application to address your message so that it can be properly sent. 
								General Mills does not retain any of this information for any purpose.
							</p>
							<h3>Our commitment to children’s privacy</h3>
							<p><u>A special note to parents:</u> This site is not directed to children and we 
								will not request any information from children under 13 at this site. General 
								Mills does have other websites that are geared in whole or in part to a child 
								audience. Our commitment to the privacy of children is described more fully in 
								the privacy policies of those websites. General Mills and its affiliated 
								companies takes special care of the privacy of children under the age of 13. We 
								have developed our privacy practices as they relate to children from guidelines 
								established by the Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU) and in compliance 
								with the requirements established by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection 
								Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). We also recommend that parents monitor their children’s 
								Internet activities and learn and employ software or other tools which can help 
								their children enjoy the fun and entertainment of an on-line experience without 
								compromising their personal safety or allowing them to use the Internet in a 
								manner inconsistent with their parents’ preferences.
