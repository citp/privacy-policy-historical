### 1\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

The categories of information we collect can include:

**_Information We Collect From You Directly._**

  * **Registration.** You can browse our site without providing personal information, but you must create an account in order to access some of the features of our site. When you create an account, we may collect personal information, such as your email address, user name and password and date of birth. If you take part in any interactive features of the Services (such as any contests, games, promotions, quizzes, surveys, research or other services or features), we may collect additional types of personal information. We may also collect information from you if you correspond with us directly.
  * **Profile Information and User Content.** After you set up your account, Genius members may also chose to provide additional information which may be shared through public profiles, such as your user name, a picture to represent yourself (which may or may not be a photo of you), and a personal narrative. You control how much personally identifying information you wish to provide in your public profile. We may collect User Content you provide on the Website and we may display it publicly on your user Profile. For example, your profile page may display information about the pages, artists, or works upon which you have commented. Such information may include "favorites" such as artists, songs and lines. Other users can post to a wall in this profile, where the public can view references to your comments you have made on the Website. If you chose to connect your social media account to your profile, we may also display information from your social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter.
  * **Information we may receive from social network sites:** When you interact with our site through various social media, such as when you login with or link to your social media account, "Like" us on Facebook or share through another social media site, we may receive information from the social network such as your profile information, profile picture, gender, user name, user ID associated with your social media account, age range, language, country, friends list, and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our website or Service. 



We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide our features and services on the website, populate your profile, and communicate with you directly, such as by responding to a request or by providing updates on your IQ or lyrics you have previously commented upon. . You can control your receipt of email messages by clicking the "unsubscribe" button at the bottom of email communications you receive from us. We may also send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, change or updates to features of the Service, or technical and security notices).

### 3\. YOUR CHOICES REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION

**Marketing Communications.** If you do not want to receive promotional emails from us, you can click the "unsubscribe" button on promotional email communications. Note that you will not be able to unsubscribe or opt-out of non-promotional messages regarding your account, such as account verification, password reminders, changes or updates to features of the Service, or technical and security notices. 

As of November 2013, Genius does not share your personal information with third parties for advertising purposes, however we reserve the right to share your personal information, such as email address and user name, with third parties for their marketing purposes in the future if we determine that there may be additional products or services which may be of interest to you. If you wish to have your user name and email address excluded from any such future sharing with partners, please email [privacy@genius.com](mailto:privacy@genius.com) with the subject "Direct Marketing Opt-Out." We will not send you an individualized notification that this policy is being updated if we elect to share information with a partner in this manner, so you must opt-out now. If you have any questions about this opt-out or our marketing practices, please email us at [privacy@genius.com](mailto:privacy@genius.com). 

**Online Advertising.** As of November, 2013, Genius does not engage in online behavioral advertising and does not allow third parties to track your activities on our website over time and across other websites. In the future, we may share certain tracking information with online advertising networks so that they may display ads that may be relevant to your interests on our Service as well as on other websites or apps. Typically, the information we would share in this regard is provided through cookies or similar tracking technologies. The only way to completely "opt out" of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device. Please refer to your browser's or mobile device's technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools. (To learn more about behavioral advertising and to learn how to opt-out, you may wish to visit [http://aboutads.info](http://aboutads.info/)). Depending on your mobile device, you may not be able to control tracking technologies through settings. 

**Do Not Track.** At this time, we do not collect information from you for behavioral advertising purposes, though we may collect persistent identifiers from your browser or mobile device to assist us with providing and improving the Service. Because we collect browsing and persistent identifier data only for analytic and internal purposes, your selection of the "Do Not Track" option provided by your mobile browser will not have any effect on our collection of analytics information or the collection of a persistent identifier. 

**Data Access and Retention:** If you wish to change or delete your profile and personal information, you may contact us at privacy@genius.com and we will amend or delete your personal information within a reasonable time after your request.

We may be able to anonymize your information such that you will no longer be reasonably identifiable. 

### 4\. SECURITY AND STORAGE OF INFORMATION

Genius cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information we collect and that we share with our service providers. Because of the nature of our website, WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ENCRYPT ANY TRANSMISSIONS TO OR FROM THE WEBSITE IN ANY MANNER. IF YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE UNENCRYPTED TRANSMISSION OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION DESCRIBED HEREIN, PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT INFORMATION TO US THROUGH THE WEBSITE. While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches, no website or internet transmission is completely secure and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or other breach will never occur. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.
