This is a legal document which sets out how Genes Reunited handles data which identifies you. You should read it in conjunction with the [ Genes Reunited Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20041212084718id_/http%3A//www.genesreunited.co.uk/genesreunited.asp?wci=terms), of which this Privacy Policy forms part. 

At Genes Reunited, we believe strongly in protecting the privacy of our users’ personal information. This statement describes the privacy practices we apply for the Genes Reunited Service. As part of that, it also expresses our approach to complying with the data protection laws which apply in the United Kingdom. If we change this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of the changed document in the same way as we notify changes to the [ Genes Reunited Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20041212084718id_/http%3A//www.genesreunited.co.uk/genesreunited.asp?wci=terms).

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact Genes Reunited's [ customer service department](https://web.archive.org/web/20041212084718id_/http%3A//www.genesreunited.co.uk/genesreunited.asp?wci=feedback&email=info&subject=Privacy). 

**1.        The information we gather and track. **

·         **Information gathered on registration.** When you register for the Genes Reunited Service, you provide your current name, earlier surname (if different), gender, and email address ("Registration Information"). They are available to you, and capable of being changed, through the Your Details page. 

·         **Cookies.** We use small files known as "cookies" to enhance users’ experience of the Genes Reunited Service as follows: 

·         To hold Members’ login information, so that the family tree you have entered is displayed when you visit the Genes Reunited Service. This option can be turned off by switching the "Remember Your Password" option to "No" in Your Details. 

·         To facilitate optimal use of the Genes Reunited Service by Members, by means of a temporary "session" cookie. These cookies disappear when the Member’s browser session ends, or if the Member clicks the "logoff" text which appears on the Genes Reunited Service. 

** 2\. Sharing and use of information **

·         The over-riding principles we apply are these: 

·         **We, and (where relevant) our credit card processing agents, will not supply your personal data to a third party for commercial exploitation, unless you have opted to permit us to do so in Your Details; and**

·         **the only circumstances in which we will provide any of your personal data to a third party for non-commercial purposes are those contained in this Privacy Policy.**

·         **Registration Information.** Your details and your family tree details are only available to you **except that**  the names you include in your tree, date of birth and place of birth are searchable by other Members. The information displayed as a result of a search does not show you associated with it, but the searching individual has the option to email you to get permission to view your tree. 

·         **Important: Members must have, and continue to have, the express permission of any living person to include their details in a family tree. If a Member is asked to do so, relevant details must be removed. Members are the controllers of the information they input relating to living persons, and therefore have obligations under privacy and data protection laws (such as the Data Protection Act 1998).   Genes Reunited acts as a processor of that information, at the behest of the Member.**

·         **Email addresses.** We do not directly make your email address available to anyone on any screen of the Genes Reunited Service. The only legitimate way of making contact with another Member as a result of viewing a search result found on the Genes Reunited Service is for a Full Member to enter a message which we will send on the Full Member’s behalf to the Member. The email sent will include the sending Full Member’s email address so that the recipient can respond to the sender directly. This means by sending a contact message, the sending Member is disclosing his/her email address. Members may change their email address at any time through Your Details. Members’ personal notes and family tree information must **not** include their email address. If your email system automatically responds to a contact email, your email address will be revealed. 

·         **Advertising. **The Genes Reunited Service may include interactive advertising for other businesses. We may use, and provide to third parties, anonymised demographic data provided by Members to target this advertising more appropriately. 

·         **Newsletters. **We have regular and occasional emails, which Members can decide to take or not, according to their preferences. This option is selected through Your Details. 

·         **Credit Card information.** There has been a lot of publicity about Credit Card security on the Internet so we decided to use Worldpay plc, who operate a secure server, to process our credit card payments. They encrypt Members’ credit or debit card information and authorise payment directly. This means that Members’ credit card details are never revealed to us. Worldpay plc may transfer to, process and hold your credit card information in countries either within or outside the European Economic Area in connection with performing their duties. 

·         **Companies in the Genes Reunited group.** We may share data supplied by you (or collected about you) with our subsidiaries and other companies in our group, but only for the purposes described in this policy. 

·         **Changes in Genes Reunited's business.** If all of the assets which we use to operate our business (or substantially all of them) are acquired by a third party, we may transfer personal data we then hold to that party. 

·         **Place of processing.** The personal information held by us is held on and processed by computers situated in the United Kingdom.

·         **Control of processing.   **Members are the controllers of the data which they input on the Genes Reunited Service, including the information contained in Your Details and in the family trees they create.  It is up to Members to ensure that they have the express permission of any living person to include their details in a family tree on the Genes Reunited Service, to respond immediately to any request to remove any of those details, and to ensure that all input information is accurate and up-to-date.

3.       **Security**

We have security measures in place to protect our customer database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains each Member’s responsibility:

·         to protect against unauthorised access to Your Details; 

·         to ensure against use by anyone else of the Genes Reunited Service through the machine that Member uses while they are "logged on" to the Genes Reunited Service; 

·         to log off or exit from the Genes Reunited Service when not using it; and 

·         to keep his/her password secret. 

4.       **Opt-out policy**

·         You may have your registration details removed at any time. To remove yourself please click [ here](https://web.archive.org/web/20041212084718id_/http%3A//www.genesreunited.co.uk/genesreunited.asp?wci=unregister) and we will remove all Your Details. 

·         We provide Members with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving e-mailed Newsletters which they have previously opted to receive. This opt-out can be effected by making appropriate selections at Your Details. 

5.       **Disclosure for legal reasons**

We reserve the right to communicate such of a Member’s personal information, and family  as we hold to third parties which seek the disclosure of it, and which make a legally-compliant request for its disclosure.
