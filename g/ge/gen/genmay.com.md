## Information Collection & Use

General Mayhem, LLC is the sole owner of the information collected on GENMAY.COM. General Mayhem, LLC collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site. 

### Orders

If you purchase a product or service from us, at the time you add credit to your account and we charge your credit card, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, phone number and address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). 

When you enter your contact and financial information on our order form, we encrypt it using secure socket layer technology (SSL) both when you send this information to us, and when we send it to our credit card processor. 

We use this information for billing purposes. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. 

When placing an order, we record your internet protocol (IP) address for security purposes in the case of credit card fraud, and link the order to your user account on our Web site to apply the appropriate credits to your account. 

No information sold or distributed to third parties. 

### Customer Service

Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your orders.
