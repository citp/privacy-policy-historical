# Genome.gov | Website Privacy Policy

### Website Privacy Policy

#### Overview

Thank you for visiting the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) website, Genome.gov. Protecting your privacy is very important to us. Our website links to other NIH sites, federal agency sites, university/research institution sites and occasionally to private organizations. Once you leave Genome.gov, you are subject to the privacy policy for the site(s) you are visiting. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) about you during your visit unless you choose to provide it to us. 

We do, however, collect some data about your visit to our website to help us better understand how the public uses the site and how to make it more helpful. We collect information from visitors who read, browse and/or download information from our website. NHGRI never collects information for commercial marketing or any purpose unrelated to the NHGRI mission and goals.

#### Types of Information Collected

When you browse through any website, certain information about your visit can be collected. We automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:

  * The domain from which you access the Internet.
  * The IP Address (a number that is automatically assigned to a computer when surfing the Web).
  * The date and time of your visit.
  * The pages you visited.
  * The address of the website you came from when you arrived at our site (such as google.com or bing.com)
  * The keywords you may enter into our search engine.



We use this information to measure the number of visitors to our site and to help make our site more useful to visitors. 

#### Methods of Collecting Information

Genome.gov uses both the Webtrends Analytics and Google Analytics measurement software to collect information from the above list automatically and continuously. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to our site and its various sections and to distinguish between new and returning visitors to help make our site more useful to visitors. However, no personally identifiable information (PII) is collected.

NHGRI staff conducts analyses and reports on the aggregated data from Webtrends and Google Analytics. The reports are only available to NHGRI website managers, members of their Communications and Web Teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.

NHGRI retains the data from Webtrends and Google Analytics only as long as required by law or needed to support the mission of the NHGRI website.

#### Use of Cookies

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo [M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/asset.aspx?AssetId=2774) [whitehouse.gov] allows Federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies.

When you visit any website, its server may generate a piece of text known as a "cookie" to place on your computer. The cookie allows the server to "remember" specific information about your visit while you are connected.

The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of Web pages. Cookies from NHGRI Web pages only collect information about your browser's visit to the site. They do not collect personal information about you. There are two types of cookies: single session (temporary) and multi-session (persistent). Session cookies last only as long as your Web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods. 

> ##### Temporary (Session) Cookies
> 
> We use session cookies for technical purposes such as improving navigation through our site. These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our site. The "session" cookie is not permanently stored on your computer. The cookie and the information about your visit are automatically destroyed shortly after you close your browser to end the session.
> 
> The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as "Usage Tier 1—Single Session." The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of single session Web measurement and customization technologies."
> 
> NHGRI uses Google Analytics, which relies on session cookies, to track site usage for Genome.gov. However, no Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is collected.
> 
> ##### Persistent Cookies
> 
> **Genome.gov does not use persistent cookies**.
> 
> The OMB Memo M-10-22 Guidance allows Federal agencies to use persistent cookies, which remain on your computer between visits to a website until they expire. The Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as "Usage Tier 2 – Multi-session without Personally Identifiable Information (PII)." The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of multi-session Web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected."

#### Opting Out/Disabling Cookies

If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies placed on your computer, you can disable them using your Web browser. If you opt out of cookies, you will still have access to all information and resources on Genome.gov.
