### INFORMATION COLLECTION

I. Personally-identifiable information

These sites only collect personally-identifiable information from you if you choose to provide this information and to process a transaction that you requested. Personally-identifiable information collected with your consent may include, for example, name, e-mail address, resume information, or any inquires you may make through our websites. GIS only provides personally-identifiable information to third-parties in its normal course of business for two reasons: (1) in order to complete a transaction you requested, such as running a credit report through TransUnion, and (2) as required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to comply with the law or legal process.

### PERSONAL INFORMATION DISCLOSURE: UNITED STATES OR OVERSEAS

In preparing a consumer report or investigative consumer report, we only send information about the subject of the report outside the United States if our client asks for information from a jurisdiction outside the United States. For example, if a prospective employee worked outside of the United States, our client might ask for a criminal history report for the country in which the prospective employee worked. When we do this kind of report, we send enough information to identify the subject of the report.
