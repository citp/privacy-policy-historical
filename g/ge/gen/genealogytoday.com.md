Some of our services offer individuals the ability to publicly display certain personal information, such as a Team Roots member who wishes to publish research information as part of connecting with other members. The Team Roots member may use the delete function in the My Profile area to remove this information at any time. Participation in such services is always optional. 

In some cases, such as The Marketplace, businesses use our services to sell products and services to you on our sites. When required to complete a sales transaction, we share the requisite personal information you have provided us with these third parties. 

We accept online payments through the **[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/)** service, and use their shopping cart tools to allow our customers to combine multiple items into a single purchase. When you complete a purchase using Paypal, you are submitting your payment information to this company, and our access is limited to the information required to fullfil the order (e.g. name, address, products ordered). When using PayPal on our site, we DO NOT have access to your credit card information. Refer to their [privacy policy](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_privacy-outside) for additional details.

We support an affiliate program in conjunction with our marketplace, however, the affiliates are only permitted to view the order information (e.g. products and amounts charged) -- NOT the customer information. This information is presented to them in the form of summary reports. 

We also work closely with several affiliate businesses on special promotions. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. You may, however, be asked by these businesses to provide personal information in order to participate in the promotion. Please refer to the privacy policy of the affiliate business for details on how your personal information will be handled. 

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services. 

Genealogy Today LLC may disclose personal information if required to do so by law. We believe, in addition, it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our terms of use. 

### Control of your Personal Information

You can review, edit and remove the personal information and contact preferences you provided by visiting your Team Roots start page (login at <http://teamroots.com/> ). You will be asked to enter your userid and password before viewing your personal information. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

To have your information removed without joining, you may contact us by using [this form](https://web.archive.org/roots/xweb.mv?xc=Send.Message&xo=message&xn=-1&xd=1&xz=privacy.html). 

We also maintain a Do-Not-E-Mail Registry that gives users the option to not receive future communications from any of the sites owned by Genealogy Today LLC. To access this feature, visit [http://www.genealogytoday.com/info/register.html](https://web.archive.org/info/register.html) . Submitting your information to this registry will not prevent this site from sending automatic confirmation emails triggered by features and services you utilize (e.g. make a purchase, subscribe to a database). 

### Security of your Personal Information

Genealogy Today is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. 

We limit access to personal information about you to employees and contractors who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. 

Highly sensitive personal information, (e.g. credit card information) is never stored on our public servers, and is only retained offline for 18 months following your most recent sales transaction at which time it is shredded and discarded. Of course, we transmit the credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. 

### Protection of Children's Personal Information

The web sites owned by Genealogy Today LLC are general audience sites and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. 

The one exception is Genealogy Today, Jr. located at [http://www.genealogytoday.com/junior/](https://web.archive.org/junior/) , which does collect limited information from children. This area of our site includes additional features designed to protect the children that utilize our services. Additional information about these safeguards is published on the site for parents to review. Genealogy Today always recommends that children consult with their parents before submitting information online.
