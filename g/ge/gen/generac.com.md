## Collection Of Other Information

We and our service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:

**Through your browser or device**

Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Mac), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type, and version and the name and version of the Services (such as the App) you are using.  We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.

**Through your use of apps**

When you download and use apps, we and our service providers may track and collect app usage data, such as the date and time the app on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the app based on your device number.

**Cookies (or browser cookies) and web beacons**

A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer.  Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using.  Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the System, pages visited, language preferences, and other traffic data.  We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience.  We also gather statistical information about use of the System in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used, and assist us with resolving questions regarding them.  Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the System.  We may also use cookies or other technologies in online advertising to track responses to our ads.  We do not currently respond to browser do-not-track signals. 

 

You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html.  However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our System. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our System.

 

Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used to, among other things, track the actions of users of the System (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and compile statistics about usage of the System and response rates.

 

Generac uses industry standard web analytics to track web visits, Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics. The information generated by the cookie about your use of our System (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google and Adobe on servers in the United States. Google and Adobe will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our websites, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.  Google and Adobe may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s or Adobe’s behalf. 

You may opt out of web analytics by installing these tools on your computer:

**Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Shared Objects (“Flash LSOs”)) and other similar technologies  **

We may use Flash LSOs and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Services.  If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel.  You can also go to the Global Storage Settings Panel and follow the instructions (which may explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as “information”), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and  how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).  Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications. 

**IP Address​**

Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.  An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the System, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.  Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications, and other services.  We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems, and administering the System.  We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.

**Physical Location​**

We may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, or WiFi signals.  We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content.  We may also share your device’s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.  In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device’s location, but if you do, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.

## Data Integrity And Retention

Generac will take reasonable steps to confirm that Personal Information about you is accurate, complete, and up-to date.  We retain Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law.  The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:  

 

  * The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the System to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the System); 
  * Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or 
  * Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations).

## Data Security

 

Generac uses a variety of reasonable security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information and the System from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.  For example, we store the Personal Information you provide on computer systems with limited access that are located in facilities to which access is limited.  For sites to which you log in, it is your responsibility to ensure the security of your password and not to reveal this information to others.  When you move around a site to which you have logged in, or from one site to another that uses the same login mechanism, we verify your identity by means of an encrypted cookie placed on your machine.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Generac cannot guarantee that the System or your Personal Information cannot be compromised or hacked.  If you have specific security-related concerns, please contact our Customer Support.

We may use a third-party payment service to process payments made through the System.  If you wish to make a payment through the System, your Personal Information will be collected by such third party and not by us, and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Statement.  We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party’s collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information.

## Sensitive Information

Unless we request it, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the System or otherwise to us.
