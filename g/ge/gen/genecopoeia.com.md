# GeneCopoeia Privacy Practices


    Personal information
    At Genecopoeia,  we intend to give   you as much control  as possible  over your
    personal  information.   In  general,  you can  visit   Genecopoeia  on  the Web
    without telling us  who you  are  or revealing any  information  about yourself.
    There are times, however, when we  may need information from you,  such  as your
    name   and address.  It  is  our intent   to let  you  know  before we  collect
    personal information from you on the Internet. We do keep track of  the  domains
    from   which   people  visit   us.  We   analyze  this   data   for  trends  and
    statistics, and then we discard it. We have implemented these practices for  the
    Genecopoeia  Web  site.
    
    Information security and quality
    We intend to protect the quality and  integrity of your  personally identifiable
    information.  We   have   implemented   appropriate  technical   and  managerial
    procedures to maintain  information that is  accurate, current, and complete. We
    will make  a sincere  effort to  respond to  your requests  to correct  personal
    information inaccuracies in a timely manner.
    
    Business relationships
    The Genecopoeia  site  contains  links to  other Web   sites. Genecopoeia is not
    responsible for the privacy practices or the content of  such Web sites.
    
    Cookies
    There is a technology  called "cookies" which can  be used to provide   you with
    tailored information from a Web site. A cookie is an element of data that a  Web
