#### Your Rights and How to Exercise Them

We operate in countries with data protection laws that may provide individuals the right to access and control their information. We permit you to exercise those rights as provided by data protection laws.

EU data protection laws give individuals a number of rights concerning the processing of their data and information. These laws protect individuals in the EU where the website is made available to individuals in the EU, such as Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers and related companies’ websites. Under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) these include:

  * The right to confirm whether or not we have your personal data and, if we do, to obtain a copy of the personal information we hold. This is known as subject access request.
  * The right to have inaccurate data rectified
  * The right to request the restriction or suppression of your personal data, for example, we will stop using the data but we may continue storing it
  * The right to obtain your personal data that you have provided to us, on the basis of consent or performance of a transaction or contract, and where technically feasible, transmitted in a common electronic format to you or directly to another company
  * The right to object to the use of your data. Specifically, you have the right to object to our use for marketing and in relation to automated decision making, including profiling where there may be legal or similarly significant effects
  * The right to erasure of your personal information from the systems we control. This does not, however, apply where it is necessary for us to continue to use the data for a lawful reason. Click [here](https://web.archive.org/right-of-erasure) to access our right to erasure request form.



There are exceptions to the rights listed above. Where you make a request to us as part of these rights, we will always try to respond to your satisfaction, although there may be situations where we will be unable to do so. In some cases, we may be entitled to decline a request you have made regarding your personal information in accordance with applicable laws. We will explain if that is the case. Otherwise, we will meet your request as promptly as we reasonably can. If you have requested that we stop sending you marketing messages, please note that you may still receive them for a short period while the request is processed.

Depending on the laws of the country where you live, you may have other rights in respect of your personal information. If you wish to exercise any legal right in respect of your personal information, please contact us via one of the methods set out in the “Contact Us” below. 

##### How to update your information and marketing preferences

We want to ensure you remain in control of your personal information. We try to ensure that the personal information held about you is accurate and up-to-date, and will always give the opportunity to update and opt out of future communications.

You can customize and manage your communications preferences and other settings when you register for a user account, by logging into your user account and updating your account features and preferences, by using the unsubscribe and email preferences mechanisms within email messages, or by contacting us.

Information on how to opt out will be given when your personal information is collected and specified on every communication sent with the exception of notices related directly to purchases or customer service inquiries.

We take all steps necessary to ensure that any of your information which is passed is adequately protected and processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

#### Information Storage and Retention

We will only retain your personal information for as long as is necessary and as permitted by applicable laws.

We will retain your personal information while we are using it and may continue to retain it after these uses have ended where we have a legitimate business purpose. For example, if you have opted out of marketing communications from us, we will retain details about you to ensure the opt-out request is honored.
