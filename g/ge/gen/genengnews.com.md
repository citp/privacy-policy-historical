[Home ](http://www.genengnews.com/default.aspx)

This Privacy Statement is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use, and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our website and our products and services. Genetic Engineering News is committed to maintaining the privacy of clients and potential clients alike. Our relationships with our clients and potential clients are of the utmost importance; the trust we’ve developed with them is a paramount concern of ours. 

We collect two types of information from users of our website: (1) personal information you choose to disclose to us; and (2) aggregate information collected on users of our website. 

## Personal Information

You may be requested to provide personal information to us such as when you register with us, send an e-mail, or submit a résumé for review by us or through the GENcareers JobMart. GEN does not distribute email contact information. From time to time, we may provide select third-party distributors the opportunity to contact GEN subscribers, clients, site visitors, and those who have dealings with GEN or GEN products; such opportunities are only for direct mailings to physical addresses and never for electronic distribution. GEN may also contact you directly, by direct mail or email, to advise you of other GEN editorial products and events we believe may be of service to you, given products and/or services you currently receive. You may opt out of all such contact by updating your personal information in the log-in page on the GEN website, or by contacting us in writing.

When registering or otherwise providing required personal information, if you do not feel comfortable sharing information via our website, feel free to contact us via regular mail or telephone to submit the same information.

Our website may contain hyperlinks to sites controlled or maintained by independent third parties. We do not control the use of personal information provided to such third parties and such information will be governed by the applicable third party’s privacy policy.

## Aggregate Information

We may collect certain information about all users of our website such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address, the type of browser and operating system used, the date and time visited, and the pages visited. This information is captured for our usage in learning about our visitors, to help us continually improve your online experience with our firm.
