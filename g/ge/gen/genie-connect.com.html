</i>

<p>BY ACCESSING, USING OR
DOWNLOADING MATERIALS FROM THIS WEBSITE YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY
POLICY AND TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</p><i>

</i><p>If you do not agree with any
of the following, do not use this site or download any materials from it. If
you have any further questions about this Privacy Policy or its implementation,
please email via the contact page or write to us at our registered office,
details of which are at the bottom of this Policy. </p><i>

<p><b><i>What is this Privacy Policy for?</i></b></p>



</i><p>This privacy policy is for
this website <a href="http://www.genie-connect.com"><span>www.genie-connect.com</span></a> and served by GenieConnect Ltd and governs the privacy of its
users who choose to use it.</p>

<p>The policy sets out the
different areas where user privacy is concerned and outlines the obligations
and requirements of the users, the website and website owners. Furthermore the
way this website processes, stores and protects user data and information will
also be detailed within this policy.</p><i>

<p><b><i>The
Website</i></b></p>

</i><p>This website and its owners
take a proactive approach to user privacy and ensure the necessary steps are
taken to protect the privacy of its users throughout their visiting experience.
This website complies with all UK national laws and requirements for user
privacy.</p><i>

<p><b><i>Use of
Cookies</i></b></p>

</i><p>This website uses cookies to
better the user’s experience while visiting the website. Where applicable this
website uses a cookie control system allowing the user on their first visit to
the website to allow or disallow the use of cookies on their computer / device.
This complies with recent legislation requirements for websites to obtain explicit
consent from users before leaving behind or reading files such as cookies on a
user’s computer / device. Cookies are small files saved to the user’s
computer’s hard drive that track, save and store information about the user’s
interactions and usage of the website. This allows the website, through its
server to provide the users with a tailored experience within this website. 
Users are advised that if they wish to deny the use and saving of cookies from
this website on to their computer’s hard drive they should take necessary steps
within their web browser’s security settings to block all cookies from this
website and its external serving vendors. This website uses tracking software
to monitor its visitors to better understand how they use it. This software is
provided by Google Analytics which uses cookies to track visitor usage. The
software will save a cookie to your computer’s hard drive in order to track and
monitor your engagement and usage of the website but will not store, save or
collect personal information. You can read Google's privacy policy here for
further information <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents"><span>http://www.google.com/privacy.html</span></a>.</p>

<p>Other cookies may be stored
to your computer’s hard drive by external vendors when this website uses
referral programs, sponsored links or adverts. Such cookies are used for
conversion and referral tracking and typically expire after 30 days, though
some may take longer. No personal information is stored, saved or collected.</p><i>

</i><p>Most
web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your
browser options to block them in future. The Help portion of the toolbar on
most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new
cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or
how to disable cookies altogether.</p><i>

<p><b><i>Contact
&amp; Communication</i></b></p>

</i><p>Users contacting this website
and/or its owners do so at their own discretion and provide any such personal
details requested at their own risk. Your personal information is kept private
and stored securely until a time it is no longer required or has no use, as
detailed in the Data Protection Act 1998. Every effort has been made to ensure
a safe and secure form to email submission process but advise users using such
form to email processes that they do so at their own risk.</p>

<p>This website and its owners
use any information submitted to provide you with further information about the
products / services they offer or to assist you in answering any questions or
queries you may have submitted. This includes using your details to subscribe
you to any email newsletter program the website operates, but only if this was
made clear to you and your express permission was granted when submitting any
form to email process. It also includes instances whereby you the consumer have
previously purchased from or enquired about purchasing from the company a
product or service to which the email newsletter relates. This is by no means
an entire list of your user rights in regard to receiving email marketing
material. Your details are not passed on to any third parties.</p><i>

<p><b><i>Email
Newsletter</i></b></p>

</i><p>This website operates an
email newsletter program, used to inform customer &amp; subscribers about
products and services supplied by this website. Users can subscribe through an
online automated process should they wish to do so but do so at their own
discretion. Some subscriptions may be manually processed through prior written
agreement with the user.</p>

<p>Subscriptions are taken in
compliance with UK Spam Laws detailed in the Privacy and Electronic
Communications Regulations 2003. All personal details relating to subscriptions
are held securely and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. No
personal details are passed on to third parties nor shared with companies /
people outside of the company that operates this website. Under the Data
Protection Act 1998 you may request a copy of personal information held about
you by this website's email newsletter program. A small fee will be payable. If
you would like a copy of the information held on you please write to the
business address at the bottom of this policy.</p>

<p>Email marketing campaigns
published by this website or its owners may contain tracking facilities within
the actual email. Subscriber activity is tracked and stored in a database for
future analysis and evaluation. Such tracked activity may include: the opening
of emails, forwarding of emails, the clicking of links within the email
content, times, dates and frequency of activity [this is not a comprehensive
list]. This information is used to refine future email campaigns and supply the
user with more relevant content based around their activity.</p>

<p>In compliance with UK Spam
Laws and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 subscribers
are given the opportunity to un-subscribe at any time through an automated
system. This process is detailed at the footer of each email campaign. If an
automated un-subscription system is unavailable clear instructions on how to
un-subscribe will be detailed instead.</p><i>

<p><b><i>Security</i></b></p>

</i><p>GenieConnect protects secure
data with industry-standard firewall and password protection systems.
GenieConnect regularly reviews its security and privacy policies and makes
improvements as necessary. Only authorized individuals have access to
GenieConnect servers and information provided by this website’s users. </p><i>

<p><b><i>External
Links</i></b></p>

</i><p>Although this website only
looks to include quality, safe and relevant external links users should always
adopt a policy of caution before clicking any external web links mentioned
throughout this website.</p>

<p>The owners of this website
cannot guarantee or verify the contents of any externally linked website
despite their best efforts. Users should therefore note they click on external
links at their own risk and this website and its owners cannot be held liable
for any damages or implications caused by visiting any external links
mentioned.</p><i>

<p><b><i>Adverts
and Sponsored Links</i></b></p>

</i><p>This website may contain
sponsored links and adverts. These will typically be served through our
advertising partners, who may have detailed privacy policies relating directly
to the adverts they serve.</p>

<p>Clicking on any such adverts
will send you to the advertiser’s website through a referral program which may
use cookies and will track the number of referrals sent from this website. This
may include the use of cookies which may in turn be saved on your computer’s
hard drive. Users should therefore note they click on sponsored external links
at their own risk and this website and its owners cannot be held liable for any
damages or implications caused by visiting any external links mentioned.</p><i>

<p><b><i>Social
Media Platforms</i></b></p>

</i><p>Communication, engagement and
actions taken through external social media platforms that this website and its
owners participate on are custom to the terms and conditions as well as the
privacy policies held with each social media platform respectively.</p>

<p>Users are advised to use
social media platforms wisely and communicate / engage upon them with due care
and caution in regard to their own privacy and personal details. Neither this
website nor its owners will ever ask for personal or sensitive information
through social media platforms and users wishing to discuss sensitive details
are encouraged to contact them through primary communication channels such as
by telephone or email.</p>

<p>This website may use social
sharing buttons which help share web content directly from web pages to the
social media platform in question. Users are advised before using such social
sharing buttons that they do so at their own discretion and note that the
social media platform may track and save your request to share a web page
respectively through your social media platform account.</p><i>

<p><b><i>Shortened
Links in Social Media</i></b></p>

</i><p>This website and its owners
through their social media platform accounts may share web links to relevant
web pages. By default some social media platforms shorten lengthy URL's (this
is an example of a shortened URL: <a href="http://bit.ly/zyVUBo)."><span>http://bit.ly/zyVUBo).</span></a></p>

<p>Users are advised to take
caution and good judgement before clicking any shortened URL's published on
social media platforms by this website and its owners. Despite the best efforts
to ensure only genuine URL's are published many social media platforms are
prone to spam and hacking and therefore this website and its owners cannot be
held liable for any damages or implications caused by visiting any shortened
links.</p><i>
