We reserve the right to use anonymous or aggregated data for any purpose, including, but not limited to, those set forth above. We may also disclose such anonymous aggregate information to our partners or third-party service providers, excluding any Personal Information, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.

**FAILURE TO PROVIDE REQUIRED PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Where we are required to collect certain Personal Information by law or under the terms of a contract with you or your employer or prospective employer, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform under the respective contract and may not be able to provide access to or use of the Services.  In the situation where we have already entered into a contract with you, we may be required to cancel provision of the Services, but we will notify you in advance of such cancelation if this is the case.

We collect this information by using cookies, server logs, and other similar technology. See below for more information on our use of cookies.

**COOKIES, AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES**

When you visit the Site or use the Services, we and our third-party service providers, which may include third-party analytics service providers and third-party advertisers, may use cookies, server logs and other similar technology to collect and store your preferences, usage statistics, website traffic and performance data, as well as other information such as your IP address, the type of Internet browser or device you use, any website you have come to the Site or Services from and your operating system. We may also receive Personal Information about you from various third parties and public sources.

Cookies are small text files that include a unique reference code placed on a visitors' device to store their preferences and sometimes track information. A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to our Site or Services and will last for longer. Some cookies are necessary to enable you to move around the Site and use the Services such as accessing the secure areas of the Site, and they enable us to provide you with the Services you have requested. “Performance cookies” collect aggregated, anonymous, statistical information on how visitors use our Site and Services. We use this information to make improvements to the Site and our Services and to enhance your overall experience. Other cookies, called “functionality cookies,” allow the Site and Services to remember choices you make such as your user name when you log in to your account or the language or region you are in. They may also be used to help you watch a video or comment on a blog and are intended to improve your online experience.

We and our third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies to gather information about the pages visited through our advertising partners, both on our Site as well as other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a "market segment." This information is then used by us and our third-party vendors to serve interest-based advertisements when you visit our Site and other websites and our third party vendors will combine it with other information from your visits to other websites and apps to learn more about your interests. For more information about this type of interest based advertising, and about how to opt-out of the automated collection of information by third-party ad networks, please visit the consumer opt-out page for the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>. Without these cookies, advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and to your interests.

We also use Google Analytics Advertising Features including Google Analytics Remarketing to advertise across websites, Demographics and Interest Reporting and AdWords and AdSense integrations to collect data about our Site traffic via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers. We do not facilitate the merging of personal information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected through any Google advertising product. Google may serve ads across other websites that you visit based upon your past visits to our Site, and may also serve our advertisements on other websites. Site visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ad Settings found at <https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads?hl=en>. You can also opt-out of Google Analytics tracking with the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on found at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>.

In addition to cookies, we use the following similar technologies:

  * **Pixel Gifs/web beacons:** These are small image files that may be placed by us or third parties on the Site or Services, or within the body of our newsletters so we or third parties can understand which parts of the Site and Services are visited or whether particular content is of interest.
  * **Flash cookies:** We do not serve Flash cookies but Adobe Flash Player may be used by third parties serving advertisements to the Site in cases where these advertisements are served with flash related content. It is not possible to block or restrict or block flash cookies using your browser setting, however information on how to do this is available from the Adobe website at: <http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security>.

**CHANGE OF PURPOSE**

We will only use your Personal Information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.  If you would like an explanation as to how the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us at [privacy@ga.co](mailto:privacy@ga.co).  If we need to use your Personal Information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and will explain the legal basis which allows us to do this.

**NOTICE TO JOB APPLICANTS**

When you apply for a job posted on our Site, we may collect the personal information that you voluntarily submit to us, including, but not limited to: name, personal email address, telephone number, postal address, education, employment history and any other information included in a resume, cover letter or personal LinkedIn profile, gender, race or ethnic origin, veteran status, disability status and information relating to references. We do not request your details of race or ethnic origin or your disability status and it will not affect your application in any way if you do not provide it.  Where you do provide it we will use only as permitted by law for the purposes of diversity and equal opportunity monitoring. If you provide us with the details of a reference as part of your resume, it is your responsibility to obtain such third party’s consent prior to submitting their information to us. The personal information that you submit in connection with a job application will be used by General Assembly in accordance with this Privacy Policy and may be used for the following purposes: to evaluate your capabilities and qualifications for a job; to conduct reference checks; and to clear conflicts of interest and conduct background checks, if applicable and where applicable law allows. If you become an employee or contractor, any Personal Information you submit will become a part of your file and may be used for other employment/work related purposes.

If you are located outside of the United States, please note that the Personal Information that you submit will be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States (and may also be stored in the relevant jurisdiction(s), as required by applicable law, if the job relates to one of our affiliated entities outside of the United States), and you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your information in the United States. To the extent your Personal Information contains details of your race or ethnic origin or physical or mental health or condition, you expressly consent to the collection, storage and processing of this information for the purposes of your job application.

**HOW TO OPT OUT OF FUTURE COMMUNICATIONS**

If you do not want us to contact you with marketing communications or other information regarding our products and services (or if you agreed to be contacted for such purposes at the point Personal Information was collected by us but you no longer wish to be contacted or have your information used in such way), you can let us know by following the unsubscribe instructions on any communications sent to you. You can also unsubscribe at any time by contacting us at [hello@ga.co](mailto:hello@ga.co).

Please note that if you have registered an account on the Site or Services or are registered for

a Course, opting out of receiving marketing messages will not apply to Personal Information provided to us as a result of signing up to use our Site or Services, and we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your account, your registration, and your use of the Site and Services, such as messages relating to account management, customer service and system maintenance.  These transactional account messages will thus be unaffected if you choose to opt-out of marketing communications.

**NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS**

We do not rent, sell or share Personal Information about you with third parties who are not our partners or affiliates for their own direct marketing purposes unless you have opted-in to such a disclosure or were offered the opportunity to opt-out of such a disclosure at the time you provided your Personal Information and elected not to opt-out.

In addition, California residents are entitled to know that third parties may collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you visit our Site. For additional information about this, please refer to the section entitled "Cookies, Automatic Data Collection and Related Technologies."

**“Do Not Track” Signals:**  Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is currently no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals.  Therfore, our Site, like many others, may not respond to “do not track” signals.

**HOW GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY SHARE YOUR INFORMATION**

**Vendors and Third-Party Service Providers**. We may share any information we receive, including your Personal Information, with vendors and third-party service providers, including Instructors, retained in connection with the provision of the Site or Services. This includes those providing website and data hosting services (e.g., Amazon Web Services and Heroku), distributing communications and supporting or updating marketing lists (e.g., Sailthru and Salesforce), facilitating feedback on our services (e.g., SurveyMonkey); and providing IT support services from time to time. These organizations (which may include third-party suppliers, agents, subcontractors, and/or other companies in our group) will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform their support functions. In addition, where necessary, we have entered into Data Processing Agreements with these third-party service providers. 

**Payment Transactions.**  All payment transactions are conducted through our PCI compliant secure payment solutions provider Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc. For additional information on how Braintree secures your payment card information during transmission and storage, please refer to Braintree's privacy policy located at: <https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full>.  You will be providing debit or credit card information directly to our payment solutions provider that operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorizing payment. Information that you supply to our payment solutions provider is not stored by us or within our control, and is subject to our payment solutions provider's own privacy policy and terms and conditions.

**Events and Partnerships**.  From time to time, we may partner with other organizations to run events. If you register for an event on our Site and we indicate on our Site that the event is in partnership with or sponsored by another organization, in circumstances where either you agreed to be contacted by marketing communications at the time we collected your information or where we are otherwise permitted by local law to contact you for marketing purposes, your email address may be available to that organization and you may receive emails from them after the event.  Please refer to that organization’s privacy policy for information on how to opt-out of their communications should you receive an email from them but no longer wish to be contacted by them.

**Displaying to Other Users**.  Some content that you post to the Site or Services may be displayed publicly. Other users of the Site or Services may be able to see some information about you, such as information contained in comments posted in a chat room or on a blog post. You should exercise caution when using public forums. We discourage the posting of sensitive or Personal Information in comments or posts to the Site and/or Services and we are not responsible for the use of any Personal Information by third parties that you publicly post on the Site or Services.

**Social Networking and Other Websites**. The Site or Services may allow you to post information to social networking websites. We do not share your information with such social networking website unless you direct the Site or Services to share it. The use of the information by such social networking websites will be governed by their privacy policies, and we do not control their use of the shared data.

**As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures**.  We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, other account information, usage information and device identifier (including IP address), and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order, warrant or subpoena; respond to your requests; enforce our policies related to our Site or Services, or other applicable policies; or protect your, our, or others' rights, property, or safety. Unless prohibited by law or court order, or unless we determine in our sole discretion that notification is inappropriate under the circumstances, we will take all reasonable steps to notify all affected users of a legal request for information or intended disclosure prior to disclosure.

**Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers**. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information, including Personal Information, may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as one of the transferred assets as permitted by law and/or contract.  We cannot control how such entities may use or disclose such information.

**With Your Consent**. We may also disclose your information, including your Personal Information, where you have specifically provided your consent for the disclosure.  You may withdraw consent to disclosures where you have previously give a specific consent by emailing us at [privacy@ga.co](mailto:privacy@ga.co).

**SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We have implemented appropriate physical, technical and administrative measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. In addition, we limit access to your Personal Information to only those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who need to have access to such information for the operation of our business, including operation of the Site and Services.  They will only process your Personal Information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

As noted above, all payment transactions are conducted through our PCI compliant secure payment solutions provider Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc. For additional information on how Braintree secures your payment card information during transmission and storage, please refer to Braintree's privacy policy located at: <https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full>.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Site or the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Site or the Services like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Site or the Services.

Unfortunately, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be completely secure or error free and we cannot warrant or guarantee the security of any Personal Information transmitted to our Site or Services. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk.

**CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**

Our Site and the Services are not intended for nor directed toward children under the age of 16 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16 years of age. If you believe that your child under the age of 16 may have provided us with Personal Information without your consent, you may alert us at [privacy@ga.co](mailto:privacy@ga.co).  If we learn that we have inadvertently collected any Personal Information from children under 16, we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the child's account.

The Site or Services may, from time to time, contain links to external websites. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We have no control over these third parties and we are not responsible for the content of such websites or for the privacy policies or practices of such third parties.

**DATA RETENTION**

We will only keep your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

**YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS**

Under the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the GDPR), data subjects located in the EU have the right under certain circumstances to:

  * Be provided with a copy of your Personal Information held by us;
  * Request that we correct any of your Personal Information held by us;
  * Request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Information (while we verify or investigate your concerns with this information, for example); and
  * Object to any further processing of your Personal Information, including the right to object to marketing;
  * Request that the Personal Information you have provided be transferred to a third party;
  * Withdraw consent: where the basis of the processing of your Personal Information is based on consent you have the right to withdraw that consent without detriment at any time.
  * Request that we delete any of your Personal Information held by us.



To exercise any of the rights outlined above, please email us at [privacy@ga.co](mailto:privacy@ga.co).

You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any other rights).  We may, however, charge a fee if we believe your request is excessive, unfounded or repetitive.  Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

In response to any of the requests outlined above, we may need to request specific information from you to enable us to confirm your identity and to ensure you have the right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights).  This is a security measure to ensure that your Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who does not have the right to receive it.  We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request in order to speed up our response time.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.  Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.  In this case we will notify you and keep you updated.

If your request or concern is not satisfactorily resolved by us and you are located in the EU, you may approach your local data protection authority (see [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index en.html](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index%20en.html)) who can provide further information about your rights and our obligations in relation to your Personal Information, as well as deal with any complaints that you have about our processing of your Personal Information.

**UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION OR POSE A QUESTION OR SUGGESTION**
