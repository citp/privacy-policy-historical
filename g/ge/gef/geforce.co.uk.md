# NVIDIA Privacy Policy|NVIDIA UK

**This policy was last updated on June 15, 2016.**

NVIDIA is committed to respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to our world-wide family of NVIDIA-operated websites (including www.nvidia.com, www.slizone.com, 3DVision Live, GeForce.com, GTC, TegraZone.com, and shield.nvidia.com) and mobile apps and hardware and software products including any internet-connected devices (our “Services”).

#### 1\. Introduction

NVIDIA is committed to implementing appropriate protections for any Personal Information that we collect or our users share with us.

NVIDIA's Online Privacy Policy and Kids Privacy Policy set forth our policies and procedures regarding our collection, use, and/or sharing of your Personal Information.

Please note: The NVIDIA Online Store is managed independently by Digital River, Inc., and is subject exclusively to the Digital River Privacy Statement.

#### 2\. What Information We May Collect

When you use our Services, we may collect "Personal information," which is any information that can be used to identify a particular individual which can include traditional identifiers such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and non-traditional identifiers such as unique device identifiers and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

We may collect personal information that you or other users give us (e.g. your contact details or your comments or opinions), allow us to receive either through your preferences in your devices (e.g. location data) or browser or from third parties such as social networks (e.g. your public profile information) or through use of our Services (e.g. the pages you visit).

We collect Personal Information about our users in several ways.

 **Personal Information You Provide to Us**

Most of the Personal Information we receive comes to us voluntarily from our users in the course of using our Services. For example, Personal Information may be collected when you:

  * Register or log in to our Services;
  * Participate in activities available through our Services such as a sweepstakes, contests, games and promotional offers;
  * Sign up for a newsletter;
  * Provide information to our customer service representatives or contact us through our Services;
  * Use our message boards and other public forums available through our Services;
  * Use any social networking features available through our Services and create a profile or share information about yourself;
  * Apply for employment or a position online.



**Personal Information Collected Via Technology**

As you use our Services, we may collect passive information through the use of cookies, web beacons, log file information and other tracking technologies, including your IP address, browser type, device type, device ID, geolocation data, Uniform Resource Locators (URL) and operating system 

We use this technology and identifiers to better understand how you interact with our Services. In particular, we gather information on the date and time you connect or engage with our Services, the products you reviewed, the areas of our Services you interact with any referring or destination pages or websites. 

This information allows us to better understand our users and to enhance your experience. For example, when you return to our website after visiting another site, cookies allow our website to remember who you are and any preferences you have. For more information on who we use cookies, please see our cookie policy. 

In addition, collecting information such as device type allows us to optimize settings for your system remotely.

**Personal Information We Receive From Others**

We may receive Personal Information about users from third parties such as web analytics vendors, social media sites, law enforcement agencies and marketing consultants.

This information supplements any information that we have collected directly from our users, and allows us to customize our Services to better serve you. Sometimes, we may receive Personal Information about people who are not yet users of our Services. NVIDIA's policy is to treat all information obtained from third parties in the same manner that we treat information that we have collected ourselves.

#### 3\. Why We Collect Personal Information

The Personal Information we collect helps us.

  * provide our Services to you;
  * process transactions; 
  * respond to requests or any correspondence you send us;
  * and learn about our users' interests in terms of the features, performance and support of our products;
  * customize your experience (including the content and advertisements delivered on our websites);
  * to enhance and develop our Services;
  * to protect and enforce our rights and the rights of our users and third parties;
  * market our products and services to you through newsletters or promotional e-mails or push notifications (Please see the section below on Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information.)



#### 4\. How We May Share Your Information 

We do not sell Personal Information about our customers or users to any third parties. We may from time to time share your Personal Information with our business partners, resellers, affiliates, service providers, consulting partners and others in order to provide our Services to you. 

[CLICK HERE]to learn more how we may share your Personal Information with our business partners and others. For further information on your choices regarding your information, see the “Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information” section below.

Any Personal Information we collect may be shared with NVIDIA's corporate affiliates, or companies who operate under the same corporate control. NVIDIA will take reasonable steps to ensure that these company affiliates honor this Online Privacy Policy and Kids Privacy Policy.

We may, from time to time, share your Personal Information with third party business partners, vendors, affiliates, and other service providers that perform services on our behalf, in order to carry out their work for us, which may include identifying and serving targeted advertisements, e-commerce, content or service fulfillment, website operations, email communications management, customer service, analytics, manufacturing, integration, delivery, support, payment, and servicing processes. NVIDIA's policy is to prohibit these companies from using your Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide the services expressly requested by NVIDIA.

We may with your prior consent share your Personal Information with business partners who offer a service jointly with us, for example, when running a co-sponsored contest or promotion, or offering a co-branded product or service.

NVIDIA may sell or buy assets from or to other companies. Personal information may be one of the transferred business assets, and would likely be one of the transferred assets in the event that NVIDIA or some of its assets were acquired. If NVIDIA or its assets are acquired by another company, NVIDIA will request that the acquiring company assumes the obligations of this Online Privacy Policy and Kids Privacy Policy.

We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on NVIDIA; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of NVIDIA or users of our website.

NVIDIA may "de-personalize" Personal Information by removing personally identifiable characteristics, such as name and email address, and aggregate data for use in surveys or other business purposes. NVIDIA may then use and/or share this de-personalized information with third parties to improve our Services.

#### 5\. Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information

NVIDIA respects your choices about how your Personal Information is used when you register with us, elect to receive our newsletters, or provide us with Personal Information for other purposes.

This information is used to display targeted ads on or through our Services, or to our users or visitors to our websites on other websites or apps, including on Facebook. We may combine personal information that we collect about you with the browsing and tracking information collected by these technologies. We or the online advertising networks use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests.

You may be able to “opt out” of the collection of information through cookies or other tracking technology by actively managing the settings on your browser or mobile device. Please refer to your browser’s or mobile device’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools.
