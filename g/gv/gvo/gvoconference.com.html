	<p><font face="Tahoma"><strong>POLICY IS PART OF OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE</strong></font></p>
	<p><font face="Tahoma">Our privacy policy is part of, and subject to, our website's terms and conditions of use. You may view these terms and conditions on our website.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Tahoma"><strong>THE TYPE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</strong></font></p>
	<p><font face="Tahoma">Like most places on the Internet, simply by visiting our website you automatically tell us certain information. This includes basic information such as your IP address, when you visited, the website from where you came prior to visiting us, the website where you go when you leave our website, your computer's operating system, and the type of web browser that you are using. Our website automatically records this basic information about you.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Tahoma">And like many other websites, we may use cookies. In plain English, this means information that our website's server transfers to your computer. This information can be used to track your session on our website. Cookies may also be used to customize our website content for you as an individual. If you are using one of the common Internet web browsers, you can set up your browser to either let you know when you receive a cookie or to deny cookie access to your computer.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Tahoma">We may also collect any data that you provide us by posting it at our website or by e-mail. You can always choose not to provide us with information. However, if you do withhold information, we may deny you access to some or all of our website's services and features.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Tahoma">Some transactions between you and our website may involve payment by credit card, debit card, checks, money orders, and/or third party online payment services. In such transactions, we will collect information related to the transaction as part of the course of doing business with you, including your billing address, telephone number, and other information related to the transaction.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Tahoma"><strong>WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION</strong></font></p>
	<p><font face="Tahoma">We use your information to operate our website's business activities.

	<p><font face="Tahoma">If you obtain personally identifiable information about another website user, you are not allowed to disclose this information to anyone else without the consent of the user and our consent too.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Tahoma">We hate junk e-mail (Spam).
