                cookies associated with this Site or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us.
How we use information that we collect
We use personal information to manage and operate our business, including to explore new
investment opportunities, manage our existing portfolio, develop and maintain our contacts and
recruit staff. Where necessary, we may also use personal information to protect the interests of
GV, our employees and affiliates (for example in the event of a legal claim).


When you ​contact us​, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you
might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our business, such as
letting you know about upcoming events or changes to our business.
We use the information we collect from our Site to provide, maintain, protect and improve it and
to protect our users. We may use information collected from cookies and other technologies to
improve your user experience and the overall quality of our Site.
Our legal basis for processing your personal information
If EU data protection law applies to our processing of your personal information, it is important
that you know the lawful basis on which we process your personal information.
We rely on the following legal basis, under EU data protection law, to process your personal
data:
     ●   Where we have obtained your consent, for example to action a request from you or
         respond to your specific query. You can withdraw your consent at any time, but we may
         still need to retain a record of your correspondence with us.
     ●   Where it is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests to manage our existing
         investments and explore new investment opportunities, including conducting legal and
         commercial due diligence.
     ●   Where it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, for example under anti-money
         laundering or anti-bribery legislation.
Transfer of personal information
GV is headquartered in the US, with an office in the UK. Consequently, any information we
collect will be transferred to, and stored in, the US and other countries where the data protection
laws may offer a lower standard of protection than in your country of residence. Where personal
information is transferred outside the EEA, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to
ensure that it is subject to appropriate safeguards and that it is treated securely and in
accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Adhesion to the Privacy Shield Frameworks
GV Management Company, L.L.C. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it
adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. We comply with the EU-U.S and Swiss-US Privacy
Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection,


use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and
Switzerland to the United States, respectively. If there is any conflict between the terms in this
Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To
learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
Accountability for onward transfers
We are responsible and remain liable for the processing of personal information we receive,
under the Privacy Shield Frameworks, including if we subsequently transfer to a third party
acting as an agent on its behalf. We comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward
transfers of personal information from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer
liability provisions.
With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield
Frameworks, we are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in
response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law
enforcement requirements.
Resolution of Privacy Shield queries and complaint mechanism
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, We commit to resolve complaints about our
collection or use of your personal information. European Economic Area and Swiss individuals
with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first ​contact us​.
We have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS. If you do not
receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your
complaint, please contact or visit ​https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield or to file a
complaint visit ​https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim​. The
services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you. As further explained in the Privacy Shield
Principles, a binding arbitration option may also be made available to you in order to address
residual complaints not resolved by any other means.
We commit to cooperate with the EU DPA panel established by the EU data protection
authorities ("EU DPA panel") and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information
Commissioner (as applicable) and to comply with the advice given such EU DPA panel and/or
the Swiss Commissioner (as applicable) with regard to human resources data transferred from
the EU DPA and/or Switzerland to GV Management Company, L.L.C. in the context of the
employment relationship.


Enforcement
GV is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission. GV may be required to share your personal information, including the disclosure
of EU and Swiss personal information, to public authorities and law enforcement agencies in
response to lawful requests, including requests to meet national security and law enforcement
requirements.
Accessing and updating your personal information
If you are resident in the European Economic Area and/or your personal information is
processed in the context of our UK office, you have certain legal rights in respect of the
personal information about you held by us. This includes the right to obtain a copy of this
information on request, and the right to correct, amend or delete such personal information or
object to it being used for certain purposes (including marketing). We may ask you to verify
your identity before we can act on your request.
We will comply with any requests to exercise your rights in accordance with applicable law, and
so there may be circumstances where we are entitled to refuse your request. For example,
where permitted to by law, we may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require
disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally
changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for
instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).
Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so free of charge, except
where it would require a disproportionate effort (where we are permitted to charge a fee under
applicable law). We aim to maintain any information we hold and our Site in a manner that
protects information from accidental or malicious destruction.
To make any requests regarding your personal information, or if you have any questions or
concerns regarding your personal information, you should contact us using the details below.
You are also entitled to contact your local supervisory authority for data protection. In the UK,
the data protection authority is the Information Commissioner’s Office.
Information that we share
We share personal information with companies, organisations and individuals outside of GV in
the following circumstances:


    ●    ​With  your consent
        We may share personal information with companies, organisations or individuals outside
        GV when we have your consent to do so.
    ●   For external processing
        We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons
        to process it for us (or for similar reasons), based on our instructions and in compliance
        with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
    ●     ​With our legal and professional advisors
        We share information with our legal and other professional advisors, for example if they
        are advising us on an investment transaction or where otherwise necessary to obtain
        their advice.
    ●   For legal reasons
        We may share personal information with companies, organisations or individuals outside
        GV if we have a belief in good faith that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the
        information is reasonably necessary to:
                     ●  meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable
                        governmental request​.
                     ●  enforce applicable terms of service, including investigation of potential
                        violations.
                     ●  detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
                     ●  protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of GV, our users or
                        the public, as required or permitted by law.
If GV is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale of GV, we will use reasonable
endeavours to ensure the personal information we process continues to be subject to the same
protections set out in this Privacy Policy.
Information security
We work hard to protect our Site and any information that we hold from unauthorized access or
unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction. In particular:
              ●  We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including
                 physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.


            ●  We restrict access to personal information to GV employees, contractors, service
               providers and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for
               us and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations. They may
               be disciplined or their contract terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
When this Privacy Policy applies
Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered and businesses operated by GV, but
excludes services and businesses that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate
this Privacy Policy.
Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered or businesses operated by other
companies or individuals. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other
companies and organisations that advertise our services and that may use cookies, pixel tags
and other technologies.

this page and, if deemed necessary, we will provide a more prominent notice.
