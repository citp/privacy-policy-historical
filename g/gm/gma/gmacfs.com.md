### Do you use cookies or other online technologies to collect information about me?

When you browse or visit one of our websites, we may store certain information on your computer. This information may be in the form of a small text file called a "cookie" and can help us to tailor our sites to your individual preferences and save you time if you visit the site again. For example, cookies may include the country webpage you prefer or your language preference. Where specific programs associated with our websites require a user ID and password, you have the option of requesting that we save your user ID and password so that you will not have to re-enter that information the next time you access the website. This is accomplished by the placement of a cookie on your computer.

We may also use cookie technology or other online tracking technologies, like web beacons, to gather anonymous, aggregate information about your visit to our websites. This information allows us to measure site activity and to create ideas for improving our sites and may include the time and length of your visit, the web pages you look at on our sites, the website you visited just before coming to ours and your internet service provider. If we provide you a link from an Ally Financial site to another site, we may track the fact that you navigated to that other site from ours, and we may track your activity while on that site. This will help us understand which links are helpful to you when you visit our site, and will help us provide you with links that may be of interest to you, when you visit our site again.

You can disallow cookies by making the appropriate selection from your browser options to inform you when cookies are set or to prevent cookies from being set. However, if you set your browser options to disallow cookies, you may limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our site.
