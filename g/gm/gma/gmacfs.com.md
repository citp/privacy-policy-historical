### Does Ally Financial use cookies or other online technologies to collect information?

When you browse or visit one of our websites, we may store certain information on your computer.

This information allows us to measure site activity and to create ideas for improving our sites and may include the time and length of your visit, the pages you look at on our sites, the website you visited just before coming to ours and your internet service provider. If we provide you with a link from an Ally Financial site to another site, we may track the fact that you clicked the link.
