This helps us provide more relevant online and offline information including, custom content and recommended products and services tailored to your interests.

  * Does Ally use online behavioral advertising (OBA) on third party sites?

There are two ways we use OBA on third party websites and mobile apps that are not affiliated with Ally.

**Interest‐Based Advertising**   
The third parties we contract with may use cookies or other technologies to gather interest-based information to customize the ads you see. Neither the third parties nor Ally collects any personally identifiable information (PII) through these cookies. We may also use aggregate data to display ads or content that may interest you.

Ally has adopted the use of the [AdChoices Icon](http://www.youradchoices.com/) (also known as the Advertising Option Icon) on our interest-based advertising (excluding ads appearing on platforms that do not accept the icon). You can click the AdChoices Icon to learn more and control whether or not you receive this type of advertising from participating companies.

**Device-Based Advertising**   
We also use device information, particularly in mobile advertising, to help deliver our ads and measure ad campaign effectiveness. Ally and the companies we work with won’t collect any personally identifiable information (PII) but may collect your device information when you visit one of our sites or see our ads. Compiling and comparing this information creates a unique ID for individual devices and can be "matched" to the same information on other sites or mobile applications. Some companies we work with are also able to associate related devices into households based on common characteristics, such as IP addresses.

  * How do your websites respond to web browser "Do Not Track" signals?

We do not respond to Web browser "Do Not Track" signals at this time. To prevent Ally or third parties from tracking, you can access your browser settings and disable or delete your cookies.
