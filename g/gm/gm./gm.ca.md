To measure site activity, provide a better user experience, and tailor our marketing communications, we or our service providers or business partners may compile information from the cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other tracking technologies on our websites. This information may be combined with other information collected online or offline about you, including data provided by third party sources, and may be used or shared for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

To the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we treat these identifiers and associated information as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

At this time, we do not honor "do no track" signals from a web site browser. However, you may refuse or delete cookies. Please refer to your browser Help instructions to learn more about cookies and other technologies and how to manage their use. If you elect to refuse or delete cookies, you will need to repeat this process if you use another computer, or change browsers. If you choose to decline cookies, some of the functionality of a website may be impaired.

**INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING**

We work with third party advertising networks and other advertising and personalization partners that use their own tracking technologies (including cookies and pixel tags) on GM and non-GM websites and apps in order to provide you with tailored advertisements on our behalf across the Internet (including on social networking websites and apps). These companies may collect information about your activity over time and across your different devices on GM and non-GM websites and apps (such as web pages you visit and your interaction with our advertising and other communications) and use this information to make predictions about your preferences, develop personalized content and deliver ads that are more relevant to you on third party websites and apps. This information may also be used to evaluate our online advertising campaigns or to tailor promotions or other marketing messages to you across your devices.

GM adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising ([www.youradchoices.ca](https://youradchoices.ca/)). If you do not wish to receive personalized advertising or content from participating third-party advertising companies while visiting GM web sites, you may click on the AdChoices icon or link located on the web site or visit the [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada's Opt-Out page](https://youradchoices.ca/choices/). If you do not wish to receive personalized advertising or content from participating third-party advertising companies on non-GM websites, please visit the [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada's Opt-Out page](https://youradchoices.ca/choices/) or click on the AdChoices icon on a GM advertisement and follow the instructions on how to opt out.

Opting out of relevant advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only those advertisements that are personalized to your interests by GM or its service providers.

To successfully opt-out, you must have cookies enabled in your web browser. Please see your browser's instructions for information on cookies and how to enable them. Your opt-out only applies to the web browser you use so you must opt-out of each web browser on each device that you use. Once you opt out, if you delete your browser's saved cookies, you may need to opt-out again.

We may also use services provided by third-party platforms (such as social networking and other websites) to serve targeted advertisements on such platforms to you or others, and we may provide a hashed version of your email address or other information to the platform provider for such purposes. To opt-out of the use of your information for such purposes, please contact our customer care center at 1-800-GM-DRIVE ([1 800 463-7483](tel:1-800-463-7483)).

**GM DEALERS**

GM and GM dealers are separate legal entities with their own privacy practices. For questions about your dealer's privacy practices including opting out of marketing communications from your dealer, please contact your dealer directly.

When you buy or lease a vehicle from a GM dealer, the dealer will share your information with GM. Please be aware that each dealer operates as a separate legal entity and you should read the dealer's privacy statement to ensure that you understand its privacy practices and procedures. Additionally, because the GM dealer often is the first contact with you, the dealer can answer any questions you may have about its privacy practices. While GM encourages its dealers to ensure full compliance with all applicable privacy legislation and has provided information to our dealers relating to privacy obligations, GM is not responsible for dealers' compliance with applicable law.

When completing a purchase or lease agreement or signing a service repair order with the GM dealer, you should be provided with information describing the dealership's privacy practices and related policies that explain that certain personal information that you provide to the dealer may be shared with GM for some or all of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

**HOW WE SAFEGUARD YOUR INFORMATION**

We maintain reasonable and adequate technical, administrative, and physical security and confidentiality measures designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access or acquisition. We also require by contract that third party services providers acting on our behalf or with whom we share your information also undertake to provide such security and confidentiality measures in accordance with industry standards.

**HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION**

We may keep the information we collect for as long as necessary to provide products or services to you, to operate our business, to enable us to communicate with you, for our safety, research, evaluation of use, or troubleshooting purposes, or to satisfy our legal or contractual obligations. Where required, we will anonymize or dispose of the information we collect when we no longer need it for the uses described above.
