# GMI Privacy Policy

GMI is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically.

GMI adheres to the principles set forth in the Safe Harbor framework as established by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information provided to GMI from the European Union. 

### What personally identifiable information does GMI collect from me?

GMI collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of websites. Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, GMI asks for your name, email address, zip code, household information and personal interests. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to GMI - you are given a account number which you will use access the various protected areas of the site. Also, if you contact GMI we may keep a record of that correspondence. Wherever GMI collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.

### What are cookies and how does GMI use them?

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, GMI may use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Some areas on GMI where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable may require that you accept cookies. This avoids you having to enter your login information many times in one day.

### Who is collecting information and for what purpose?

GMI collects valuable information which assists in developing new products and services. When you are on a GMI site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with GMI alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than GMI, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.

Promotions that run on GMI may be sponsored by companies other than GMI or may be cosponsored by GMI and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared.

Any Sensitive Information (i.e. personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of the individual) will be treated with additional care. If GMI intends to disclose such information to a third party or use it for a different purpose than originally collected, then you will be expressly asked permission prior to any such disclosure.

Please be aware that GMI advertisers or websites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those websites linked to GMI are not covered by this privacy statement.

Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

### What else should I know about my privacy?

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
