We believe it’s important for you to know how we treat information about you that we receive from this website ('site') and how we carry out data processing practices, through the use of the internet and any other electronic communications networks. Please read the following privacy policy to understand how we use and protect the information you give us or how we may use and protect it in the future.

By registering for any services on this site or by providing any information to us, you consent to the collection, use and transfer of your information under the terms of this policy.

##  Information we collect from you

In general, you can visit this site without telling us who you are or giving us any information about yourself. Our web server collects the IP address. Our website uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files allow DoubleClick to recognise a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn, let us know which adverts to show you. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick.

With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
