# Privacy Statement

**GartnerGroup Privacy Practices on the Internet**

**Our Commitment to Privacy**

GartnerGroup is dedicated to the right of your privacy and data security on the Web. We are committed to handling the information you provide responsibly. We will take every prudent and practical step to safeguard your personal information and its use.

GartnerGroup promises to utilize all commercially reasonable steps to prevent the disclosure of your aggregated and personally identifiable information to third parties, except as you permit, or as may be required by law. GartnerGroup will never sell user information for marketing purposes to outside third parties.*

**How We Collect Information**

We collect user information through the use of "cookies" (see more details on cookies below) and through data submitted by you. We use this data to help track user trends and behaviors in order to better serve you and provide a meaningful and beneficial user experience as well as design new products and services that are of value to you. 

**The Types of Information We Collect**

  1. When you register on GartnerGroup Interactive ([www.gartner.com](http://www.gartner.com/)) we ask you to create a username and password which you can then use during future log-ins on the site. This information is stored in our database as unique identifiers, and allows us to deliver the research products and services to which you have subscribed.
  2. If you wish to purchase products and services available online, we ask that you provide us with credit card information for billing purposes. More information. 
  3. If you are interested in signing up for one of our available subscriber E-mails, we ask that you supply us with a valid E-mail address in order to guarantee delivery of your mail. Note: You may opt-out of receiving future mailings at ANY time by un-subscribing from the selected E-mail list. More information. 
  4. If you are filling out an online form on the GartnerGroup site, we may ask for additional demographic and contact information. This marketing information may be used to learn more about the types of users accessing the site and to help us provide you with services and products you will find valuable. 

**How We Use Collected Information**

  * To ensure our clients have access to their products and services 
  * To help us understand who is using our Web site and why 
  * To fulfill orders for products and services 
  * To register users for upcoming events online 
  * To improve overall user experience on our site through better functionality and design

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small piece of computer code that enables Web servers to "identify" visitors. When a user visits a Web site that uses cookie technology, the Web site adds a cookie to the user's browser that includes identification information, which is then stored on the user's desktop. Each time the user initiates a session on our Web site, the site sets the cookie in order to identify the user and his/her access privileges on the site. Cookies can contain only as much information as you provide to the site. 

You have the ability to delete cookie files from your hard drive at any time. However, you should know that cookies may be necessary to provide you access to content or features available on GartnerGroup Interactive. GartnerGroup uses cookie technology to enable users who register to move quickly and securely through access-controlled areas of the site. It also allows us to provide users with secure and authenticated access to GartnerGroup research that they own, allowing them to move freely between research articles without verifying their usernames each time. Cookie technology also enables all registered users to take advantage of features on the site such as "Search", "Browse" and "Profiling" as well as customized features including "Personal Home Page", "E-mail Notification" and "Usage Reporting". [More information](https://web.archive.org/public/static/help/faq.html#cookie).

**Data Security**

GartnerGroup provides its registered users with a secure online experience by utilizing a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. All user registration information is contained behind a "firewall" and only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to production systems. Passwords and credit card numbers are encrypted in GartnerGroup's secure database, which is also located behind a firewall. All sensitive/credit information supplied by users is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted in GartnerGroup's database as stated above.

**Accessing or Changing Your Personal Information**

If you wish to modify your personal/registration information, you may do so at any time by visiting the [Client Services](https://web.archive.org/public/static/clientservices/clientservices.html) page on GartnerGroup Interactive. 

**Unsubscribing From an E-mail List**

Even after submitting your E-mail address to receive one of our subscriber E-mails or Profiling notification E-mails, you have the option to opt-out at ANY TIME. To unsubscribe from a subscriber E-mail list, send your request to [unsubscribe@gartner.com](mailto:unsubscribe@gartner.com). To remove E-mail notification on your Profiles, go to http://www.gartnerweb.com/ggbin/personalpage, choose "Manage My Profiles" and then select "Edit one of my profiles".

**Business Relationships**

The GartnerGroup Web site contains links to other Web sites. Unfortunately, GartnerGroup can not be responsible for the privacy practices or content of such Web sites, and therefore we advise you to use caution when submitting personal information online.
