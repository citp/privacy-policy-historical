**Online Privacy Policy**

* * *

**Information Collection and Use**   
When you register on Gartner Web sites, or for Gartner events, or purchase products, we ask you for personal information. We use this information to provide you with the best advice and highest-quality service as well as with offers that we think are relevant to you. We may also contact you regarding a Web site problem or other customer service-related issues. 

Gartner does not market to children and does not knowingly collect personal information from children on Gartner Web sites. 

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
Gartner does not sell, share or rent personal information about you collected on Company Web sites outside the Gartner family of companies. 

**How to Unsubscribe**  
If you no longer want to receive e-mail communications from Gartner, you may unsubscribe by clicking the "Unsubscribe" button at the top or bottom of each e-mail Gartner sends, or by otherwise following the instructions to "opt out" appearing on that e-mail." 

**Registration**  
In order to use many features of Gartner Web sites, you may be asked to complete a registration form. During registration, you are required to provide contact information which is used to determine whether you are a subscriber or the authorized employee of a subscriber. 

**Alerts**  
When you sign up for e-mail Alerts from Gartner Web sites, you are asked to provide your e-mail address and to select topics to be included in the Alerts. Other information may also be necessary depending on the type of Alert requested. 

If you want to stop receiving Alerts from Gartner Web sites, click the "Alerts" link available from the top of the gartner.com homepage, then follow the instructions for deleting Alerts on the Alerts management page. 

**Purchases and Fulfillment**  
When you place an order or register for a Gartner event, we may request additional information such as credit card number and expiration date. This information is used for confirmation and billing purposes. The contact information you provide is used to service the order. Also, when you register for an event, we may request additional information about your hotel, meal and other travel preferences. This information is used only for the specific event. 

Gartner uses third-party service providers such as credit card processing companies, shipping companies, mailing houses and event coordinators together with other service providers as required to satisfy client requests. 

When you register for a Gartner event, we provide necessary information to hotels and to facilities hosting events. These parties are allowed to use that personal information only to provide services relevant to the event. 

**Usage Tracking**  
We monitor how you use our Web sites including search terms you enter, pages visited and documents viewed. If you are a registered user, this information is stored with your registration information. It is unique-number identifiable, and is used solely for purposes of enabling us to provide you with a personalized Web site experience. Aggregated (not personally identifiable) forms of this data may also be used in order to help us understand areas for future research and to identify future features and functions to develop for the Web sites. 

This data may also be used by Gartner, in the aggregate, to identify appropriate product offerings and subscription plans. 

This same data is also used by Gartner clients to help them understand how their subscriptions are being used by their employees and in this case, is personally identifiable to the specific client. 

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small piece of computer code that enables Web servers to "identify" visitors. Each time you initiate a session on Gartner Web sites, a cookie is set in order to identify you and determine your access privileges. Cookies do not store any of the information that you have provided to the site. They are simply identifiers. 

You have the ability to delete cookie files from your hard drive at any time. However, you should know that cookies may be necessary to provide you with access to much of the content and many of the features of Gartner Web sites. We use cookie technology to enable registered users to move quickly and securely through access-controlled areas of the sites. Cookie technology also enables registered users to take advantage of certain useful features on the sites, including "remember my password." 

**Links to Other Sites**  
Gartner Web sites contain links to other Web sites. Please be aware that Gartner is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our sites and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Gartner Web sites. 

**Security**  
Gartner provides its users with a secure online experience. To do this, we use a variety of security measures to maintain the safety and confidentiality of personal information about you. All user registration information is contained behind a firewall and only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to our production systems. Confidential personal information sent to us is transmitted using Secure Socket Layer technology. This information is then encrypted in our secure database. The database is further protected behind a firewall. If you have any questions about the security at our Web sites, please send an e-mail to [security.officer@gartner.com](mailto:security.officer@gartner.com). 

**Updating Personal Information**  
If your personal information changes, you may update it at any time. To correct or update personal information, go to your user profile on our Web sites. 

**Notification of Policy Changes**  
We will notify you about significant changes to our Privacy Policy by placing a prominent notice on our Web site and in some instances, we may send a notice to the primary e-mail address specified in your user profile. 

**Contact Gartner**  
If you would like to be taken off our marketing lists, please send an e-mail to [privacy@gartner.com](mailto:privacy@gartner.com). For additional questions, please contact the Gartner Privacy Officer nearest you.
