## 3\. Sharing Your Information

We do not rent or sell your personal contact information (such as your email address associated with your account registration) to third parties to use for their own marketing purposes. We share information in the following ways:

**Platform Visitors and Users**

Though our Platform, others may find, contact, view, and follow your profile and public activity on our Platform (for example, if you "like" content on our Platform), including through your username. You can customize your profile and whether users may follow you through your [settings](https://www.houzz.com/settingsAdvanced). Unless you make them private using your settings and other tools, your Ideabooks, photos, notes on others' photos, projects, discussions, social media profiles, followers, and others you follow are viewable and open to comments by others. [Learn](https://help.houzz.com/s/article/How-do-I-adjust-my-privacy-settings?language=en_US) how to make these private. If you are a professional or seller, we may also display aggregated information about your activity in order to help visitors and users evaluate you, including your response rate and last visit to our Platform. We cannot control Platform visitors' and users' use of any information or content you choose to make available publicly.

**Professionals, Sellers, and Other Businesses**

If you request us to find professionals for you, your project information (including the contact information) that you provide will be made available to a limited number of professionals that we believe may be suitable for your project. Professionals and sellers that participate on the Houzz Platform may view your public activities on our Platform and receive feedback you provide to us about your engagement with them. For example, if you requested us to find professionals for you and provide us feedback about your level of interest in these professionals, we may convey such feedback to them. In addition, a professional or seller can view your public activities on our Platform that are interactions with their content (for example, that you added one of their photos to your non-private Ideabook on a particular date, as identified by the username for your profile and any photo or public identifiers you provide for your profile). The business cannot see your non-public account information (for example, email address) or see private activity (for example, if your Ideabook is private). We ask professionals, sellers, and advertising businesses on our Platform to limit the use of your information to the reasons for which the information was provided. However, their use of your information is subject to their own privacy policies.

**Service Providers and Platform Partners**

We may share your information with others as reasonably needed for our uses described in this Privacy Policy, and we ask them to limit their use of that information.You can find more information about our service providers and platform partners [here](https://help.houzz.com/s/article/Service-Providers-and-Platform-Partners?language=en_US). In addition, if you specifically agree to share your information with a third-party partner, for example, as part of a contest or promotion we sponsor with such third party, we will share your contact information with that third-party partner.

**Advertisers and Ad Networks**

We use advertising networks and similar companies to serve advertisements on third-party sites and to assist us in evaluating the effectiveness of our advertising. We may work with advertising partners to serve ads on our Platform. We may use advertising partners to communicate with you at the addresses they have for you. These types of companies use cookies and similar technologies. We may provide advertising networks, advertising partners, and businesses advertising on our platform with aggregate information but other than hashed information or device identifiers, we do not disclose your name, contact information, or other personal information. For more information, please see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.houzz.com/cookiePolicy).

In these cases, their use will be subject to this Privacy Policy.

**Investigations**

## 11\. International Transfers of Personal Information

The Houzz group is a global organization, headquartered in the United States, with service providers, corporate affiliates, and operations in several countries. In order to provide you with the services you sign up for by creating a Houzz account or visiting our Platform, your personal information will be transferred to and processed in the United States (or any other country where we, our corporate affiliates, agents, and service providers operate). Data protection laws differ among jurisdictions, and the United States and these other jurisdictions may not provide the same level of protection for personal information as your jurisdiction of residence. If you are from the European Economic Area ("EEA") and we transfer your personal information to countries outside of the EEA, we will take appropriate steps to ensure your personal information is afforded the same level of protection as described in this Privacy Policy. If you are located in the EEA or Switzerland, we comply with all legal requirements for the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the EEA or Switzerland. [Learn more about our participation in the Privacy Shield Frameworks](https://help.houzz.com/s/article/Privacy-Shield-Frameworks?language=en_US).

## 12\. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information (European Economic Area)

If you are from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. We collect and use your information for a variety of business purposes that are in our legitimate interests, in order to enter into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, or to comply with our legal obligations.

If you wish to learn more about specific legal grounds we rely on to process your information for any particular purpose (including any legitimate interests we have to process this information), please contact us as provided under the Contact Us section. For example, we rely on our legitimate interests to process information for direct marketing purposes and for fraud prevention and detection, provided these interests are not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

## 13\. Your Data Protection Rights (European Economic Area)

In some regions, such as the EEA, you may have certain rights in relation to your personal information, including the right to access, correct, update, or request deletion of your personal information. Houzz takes reasonable steps to ensure that the data we collect is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and up to date. You also can manage your profile and [settings](https://www.houzz.com/settingsAdvanced) within our Platform. However, if you are not a user of our Platform and you want to contact us directly about accessing, correcting, updating, or deleting your personal information, or altering your data or marketing preferences, you can do so at any time by contacting as provided in the Contact Us section. We will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.

You can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us as provided in the Contact Us section. You also can deactivate your profile and obtain a copy of your information through your [settings](https://www.houzz.com/settingsAdvanced).

You can complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information in relation to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Contact details for data protection authorities in the EEA and Switzerland are available [here](http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080).

Similarly, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. We may ask you to verify your identity in order to help us respond efficiently to your request.
