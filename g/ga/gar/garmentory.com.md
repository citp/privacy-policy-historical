Garmentory Inc. ("Garmentory", "us" or "we") recognize the importance of your privacy. Please read the following Privacy Policy to understand how we will treat your Personal Information in connection with our website located at www.garmentory.com and any successor, replacement or related website (collectively, "Website"), products, and services (which altogether are referred to here as the "Services"), and our customer, vendor and partner relationships. In this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. By providing information to us, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You should not use this Website if you disagree with how we intend to collect or use your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

1\. Personal Information We Collect

What Personal Information we collect depends upon how individuals choose to interact with us. We may collect Personal Information about you from various sources described below. Where applicable, we indicate whether and why you must provide us with your Personal Information, as well as the consequences of failing to do so. If you do not provide Personal Information when requested, you may not be able to benefit from our Services if that information is necessary to provide you with them or if we are legally required to collect that information.

a. Personal Information Provided by You

**Registration.** If you register to use the Services or receive our promotions, then you must provide us with your name, email address, and a password in order to create an account. You may also indicate your preferences with regard to receiving our updates and promotions.

**Purchases.** If you make a purchase on the Services, then we will ask you to provide your name, address, email address, phone number, and payment information, such as your credit card number, so our service providers can process your payments for the applicable service.

**Communications.** We will collect any information which you provide to us through your communications with us e.g., with our customer-support team, when you post to a bulletin board or other forum available on this Website (e.g., web chats, blogs and community forums). In this context, we will process your message, the date and time of your message, our response and any other Personal Information you provide. If you contact us to apply for a job with Garmentory, we will process your job application, including your resume and other Personal Information you submit to us in that context.

**Partners Websites.** We may offer some Services through relationships with other companies and websites, including Google, Affirm, Stripe, PayPal, Sift Science, NetElixer, Algolia, Retention Science, Delighted, Airbrake and Full Story. For example, we may offer information and services on third party websites, such as advertising, fraud detection, payment processing, website analytics and customer communication. Personal information that you provide to those websites may be sent to us, including general location, ip addresses, browsing behaviors, email addresses, phone numbers, names, and addresses. We may combine that information with Personal Information you provided to us to communicate information regarding purchases made, improve website customer experience, or communicate further opportunities for purchases.

For example, when you log in using your Facebook credentials, we collect the information that you have made available in Facebook and that Facebook shares for social sign-on, such as your name, location, email address and profile picture. We may combine such Personal Information with Personal Information you provided to us to register your user account and communicate purchase information.

c. Personal Information Collected via Automated Means 

**Cookies and Similar Technologies.** When you visit our Website or use the Services, we may send one or more cookies (that is, small text files) to your computer or mobile device. This enables us to automatically collect and store some information that you do not actively provide, such as your internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, the date and time of your visit, and the last website or webpage you visited. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can typically change your browser’s settings to refuse all cookies or notify you of a new cookie request. However, some features of the Services will not function properly if cookies are disabled, deleted or refused.

We may use other technology, such as clickstreams to, through and from our Services and web beacons (also sometimes called pixel tags or transparent GIFs) to, among other things, track use of our Services, and habits and preferences of our visitors. We also may use such technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.

During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.

We use this information to improve the Services by assessing how many users access or use our Services, which content, products, and features of our service most interest our visitors, what types of offers our customers like to see, and how our service performs from a technical point of view.

We work with Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Website and report on activities and trends. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/>, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.

In addition, we may have relationships with partner websites and advertising companies that allow those companies to use cookies and other internet technology such as web beacons to track your interactions with our Services and email communications. These companies may combine this information with information about your visits to other sites and services for their use, and we may receive information from these companies about your use of our Services and third party websites. This information may include email address, location, browsing behavior, ip address, and product interests. It may be possible that these companies could associate Personal Information that you provide to them when visiting their sites with the tracking data they receive in connection with your use of our Services. Their use of your Personal Information is governed by their privacy policies.

You should think carefully before disclosing any Personal Information in any public forum.
  * We may also share Personal Information with our selected suppliers, service providers and partner websites in order to facilitate providing the Services to you including selling products to you.

  * We may also share de-identified information with other companies for marketing purposes, such as to display effectiveness of targeted advertising with or in our Services or the websites or services of other companies. This information may include aggregated information such as usage statistics or demographic trends regarding our users or those of websites or services with which we have a business relationship. It may also include de-identified information regarding particular users of our Services, such as information about websites or pages visited by the particular user.
  * We may share Personal Information where you have consented to share that information for specific purposes. For example, you may choose to allow us to share Personal Information with our partners when you enter a contest.

If you delete your account, we may retain certain information associated with your account for recordkeeping. Further, we generally do not remove information that you have made publicly available, and information that has already been provided to third parties as described in this privacy policy may be retained by those third parties and will be subject to their policies.

Each marketing email communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. You may also contact us as indicated below to have your name deleted from our email mailing lists, or you may update your communication preferences in your account settings on our Website.
