# Privacy Statement | Garmin | United States

Last updated: February 14, 2017

Your privacy is important to Garmin. We developed this Privacy Statement so you know how we collect, use, share and store your personal information.

This Privacy Statement applies to all websites, applications (“apps”) and products on which this Privacy Statement is shown. If a Garmin website, app or product links to a different privacy statement, then that privacy statement will apply to your use of that site, app or product. For example, we have a [separate privacy statement](https://connect.garmin.com/en-US/privacy) that applies to Garmin Connect and its compatible Garmin wearable and other devices.

## Ways Garmin Collects and Uses Personal Information

"Personal Information" is information that, either alone or in combination with other information collected, identifies an individual. When we combine other information (i.e., information that does not, on its own, identify an individual) with Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information.

### When you Create a Garmin Account

When you create an account on a Garmin website or mobile app, we ask you to provide Personal Information, including your name and email address. You do not need to provide your full name, but you may if you wish. You will use your email address and your password to login to your account. Your Garmin account will be password-protected. We use your name to help verify your account when you call customer support.

### When You Login to Your Garmin Account with Social Media Credentials

You may choose to login to your Garmin account using your social media login credentials (e.g., your Facebook login credentials). If you choose to do this, when you login to your Garmin account using social media login credentials for the first time, you will be asked whether you agree that the social media provider may provide certain information to Garmin, such as your name, email address, profile photo, posts, comments and other information associated with your social media account.

All of this information is made available to Garmin by the social media provider due to the way the social sign-on configuration works, but of this information, Garmin only retains and uses your email address. Garmin uses the email address provided by the social media provider to associate it with your Garmin account so that you can use your email address to login to your Garmin account in the future if you no longer wish to login using your social media login credentials.

If you do not want your information to be shared with Garmin by the social media provider, then you can simply login to your Garmin account using your Garmin account login credentials without using your social media login credentials.

### When You Buy Products on a Garmin Website

If you purchase a product on a Garmin site, then Garmin will collect Personal Information from you, such as your name, mailing address and telephone number, so that we can process your order and fulfill your purchase. We do not view or store your payment card information. A third party, Adyen, processes customer payment card information when Garmin customers use a payment card to make a purchase on a Garmin site. We recommend you carefully review [Adyen’s Privacy Policy](https://www.adyen.com/).

### When you Communicate with Garmin

When you interact with our customer support representatives via email, telephone or in person, we may collect Personal Information, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address and contact preferences; and information about the Garmin products you own, such as their serial numbers and date of purchase. We also may create event logs that are useful in diagnosing product or app performance related issues, and capture information relating to the support or service issue. We use this information to provide you with customer and product support. We may access your Garmin account in order to assist us in providing you the necessary assistance. To improve customer service, subject to applicable laws, we may also record and review conversations with customer support representatives, and analyze any feedback provided to us through voluntary customer surveys.

We may use Personal Information to communicate with you, including communicating with you about your account or transactions with us, giving you important information about your products or apps, sending you notice about material changes to this Privacy Statement, and, consistent with applicable laws and the choices available to you as described below under Your Choices regarding Marketing Correspondence, sending you offers and promotions for our products and apps.

### When You Use Location Features on Your Garmin Device or App

If you elect to use location-based services, such as weather, traffic information, fuel prices, movie times, and local event information, on your Garmin app or device, then the physical location of your device will be collected in order for Garmin or our providers to provide you with such location-based services.

### When you Use Your Garmin Auto Navigation Device or App

If you use a Garmin auto navigation device or app and provide your consent when asked, then Garmin will collect and upload from your device data such as location, speed, direction, and time and date of recording. This data will be de-identified by Garmin and used to enhance the quality of our products and apps and the traffic, parking and other features enabled by Garmin or content providers. If you provide your consent when asked, then Garmin may also share this de-identified data with or sell this data to third parties to enhance the quality of the traffic, parking and other features enabled by content providers.

### Other Uses of Personal Information by Garmin

Garmin may use Personal Information for internal statistical, marketing or operational purposes, including generating sales reports and measuring and understanding demographic, user interest, purchasing and other trends among our customers.

## Entities with Which Garmin May Share Personal Information

### With Other Garmin Companies

Garmin is a global business. To offer our products, apps and services, we may need to transfer your Personal Information to other Garmin companies in other countries, including Garmin International, Inc. in the United States, where many of our servers are located. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. [View Garmin-owned companies](http://www.garmin.com/en-US/legal/garmin-companies).

Any such transfers of Personal Information from Garmin companies in the European Economic Area ("EEA") or Switzerland to Garmin International, Inc. in the United States are done pursuant to European Commission approved Model Contractual Clauses.

All Garmin companies are required to follow the privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Statement.

### With Data and Content Providers

If you use a Garmin auto navigation device or app and provide your consent when asked, then Garmin will collect and upload from your device data such as location, speed, direction, and time and date of recording. If you provide your consent, then Garmin may also share this de-identified data with or sell this data to third parties to enhance the quality of the traffic, parking and other features enabled by content providers.

### With Social Network Providers

From time to time, we provide email addresses of selected Garmin customers who have opted in to receiving marketing correspondence about Garmin products and apps to social network providers so they can help us display advertisements on the social network pages of other users who share common qualities (e.g., demographics and interests) with the selected Garmin customers.

If you sign up to be notified by email when a particular Garmin product or app will be available for purchase, in addition to using your email address to notify you when that product or app becomes available for purchase, we may also provide your email address to social network providers so they can help us to display advertisements about that product or app on your social network pages.

### With Service Providers

We use third party service providers to help us to administer certain activities on our behalf, such as fulfilling purchases and shipping products, processing credit card payments, sending emails, providing advertisements, analyzing usage of our websites and apps, tracking effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, and allowing users to connect to their social network. We may share Personal Information about you with such third party service providers to the extent necessary for the sole purpose of enabling them to perform services on our behalf.

Here are examples of third-party service providers we use:

  * **Email Providers:** Cloud services from Adobe are used to assist Garmin in sending emails, consistent with applicable laws and the choices available to you as described below under Your Choices regarding Marketing Correspondence.
  * **Analytics Services:** Garmin uses third-party service providers to help us better understand usage of Garmin Express and other Garmin products and mobile apps, and for related purposes. The third parties we currently use to provide such analytics and related services are described below under Cookies and Similar Technology.



### Ad Event Logs

If you choose to use Garmin apps that contain advertisements, we may collect information such as which advertisements were viewed, how often they were clicked and how often certain actions such as saving a coupon or calling or routing to a location corresponding to an advertisement were performed so that the advertising providers can provide you with content and advertising that might be of particular interest to you.

### Other Disclosures

We may disclose Personal Information about you to others if we have your consent to do so in such form of consent as may be required under applicable law.

Subject to applicable laws in your jurisdiction, we may also disclose Personal Information about you to others as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law or regulation, including laws or regulations outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public authorities and law enforcement officials, including officials outside your country of residence; (d) to assist or support theft investigations involving Garmin products or property, (e) to enforce any of our terms and conditions or policies; (f) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates and subsidiaries; (g) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Garmin, its affiliates and subsidiaries, you or others; or (h) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.

We may also transfer Personal Information to an affiliate, a subsidiary or a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of Garmin's business, assets or stock, including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding.

## Ways You May Share Personal Information or Direct Garmin to Share Your Personal Information

### LiveTrack

LiveTrack is a feature available on some Garmin devices that enables you to send a link to people of your choice that allows them to see the real-time location of your device. Anyone with access to the link will be able to see the real-time location of your Garmin device, so you should use caution in determining to whom you want to send the link and be sure that you trust them to not send the link to others whom you do not want to be able to view the location of your Garmin device.

If you choose to post an invitation to view the location of your Garmin device on third-party social networks, then, depending on the privacy practices of those social networks, it is possible that persons in addition to those whom you intended to invite to view your location information could have access to such information. Accordingly, you should use caution when making such an invitation via third-party social networks, and you should carefully review the privacy practices of such social networks.

### Message Boards, Forums

Some Garmin websites and apps have message boards, forums, chat functionality, blogs, and similar features through which you can post information, messages and materials. Please note that any information you disclose through such services or otherwise on our sites may become public information, and may be available to visitors to the sites and to the general public. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose Personal Information, or any other information, on our websites or apps.

### Promotions

If you enter into a sweepstakes, contest or similar promotion, we may use the information you provide to administer those promotions. To the extent that the terms and conditions of any such promotion regarding the treatment of Personal Information about you conflict with this Privacy Statement, the terms and conditions of the promotion will control.

When you sync your Garmin device through Garmin Express, data recorded on your device about your activity is transferred from your device to our servers. Each time a sync occurs, we log data about the transmission, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address used when syncing, the sync time and date, crash/diagnostic logs, geographic location of the device, information about your device, information about the network used to sync (e.g., Wi-Fi or cellular) and device battery level. We use this information to help identify and resolve syncing issues.

We track and collect data from users about their usage of Garmin Express and Garmin mobile apps. The types of analytical information that are collected include the date and time the device accesses our servers, software version, the geographic location of the device, language, what information and files have been downloaded to the device, user behavior (e.g. what features used, frequency of use), device state information, device model, hardware and operating system information, and information relating to how the device functions. Garmin uses this data to improve the quality and functionality of Garmin Express and other Garmin products and apps; to develop and market products and features that best serve you and other users; and to help identify and fix usability problems as quickly as possible.
