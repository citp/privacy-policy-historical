<p>

</p>
<p>
In order to use certain functionalities of the Services, you will have to create a user account which requires you to submit certain personal data.

</p>
<p>
4.	VIEWING WEB PAGES
</p>
<p>
As with most websites, your computer sends information which may include personal data about you that gets logged by a web server when you browse our Site. This typically includes without limitation your computer's IP address, operating system, browser name/version, the referring web page, requested page, date/time, and sometimes a "cookie" (which can be disabled using your browser preferences) to help the site remember your last visit. If you are logged in, this information is associated with your personal account. The information is also included in anonymous statistics to allow us to understand how visitors use our site.
</p>
<p> 
5.	COOKIES
</p>
<p> 
5.1	We may from time to time implement "cookies" or other features to allow us or third parties to collect or share information that will help us improve our Site and the Services we offer, or help us offer new services and features. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your computer or device and tell us how and when the Services or website are used or visited, by how many people and to track movements within our website. We may link cookie information to personal data. Cookies also link to information regarding what items you have selected for purchase pages you have viewed, or games you have played.

</p>
<p>

<p>
As with browsing web pages, when you watch content and advertising or download games and access other software on our Site or through the Services, most of the same information is sent to us (including, without limitation, IP Address, operating system, etc.); but, instead of page views, your computer sends us information on the content, advertisement or game viewed and/or software installed by the Services and the website and time.

We only use information received from customer support requests, including, without limitation, email addresses, for customer support services and we do not transfer to or share this information with any third parties.
</p>
<p>
7.2	You can also post questions and answer other user questions in our community forums. Our forum and messaging services allow you to participate in our community; to do so, we maintain information, such as your User ID, contact list and status messages, including what game you are currently playing (if you explicitly choose to enable this option).. In addition, these and similar services in the future may require us to maintain your User ID and password.
</p>
<p>
8.	SURVEYS
</p>
<p>
From time-to-time, we may request information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose your information to us. Information requested may include, without limitation, contact information (such as your email address), and demographic information (such as interests or age level).
