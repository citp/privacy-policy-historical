When you visit the Garnier website, like when you visit most other websites, certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically logged, which may include information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the internet (such as "aol.com" or "earthlink.net"), the date and time you access the site, the pages you access while at the Garnier website, and the internet address of the website, if any, from which you linked directly to the Garnier site. This information is not personally identifiable. 

Personally Identifiable Information

Personally Identifiable Information is any information that concerns you individually and would permit someone to contact you, for example, your name, address, telephone/fax number, social security number, email address or any information you submitted to Garnier.com that identifies you individually. 

Garnier.com will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it. Therefore, if you do not want Garnier.com to obtain any personally identifiable information about you, do not submit it. 

You can visit and browse the Garnier website without revealing personally identifiable information about yourself.
