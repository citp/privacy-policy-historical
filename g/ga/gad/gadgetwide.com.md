> YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS

**When users leave comments on articles or  posts, unique network identifiers are collected and posted alongside each publicly posted comment. The information includes but is not limited to, IP address, MAC address, Operating System (OS), web browser, version indicators and more. This data is collected and re-posted in order to minimize SPAM and threatening articles of data. The collected information from user comments also serve as unique identifiers assisting us in targeting users, sorting through comments and more. The justification of these practices would likely be used in an example scenario such as, obtaining the name of a comments author (in order to identify a cingular user enrolled in a comment-based give-away or other similar situation). This type of data usage is the most commonly used form such as that stated within the last example.      **
