# Welcome to Gadzoo.com

_Last updated: April 2007_

This Privacy Policy applies to personally identifiable information collected by or on behalf of Gadzoo.com on Web sites where this Privacy Policy is posted. If, however, you are accessing this document from a Web site operated in conjunction with one of our affiliate newspapers (listed at www.gadzoo.com/PetsAffiliate/pets.aspx) ("Affiliate Newspaper"), the privacy policy of the Affiliate Newspaper will govern unless such terms state otherwise. 

**Collection of information**

In general, you can visit the Gadzoo.com Web site or a site powered by Gadzoo.com (hereafter collectively referred to as "this site"), without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Gadzoo.com does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals (such as name, postal address, e-mail address, and phone number) except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals on interactive areas of the site. For example, personally identifiable information is collected from the placement of classified advertising, Pet Memorial Tribute submissions, purchases on the Gadzoo.com store, and the purchase of other products and services offered or administered by Gadzoo.com. 

Like most Web sites, Gadzoo.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools such as cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing this site. Cookies may involve the transmission of information either directly to Gadzoo.com or to another party we authorize to collect information on our behalf. In addition, our server logs automatically receive and record information from your browser (including, for example, your IP address, and the page(s) you visit). 

Gadzoo.com and/or the associated Affiliate Newspaper are the sole owner(s) of the information collected on this site. 

**Use of information**

We will use your information only as permitted by law. Personal information you specifically provide is used to process transactions and provide the products and services we offer. Personal information may also be used for purposes of site administration and troubleshooting. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of the site (our web hosting service, for example), may need to access such information from time to time, but are not permitted to disclose such information to others. 

Gadzoo.com uses information collected through the technical methods mentioned above, such as cookies, to track and measure user traffic to this site and to provide account access. In addition, we may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our Web server and to administer this site. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

Gadzoo.com does not share personally identifiable information about our visitors with third parties (unless access to such information is necessary to troubleshoot or maintain the operation of the site), and does not sell or share any information at the individual visitor level. We may share information aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. with our partners, advertisers and others. 

Gadzoo.com may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process (such as pursuant to court order, subpoena, or a request by law enforcement officials); (2) protect, enforce, and defend our Terms of Use, rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of this site; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions). 

This site makes classified advertisements, Pet Memorial Tributes, and other postings by customers available for viewing by all our visitors. Please remember that any information disclosed therein becomes public information. You therefore should exercise caution when disclosing any personal information in these forums. 

**Security measures**

The security and confidentiality of your personal information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect guest information from unauthorized access and improper use. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. 

**Correcting or updating information**

You may modify and correct information previously provided directly to Gadzoo.com for the purposes of classified advertisements, Pet Memorial Tributes, and purchases on the Gadzoo.com store, if necessary. Additionally, although classified advertisement enhancements and Pet Memorial Tribute submissions are screened for content appropriateness, they are not altered except by request.
