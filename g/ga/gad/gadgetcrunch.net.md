**Electronically Produced Data**  
Cookies. www.gadgetcrunch.net, like most standard website servers, may use cookies and other tools to collect information about how you use the Site. A cookie is a small, unique text file that a website can send to your computer hard drive when you visit a site. www.gadgetcrunch.net may use “session cookies”, which terminate when a user closes his or her browser, and/or “persistent cookies”, which remain on the user’s computer until manually deleted. Most web browsers can either alert you to the use of cookies or refuse to accept cookies entirely. If you do not want www.gadgetcrunch.net to deploy cookies in your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website tries to put a cookie on your computer. Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use the Site.  
Action Tags. Like most standard website servers, www.gadgetcrunch.net may employ a software technology called action tags (also known as “web beacons”, “single pixel gifs”, “clear gifs” or “web bugs”), which collect information and help to manage cookies, in order to gather information about Site usage. Action tags help www.gadgetcrunch.net identify and track the performance of web pages on the Site, therefore allowing www.gadgetcrunch.net to measure the performance and quality of the Site and to manage Site content. In addition, www.gadgetcrunch.net may use action tags in emails. This allows www.gadgetcrunch.net to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications by showing, for example, how many emails have been opened.
