# GadBall : Privacy Statement

  
**Effective April 1, 2006:**

**About GadBall.com GadBall.com**   
("GadBall") is an online professional, personal and career community networking service. Users of the GadBall website and service ("Users") can post resumes on the GadBall website and utilize the GadBall Resume Distribution technologies to distribute their resumes to multiple internet employment sites from GadBall. Users can also create personal profiles and link these to other Users through User established networks. 

GadBall Users can view the profiles of other Users, communicate with friends (both new and old) on the service, share photos, post messages and comments, and describe their professional, personal, and career interests. To enrich and facilitate the experiences of our Users we request and display some personal information to other Users and visitors of GadBall, which allows Users to identify each other and expand their networks. GadBall Users can edit their User profile information at any time and control which internet employment sites receive their information, and how other GadBall Users and GadBall communicates with them. 

Upholding the privacy of our Users is paramount to GadBall. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at [ GadBallUserPrivacy@GadBall.com](mailto:GadBallUserPrivacy@GadBall.com). 

**Information Collection and Use by GadBall.com**   
GadBall collects User submitted information such as name, eMail address, and age to authenticate Users and to send notifications to Users relating to the GadBall service. GadBall also collects other profile data including but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, work history, education and occupation in order to assist Users in finding and communicating with each other. 

GadBall automates the process of posting a resume on multiple internet employment sites, and GadBall only transmits User resume information to internet employment sites as requested by the User. 

GadBall logs non-personally identifiable information including IP address, aggregate profile information, aggregate User data, aggregate resume content, and browser type, from Users and visitors to the site. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes. All of this data is used to manage the website, track usage, display relevant advertising, and improve the website services. This non-personally identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to facilitate the provision of more relevant services and advertisements to members. 

GadBall will never provide, share, rent or sell User-specific personal information to any third parties, unless the User requests GadBall to transmit this information on the User’s behalf. 

User Profile information including members' pictures, first names, and city, state (or province) and country of residence are displayed to other Users and visitors in order to facilitate User interaction in the GadBall social networking community. 

EMail addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join GadBall, to add Users to a User’s friends' network(s), and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends, and notifications, a User's eMail address is not shared or displayed to people within a User's personal network. Users within a personal network communicate on GadBall with each other through the GadBall service, without disclosing their email addresses. Users' full names are never directly revealed to other members. To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the service, GadBall allows Users to search for other members using first and last name, email address, and schools and/or companies where Users may have attended or worked. 

GadBall may also use a User's email address to send updates, notifications of unread eMail messages, or a newsletter or news regarding the service. Users may choose not to receive email of this type by changing their "notification" settings on the User "Account Settings". 

GadBall or a partner may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on GadBall. Participating Users may be asked to provide personal information including (but not limited to) name, eMail address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. GadBall will make it clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information; the User electing transfer of information from GadBall is responsible for reviewing the Privacy Policy of the recipient – this includes the resume distribution service of GadBall in which the User specifically selects the sites to receive the User’s resume. 

**Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members  
**GadBall Users can invite friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. GadBall stores the email addresses that Users provide so that the respondents may be added to the User’s network, and to send the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations. GadBall does not sell, rent, or trade these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders (up to three [3] per email address). Recipients of invitations from GadBall may contact GadBall to request the removal of their information from our database. 

GadBall Users may also store email addresses of people they know in their internal GadBall address book and may also choose to send invitations and other communications to those addresses.
