If you have questions about the appropriate safeguards Gaastra has in place or wish to obtain a copy of such safeguards, please see below under "How Gaastra may share the information Gaastra collects" and/or contact us via [service@gaastra-group.com].

## How Gaastra may share the information Gaastra collects

Gaastra and its affiliated entities share information with each other or with third-party service providers for general business purposes and analytical purposes pursued by Gaastra, such as internal administration, billing, claim handling and services, and providing you or your organization with services.

Gaastra and its affiliated entities may share information with third-party data controllers (including law enforcement agencies and potential transaction partners) where Gaastra and its affiliated entities have a legal basis to do so. 

Gaastra does not sell, rent, or otherwise share personal data with information that reasonably identifies you for their independent use except as expressly described in this Privacy Statement or when Gaastra has a legal basis to do so, for instance with your prior consent.

If Gaastra transfers your personal data to a recipient outside the European Union, it will only do so in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation. In these circumstances we will take appropriate steps to ensure that your personal data is adequately protected. Typically, such steps include carrying out data security reviews of any recipients and putting in place contracts with such recipients to ensure they employ the same or similar appropriate technical and organisational measures as Gaastra, so your data is adequately protected.

Gaastra retains the information collected in an identifiable form as long as reasonably necessary and only for as long as required to fulfill the purposes and on the lawful grounds described above for which Gaastra collects the information and to comply with our legal obligations.
