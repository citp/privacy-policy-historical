Effective date June 11, 2010 (last updated May 2019)  


##   
This Privacy Policy applies to our platforms.

This Privacy Policy describes how GAF Materials LLC d/b/a GAF (“we,” “us,” “our” or “ourselves”) treats the information we gather in connection with the digital platforms we operate and that link to this Privacy Policy. Our digital platforms include, but are not limited to, our Company website(s), product review tools or services, the GAF My Roof and Contractor Zone portals, GAF chat service(s), and mobile applications (“apps”). This Privacy Policy also applies to the information that we may collect via social media platforms and our electronic communications. 

By accessing or using our digital platforms, or registering for any of our product warranties or guarantees, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This includes changes that we may post here from time to time.

##  We collect information from and about you.

**Information you submit or post.**  We collect the information you provide to us, enter on our digital platforms, or post in public forums. This includes the information you post on our social media pages or on third party websites, information you provide when making purchases from us, and information provided to register for an account, warranty, guaranty, or portal. The information collected may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, phone number(s), email address(es), username, password, demographics (e.g., gender or age), graphics, and payment information.  

By providing information to us, you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content that you provide; that the content is accurate; that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify us for all claims resulting from content you supply. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any content provided by you or any third party.   


**Other Information.**  We, our service providers, and businesses that support our business operations, including, but not limited to, third party providers of advertising or analytics services, may use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to automatically collect information when you access our digital platforms or interact with our electronic communications. The information that we collect automatically or manually, may include technical information from or about your computer, mobile device or Wi-Fi network (including SSID and password for certain apps), DHCP, the browser you use, your search history, the number of times you visit our platforms, the device you use, identifiers associated with your device, your device’s operating system, the content you view on our digital platforms, the content you view immediately before and after using our digital platforms, product preferences, and the programs and services you use with us or others. We, our service providers, and third parties (e.g., network advertising companies) may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our digital platforms.

We may obtain information about you from third parties. For example, our business partners may provide us with information about you.

##  Location Information.

Our apps may collect precise information about the location of your mobile device when location services are enabled on your device. We may use the information to provide you with information, promotions, or advertising relevant to your location. We do not share location information with third parties for their independent use without your consent.

## We use information as disclosed and described here.

We use information to provide you with services, including on our digital platforms or in connection with our products and apps, and to respond to your requests, inquiries, comments, and questions. We also use information to send you products you may want to purchase.

We use information to troubleshoot and improve our products and services, including our digital platforms. We may use the information we collect to customize your experience with us.

We use information for marketing purposes. For example, we might use the information we collect to send you information about products, services or special offers that we believe may interest you. This might include information about upcoming contests or promotions. We may use the information we collect to deliver advertisements based on your activities on our digital platforms and third party websites and apps. For example, if you view one of our products on our website, you may receive an online ad for that product or a related product on our digital platforms or on third party websites and apps.

We use information to communicate with you about your account or our relationship. For example, we might tell you about changes to our platforms or to your accounts. Or we might reach out to you and ask you to take a customer satisfaction survey.

We may use the information we collect to better understand the interests and preferences of our customers, people who use our digital platforms, and people who buy our products. For example, we may use information to generate and analyze aggregate statistics about how users interact with our digital platforms.

We may combine the information we collect. For example, we might combine information you give us with information we get from a public source. We might also combine information we collect from you with information we get from third parties. When we do so, we treat the combined information as disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

We use information as permitted by law and as otherwise disclosed to you. For example, we may use the information we collect to protect the rights and property of us, you, and others.

##    
We may share information with third parties. 

We will share information within our Company. We may share your information with our affiliates or subsidiaries. We may also share information with other related entities.

These vendors include companies that handle credit card processing and shipping, companies that provide us with data management services, companies that manage our digital platforms, and companies that manage our communications and perform market research for us.

We may share information with third party marketing partners. For example, we might share information with a company with whom we are running a joint promotion.

We may share information with online network advertisers and similar companies to facilitate the delivery of marketing communications on our digital platforms and thirdparty websites and apps. Those communications may include ads regarding our or others’ products based on your interests. We may use third party analytics providers that collect information about your use of our digital platforms to help us understand how people interact with those digital platforms.

We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves. For example, we will share your information with legal authorities when we think it reasonable to do so.
