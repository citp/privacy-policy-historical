Gate 1 Travel values your trust and is committed to protecting your privacy. We use SSL encryption to protect your sensitive information online. This privacy policy is designed to inform you of what information we collect, why we collect such information, and how we use the information we collect. By using this Website, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy.

### Collected Information:

Generally, information will be collected when you book a reservation, enter a sweepstakes, participate in a survey, ask us a question, subscribe to our newsletter, or initiate a purchase on our website.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**  
We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information when you visit our website. This is any information that cannot be used to identify a particular person. Examples of this include IP address, pages viewed, computer operating system, browser type, browsing & usage habits, domain name, date of visit, and referring URL. We use this information for the purpose of diagnosing problems with our server and administering the operation of our website.

**Personally Identifiable Information**  
You can browse our website without revealing any personal identifiable information about yourself. This is any information that we can use to identify a particular person.

We only collect this information when you make a reservation or choose to provide it to us. When you submit your personal information to us, you are giving us your consent to the collection, use and disclosure as stated in this privacy policy. If you are making a reservation for a travel companion or another person, it is important that you obtain his or her consent before providing us with their personal information.

We may also obtain both non-personal and personal information about you from business partners, entities affiliated to us, travel shows, travel-related agencies, and other independent third-party sources. Examples of information, but not limited to include: updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and demographic information.

**Security Code**  
It is an important new Internet security feature that now appears on the back of most Visa and MasterCards, and on the front of American Express cards. This new code is a three or four-digit number which provides a cryptographic check of the information embossed on the card. The security code helps validate that the customer placing the online order actually has the credit card in his/her possession, and that the credit/debit card account is legitimate. Click here for image showing location of security code. When you give your Card Security Code to a merchant, you assist the merchant in verifying that the order is being placed by you, the card holder. If this code is printed on your card, YES, you must enter the code. Visa, MasterCard, and American Express now require Internet stores to obtain the security code for all cards that have a code printed on them. In order for a transaction to be accepted and processed, you must enter this code if it's printed on your card. This is done for your protection.
