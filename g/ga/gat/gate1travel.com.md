**Q: What is a cookie and how are they used?**

A: A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a website and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. Gate 1 uses cookies to track banner ads and marketing trends.

**Q: Are there cookies stored in my system when I click on your ads?**

A: We do use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may place cookies on your computer, and appear to be coming from our site, but in reality they are coming from our partners who are serving ads on our  
site. We do not have access to any information about you from cookies you might receive while visiting our site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Be advised that Gate 1 allows other companies that are presenting advertisements or researching users' response to advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Advertisers' and researchers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Gate 1 Privacy Policy.

**Q: What is my security code?**

A: It is an important new Internet security feature that now appears on the back of most Visa and MasterCards, and on the front of American Express cards. This new code is a three or four-digit number which provides a cryptographic check of the information embossed on the card. The security code helps validate that the customer placing the online order actually has the credit card in his/her possession, and that the credit/debit card account is legitimate.

top

**Q: How does my security code protect me?**

A: The security code is only printed the card and it is not contained in the magnetic stripe information nor does it appear on sales receipts or billing statements - you must have the card in your possession in order to use this code. Card Security Codes are not raised, so they are not scanned into standard credit card readers. In theory, these numbers are only visible to you. When you give your Card Security Code to a merchant, you assist the merchant in verifying that the order is being placed by you, the card holder.

top

**Q: Do I have to enter my security code?**

A: If this code is printed on your card, YES, you must enter the code. Visa, MasterCard, and American Express now require Internet stores to obtain the security code for all cards that have a code printed on them. In order for this transaction to be accepted and processed, you must enter this code if it's printed on your card. This is done for your protection.
