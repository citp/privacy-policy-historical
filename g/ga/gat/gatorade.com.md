# Gatorade® Thirst Quencher - The Quaker Oats Company Privacy Policy

**The Quaker Oats Company Privacy Policy**

This web site is operated by The Quaker Oats Company. We recognize that many visitors to our site are concerned about the information they provide to us, and how we treat that information. Our goal at Quaker is to provide safe entertainment and education for you and your kids. Please read on to learn about our Privacy Policy.

**Gathering and Use of Information** **  
** Any personal information collected by Quaker on any of its sites will be used only for internal Quaker use and will not be sold or provided to third parties. Some Quaker sites may collect non-personal information (in the form of aggregated statistics) from you by using "cookie" technology. This information is used internally to better provide services to our consumers. As with the personal information, we do not provide or sell any of these aggregated statistics to any third parties. We will not send you any e-mail unless you ask to be added to our update lists or ask for information from us. If you want to remove your or your childÕs e-mail address from our files, please let us know. Since the information you submit to us may not be encrypted, we cannot guarantee the absolute privacy of that information.

**Kids and Parents  
****Kids** \- If you are 18 years of age or younger, please be sure to ask your parents for permission before providing any information to us.

**Parents -** We hope that you and your kids enjoy our web site. In communicating directly with minors over the Internet, we recognize the unique issues raised regarding the protection of your kids' privacy. The Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU), a section of The Better Business Bureau, has issued guidelines for web sites gathering information from minors. Quaker intends to comply with the CARU guidelines in order to protect your kids and their privacy. On Quaker sites which communicate with kids, we include several notices asking kids to get parental permission before providing any personal information.

**Links**  
Quaker's site may contain "links" to other sites, and we make every effort to only link to sites that share our high standards of decency, fairness, and integrity. We try our best to ensure that these links are safe for kids. However, since we cannot guarantee the content of every site to which we are linked, kids should always check with an adult before linking to any new sites.

**Your Ideas**  
We encourage you to share your comments and questions with us. We promise to read all the mail you send to us, but we may not be able to respond to all of it. However, please note that we assume no responsibility for reviewing unsolicited ideas for our business (like product or advertising ideas) and will not incur any liability as a result of any similarities between your ideas and future Quaker products or programs. This means that we have no obligation to treat your idea submissions confidentially and that we can use them without paying you for them. Any and all idea submissions will be owned by Quaker exclusively and may be used by Quaker for any purpose, now or in the future.

**Use of Materials on this Web Site**  
Please remember that the trademarks, service marks, graphics, text, music and other properties appearing within this web site are protected intellectual properties used by Quaker and/or its related companies. These properties may not be copied, reproduced, republished, uploaded, posted, transmitted or distributed in any way, except that you may, for personal and non-commercial use only, download one copy onto your personal computer. In order to protect these valuable assets, Quaker must prohibit other uses without its prior written consent.
