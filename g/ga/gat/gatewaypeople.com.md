## Introduction

The **_EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR")_** was enacted in the European Union on May 25, 2018, and contained many significant changes to the data protection laws. Based on protecting privacy and taking a risk-based approach, the GDPR has been designed to meet the requirements of the digital age.

Thank you for choosing to be part of Gateway Church ("company", "Church", "we", "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy, and to providing a compliant and consistent approach to data protection. We have always had a robust and effective data protection program in place which complies with existing law and abides by the data protection principles. However, because of the international reach of our church and its associated ministries we are updating and expanding our program to meet the demands of the GDPR.

We are dedicated to safeguarding the personal information under our control and in developing a data protection program that is effective and demonstrates an understanding of, and appreciation for the GDPR. Our preparation and objectives for GDPR compliance have been summarized in this statement and include the development and implementation of new data protection roles, policies, procedures, controls and measures to ensure maximum and ongoing compliance.

If you have any questions or concerns about our Policy or our practice, please contact us at [appsupport@gatewaypeople.com](mailto:%61%70%70%73%75%70%70%6f%72%74@%67%61%74%65%77%61%79%70%65%6f%70%6c%65.%63%6f%6d).

No purpose in this Policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

### 6\. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. The following policies and procedures meet the standards and requirements of the GDPR and any relevant data protection laws, including:

  * **_Data Retention & Erasure_** — our document retention policies and procedures are designed to meet the "data minimization" and "storage limitation" principles and that personal information is stored, archived and destroyed compliantly and ethically. We have dedicated erasure procedures in place to meet the new "Right to Erasure" obligation and are aware of when this and other data subject’s rights apply; along with any exemptions, response timeframes and notification responsibilities.
  * **_Data Breaches_** — our breach procedures ensure that we have safeguards and measures in place to identify, assess, investigate and report any personal data breach at the earliest possible time. Our procedures are robust and have been disseminated to all employees, making them aware of the reporting lines and steps to follow.

  * **_Legal Basis for Processing_** — we are reviewing all processing activities to identify the legal basis for processing and ensuring that each basis is appropriate for the activity it relates to.
