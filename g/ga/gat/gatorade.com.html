We may also collect information about the parts of our app you use or third party apps or websites you visit when you leave our own. We may work with third parties who collect information about you when you use our apps.</p>
<p>Demographic information. We might also ask for information like your gender and age.</p>
<p>Depending on the features you use, we may collect information about your location. When accessing a site or application from a mobile device, we might use cellular tower information to identify your approximate location.

<h2>WE COLLECT INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM YOU, FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND PASSIVELY.</h2>
<p>We collect information directly from you. We might collect information from you when you submit content, post comment, or submit sports and physical activity information.</p>

<p>We use your information for marketing purposes. For example, if we have your contact information, we might send you marketing messages. Third parties we work with may use your UDID to help us serve you with ads targeted to your interests. As otherwise permitted by law.</p>
<h2>WE MAY SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES.</h2>
