# Gateway Official Site: Gateway Computers - Privacy & Data Security

Privacy Statement  
Gateway respects our customers' rights to privacy. We hold your detailed customer information in confidence. This policy applies to information held by Gateway and its affiliated brands, including eMachines, in connection with Gateway's domestic activities.

  
There are times when we may ask our customers for personal information such as your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. This information is used in fulfilling orders made for Gateway as well as sending service e-mails that contain order confirmations and other relevant information about your account. Your name and e-mail address may be collected and used in conjunction with other information, such as your occupation, hobbies and other specifics. This information assists us in offering products and services we think you'd like to hear about. If you prefer not to be contacted, please follow the unsubscribe instructions in the e-mail, or contact Gateway at 800-846-2000.

Gateway also collects purchasing information, including credit card numbers and information used to provide requested services, such as order fulfillment. Information collected with our “E-mail This Page” web feature is used one time for that purpose only.

When we ask for personal information for any reason, we will provide a link to this policy statement to make our intentions clear.

  
If you wish to update or correct the personal information you provided to Gateway, please call 800-846-2000. To add your name to any of the Gateway “Do Not E-Mail” lists for marketing communications, please visit our [Gateway Communication Preferences](https://web.archive.org/about/dnc/index.php?Type=all "Gateway Communication Preferences") page.

  
Gateway will take all appropriate steps to keep your personal information confidential, including limiting access to customer information databases, communicating this policy statement to all Gateway employees, and establishing and enforcing penalties for violating this statement. Additionally, Gateway annually certifies itself to the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor program and ensures its adherence to the Safe Harbor’s standards for privacy protection.

Gateway will not sell, rent or give away customer information to other companies for use in selling others' products or services. We do, however, use third parties to provide us with necessary services such as credit card processing, shipping, credit financing or providing Internet service. When you request a service or purchase a product from Gateway, we will share your personal information as necessary for that third party to provide that service. These third-party service providers are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

We gather personal information from our customers so we can better develop our relationship with those customers. Occasionally, we seek customer comments on our products and services. These comments allow us to determine which products and services our customers should be made aware of based on their specific needs.

We will proactively communicate with customers via e-mail or other online delivery devices to provide offers and information we believe will be of interest. Customers who no longer wish to receive these communications should inform us and we will remove their names from our e-mail lists. Gateway will be judicious in the use of e-mail to communicate with customers, putting ourselves in the place of the recipients of our e-mail and treating our customers as we ourselves would like to be treated. If you would like to be taken off Gateway’s various marketing programs, please [click here to opt out](https://web.archive.org/about/dnc/index.php?Type=all) and enter the information you wish, and you will be unsubscribed as you request.

Our website shares usage information about site visitors with reputable third-party companies for targeting our Internet banner advertisements on this site and other sites, as well as for gathering aggregate information about site traffic and usage. For these purposes, we and our third-party companies note some of the pages you visit on our website using pixel tags (also called transparent gifs). The information collected by our third-party advertisers using these pixel tags is not personally identifiable. Some of the information collected by our third-party analytics provider may be personally identifiable; however, our provider is contractually precluded from selling, licensing or conveying any such information to any third party or from using that information in any way outside Gateway’s own privacy policy. [View more information](http://www.omniture.com/privacy#optout "About Gateway's third-party analytics provider") about our third-party analytics provider, including how to [exclude/include](http://www.omniture.com/optout "Omniture Opt Out") your sessions from data collection.

Notification of Changes  
If we decide to substantively change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of changes to the information we collect, how we use that information, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users by providing 30 days' notice on www.gateway.com.

  
We currently use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to safeguard your information, including your credit card number, during online transactions. None of the tens of thousands of people who have made purchases through Gateway's Web site using SSL has reported to us fraudulent use of their credit card as a result of their online order. We believe SSL to be a very safe encryption method, but we are always looking for even more secure encryption methods to safeguard information sent online. Our server will run detection software to help ensure you are using a secure browser and your information is secure when you check out. If our browser determines you are not using a secure browser, a message will appear at checkout.

Find out more on [SSL technology](https://web.archive.org/about/legal/ssl.php "Info about SSL technology").

To protect your information once your transaction is complete, Gateway stores your information on an offline server stored securely behind our firewall. There is no external access to this information and its internal access is strictly monitored.

For your protection, never put your credit card number or other sensitive information in unencrypted e-mail. In the extremely unlikely event that we ever do suspect a customer's credit card number has been intercepted, we will immediately notify the customer.

  
Gateway helps ensure your protection by offering a safe shopping guarantee. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 in unauthorized or fraudulent charges. Gateway will cover the amount for which you are held liable up to the full $50 if the fraudulent transaction resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at Gateway.com using our secure server. Gateway also requires that you have followed all rules and procedures of your credit card provider relating to fraudulent and authorized use.

  
Gateway currently uses “cookies” on our site. Our cookies tag each visitor's browser with a random, unique number. The cookie simply assigns a number and does not disclose any personal information about the person using the browser. By noting where these uniquely numbered browsers go on our site, we can study traffic patterns and improve our site.
