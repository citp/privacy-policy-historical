	<h1>Gawkk Privacy Policy</h1>
	<a href="/">Home</a> &gt; Site Details &gt; Gawkk Privacy Policy
</div>

<div id="content-main">
	<p>Gawkk was founded on the principles of helping people to discover new
	videos by enabling them to share what they find interesting with one
	another. Gawkk understands that you care about how your personal
	information is used and shared, and we take your privacy very
	seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy
	policy. By visiting the Gawkk website, you are accepting the practices
	outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
	
	<p class="header">What This Privacy Policy Covers</p>
	<p>This policy covers how Gawkk treats personal information that Gawkk
	collects and receives, including information related to your past use
	of the Gawkk service ("Service").  This policy does not apply to the
	practices of companies that Gawkk does not own or control, or to
	people that Gawkk does not employ or manage.</p>
	
	<p class="header">Information Collection and Use</p>
	<p>Personal information is information about you that is personally
	identifiable like your name, age range or email address, and that is
	not otherwise publicly available. Personal information does not
	include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we
	collect about a group or category of products, services or users from
	which individual user identities have been removed. In other words,
	information about how you use a service may be collected and combined
	with information about how others use the same service, but no
	personal information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise,
	information about the products or service you purchase may be
	collected and combined with information about the products or services
	purchased by others. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and
	user needs so that we can better consider new products and services,
	and tailor existing products and services to user desires.</p>
	
	<p>
		Gawkk only collects personal information that is relevant to the
		purpose of our website, which is to enable users to discover and share
		videos with one another. This information allows us to provide you
		with a customized and efficient experience. We do not process this
		information in a way that is incompatible with this objective. We
		collect the following types of information from our Gawkk members:
		
		</p><ol>
			<li>
				<p class="header">Information You Provide to Us:</p>
				<p>
					We receive and store any information you enter on our website or
					provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with
					certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of
					many of our special features.
					
					</p><ul>
						<li>Registration: In order for you to use Gawkk services, such as
						submitting new links to the Service, you must complete a registration
						form. As part of this registration form, we require select personal
						information (including your full name, age range, and e-mail address).</li>
						<li>User Profile: To allow you to express yourself beyond just the
						information collected during registration, we enable you to provide
						additional information, such as a bio, URLs, and any other information
						that you choose to enter. In addition, you may choose to include
						photos of yourself in your profile. As indicated below, you can
						control how your information is displayed and used.</li>
						<li>We also collect personal information from you if you submit a job
						application or resume to us via email. Personal information collected
						in this regard includes your name and email address, as well as other
						employment related information that you provide to us in the resume
						and/or application.</li>
					</ul>
				<p></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="header">Automatic Information</p>
				<p>
					</p><ul>
						<li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you
						interact with us. Gawkk and its authorized agents automatically
						receive and record certain "traffic data" on their server logs from
						your browser including your IP address, Gawkk cookie information, and
						the page you requested. Gawkk uses this traffic data to analyze
						trends, help diagnose problems with its servers and administer the
						website.</li>
						<li>Gawkk may collect and, on any page including user profile pages,
						display the total views, blogs, comments or other activity information
						with respect to a video, user profile, channel or other page.</li>
						<li>Additionally, we use, and allow third parties to use, Web beacons on
						the Site to monitor the effectiveness of advertising or for other
						legitimate purposes. Web beacons are small, graphic images on Web
						pages or Web-based documents or in email messages that allow us or
						third parties to monitor who is visiting the Site or if the email has
						be read. Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the
						Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from
						and the time it was viewed. Web beacons may be linked to your personal
						information.</li>
						<li>We may use third parties, called third-party ad servers or network
						advertisers, to deliver ads to you on our behalf. These third-party ad
						servers may use cookies, Web beacons or other technology to collect
						non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Site
						in order to use it to present advertisements that may be of interest
						to you.</li>
						<li>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites
						anonymously. While Gawkk will not be able to provide you with a
						personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be
						aware that these programs are available.
						E-mail Communications</li>
					</ul>
				<p></p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	<p></p>
	
	<p class="header">E-mail Communications</p>
	<p>Gawkk is very concerned about your privacy and we will never provide
	your email address to a third party without your explicit permission,
	as detailed in the "Sharing Your Information" section below. Gawkk may
	send out e-mails with Gawkk-related news, products, offers, surveys or
	promotions. You may also receive notification e-mails from Gawkk,
	which inform you of actions (e.g. friend requests, subscription
	updates, etc.) that have been performed on the site. If you do not
	want to receive e-mail from us, please visit the email preferences
	section of your User Profile and/or follow the instructions contained
	in the unwanted e-mail message. However, please note that in all cases
	you will continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g. those regarding
	forgotten user passwords) and legal notices from us.</p>
	
	<p class="header">Cookies</p>
	<p>Cookies are small computer files or identifiers that we transfer to
	your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our
	systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in
	our website are visited and by how many people. Gawkk cookies do not
	collect personal information, and we do not combine information
	collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us
	who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.  Most
	browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting
	new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a
	new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you
	leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use more
	Gawkk features.  Some of our business partners, like our advertisers,
	may use cookies on our website. We have no access to, or control over,
	these cookies.</p>
	
	<p class="header">Sharing Your Information</p>
	<p>
		Because Gawkk enables people to discover and share videos with one
		another, information about the people who use Gawkk is an integral
		part of the Gawkk experience. Rest assured that we neither rent nor
		sell your personal information to anyone and that we will share your
		personal information only as described below.
		</p><ul>
			<li><strong>Gawkk Personnel:</strong>
				Gawkk personnel and authorized consultants and/or
				contractors may have access to user information if necessary in the
				normal course of Gawkk business.</li>
			<li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong>
				In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell
				assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically
				one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Gawkk, or
				substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would
				be one of the assets that is transferred.</li>
			<li><strong>Protection of Gawkk and Others:</strong>
				We may release personal information
				when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with
				a law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to
				protect the rights, property, or safety of Gawkk, our employees, our
				users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other
				companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
				reduction.</li>
			<li><strong>User Profile Information:</strong>
				Information collected during registration
				and subsequent visits, such as your full name and location, may be
				displayed to other Gawkk users in your user profile. The user profile
				is the area on Gawkk where we allow you to tell other Gawkk users
				about yourself, your interests and your channels.</li>
			<li><strong>Syndication:</strong>
				Gawkk allows for the RSS syndication of most of its
				public content within the Gawkk website.</li>
			<li><strong>Member Directory:</strong>
				The e-mail address that you submit upon registration
				will be searchable by other Gawkk users who know you by your Gawkk
				username or full name, unless you choose to opt out of this feature.
				This is primarily so that other users can find you to establish
				friendship through Gawkk.</li>
			<li><strong>Friends' Activity:</strong>
				Much like other online social networks, Gawkk
				allows non-friends to browse your friends' activity. Also, another
				Gawkk user can add you as a friend without needing your permission,
				and you may add others as friends without their permission as well.
				When you save a video link to one of your channels, all other members
				that have added you as a friend will be made aware of the addition to
				your channel.</li>
			<li><strong>Social Sharing of Data:</strong>
				Gawkk allows other users to browse videos that
				you have saved to your channel(s), submitted, blogged, or commented
				on. This information is made available via your profile and channel(s)
				and within the permalink URL of the video on which you performed the
				action. Gawkk may choose to post this data on other site features, or
				on widgets posted within other sites.</li>
			<li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong>
				Except as noted above, we will contact you when
				your personal information is shared with third parties or used for a
				purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally
				collected, and you will be able to opt out to prevent the sharing of
				this information.</li>
		</ul>
	<p></p>
	
	<p class="header">Keeping Information Secure</p>
	<p>Your Gawkk account information is protected by a password for your
	privacy and security. Protect against unauthorized access to your
	password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished
	using a shared computer. Only employees who need personal information
	to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service
	representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are
	kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.</p>
	
	<p class="header">Ways to Control Display and Use of Your Information</p>
	<p>As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information,
	but then you may be unable to use certain features on our website,
	such as posting new links. To delete your account, please send a
	request to us at <a href="mailto:support@gawkk.com">support@gawkk.com</a>.
	You can correct, amend, add or delete personal information on our website by 
	visiting your personal profile page. When you update information, however, we 
	often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.  If you do not
	wish to receive e-mail from us or other Gawkk members, please visit
	the email preferences section of your User Profile and/or follow the
	instructions contained in the unwanted e-mail message.  However,
	please note that you will continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g.
	those regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices from us.
	The majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your
	browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell
	you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies.
	Please note, however, that if your browser does not accept cookies,
	you will not be able to take advantage of all Gawkk features.</p>
	
	<p class="header">Links to Other Web Sites</p>
	<p>Our Site contains links to other Web sites. Links from our Site to
	other sites or content are provided for your convenience only, and we
	do not have control over the content or privacy and security practices
	and policies of such third parties or other sites. Any personal
	information you provide on linked pages is provided directly to that
	third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. We
	encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and
	policies before providing them with personal information.</p>
	
	<p class="header">Security</p>
	<p>We use reasonable security measures in an effort to prevent loss,
	misuse and alteration of information under our control. We cannot,
	however, guarantee protection of all information against interception,
	misappropriation, misuse, or alteration, or that your information may
	be not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the
	unauthorized acts of others. Furthermore, we have no control over the
	security of other sites you might visit, interact with or do business
	with.</p>
	
	<p>Your registration information is accessible online only through the
	use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of personal
	information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose
	it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the Site
	by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you
	believe your password has been misused or otherwise misappropriated.</p>
	
	<p class="header">Children Under 18 Years of Age</p>
	<p>You must be 13 years and older to register to use the Gawkk Service.
	If we learn that Gawkk has collected information from a child under
	the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as is
	reasonably possible. We recommend that minors between the ages of 13
	and 18 ask and receive their parents' permission before using Gawkk or
	sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.</p>
	
	<p class="header">Changes to this Privacy Policy</p>
	<p>Gawkk may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, at its sole
	discretion, without notice to you. Use of information we collect now
	is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such
	information is used. If we make changes to the Privacy Policy, we may
	notify you by posting an announcement on the Gawkk website so you are
	always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under
	what circumstances if any, it is disclosed.</p>
	
	<p class="header">Conditions of Use</p>
	<p>If you decide to use the Gawkk Service, your visit and any possible
	dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms
	of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and
	application of New York state law.</p>
	
	<p class="header">Effective Date of this Privacy Policy</p>
	<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 1, 2007.</p>
