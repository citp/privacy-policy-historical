to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and 
persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once the user closes the

file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. 
Persistent cookies can be removed by following the user’s internet 
browser help file directions. We may store a cookie on each user’s 
machine that contains user specific information. You can configure your 
browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a 
cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, you may not be able to take full 
advantage of all offerings. However, not all Services require that you 
accept cookies. Use of the Services may execute code known as a “web 
beacon.” This code allows us to understand the time and date of when a 
user has opened an email. Our web beacons do not collect personally 
identifiable information. </span></div></div>
