When our clients choose to use our personalized services and features, they are required to register with their personal profile on the website. In the process, they may be required to proffer information such as name, gender, birth information, e-mail ID, password, place of residence, postcode, etc. This information is vital for us to create horoscopes and provide accurate personalized reports to our clients. The clients’ e-mail ID and password are used to protect their personal profile. This also makes our personalized e-mail service available to them. Non-personal identifiable information about our clients is collected on the website from their IP address or pages surfed. However, we wish to clarify here that we do not collect any personally-identifiable information about our customers, unless they voluntarily proffer such information, while using our products and services by filling out forms or surveys.

This also ensures that their entire experience with us is more rewarding. 

We have found that customers who have used our services once tend to come back for more, which is precisely because we honour their privacy and confidence in us, and give them exactly the content they ask for, and nothing that is not relevant to their query.

Still, it is pertinent to note, that under certain circumstances such as a court order or under prevailing government norms, we may be compelled to disclose such information. Also, we cannot guarantee that third parties my unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Besides, in cases where we ask our clients for personally identifiable information and notify them that it will be shared with third parties entities, and our customers opt-in to share the information with them, such an opt-in will supersede anything to the contrary contained in this privacy policy.
