NATURE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED

**Personally Identifiable Information**

_Gift Card Orders_. When you place a gift card order on the Site, we ask for your name, company name, address, telephone number, fax number, email address and credit card information, including your credit card number. As mentioned above, this information is processed by a third party service provider, which is the only third party that has access to this information. Our service provider receives this information only for the purpose of processing your order, and is obligated to keep your information confidential. In addition, we ask for the name and address of the individual to whom you would like the cards to be shipped. Gander Mountain may store your information and the information you submit about gift card recipients, such as their name and address. This information will be stored on a secure database and will only be retrieved for inventory purposes and to verify that your order has been fulfilled.

_Employment Applications_. When you submit an employment application to Gander Mountain, you are asked to provide certain information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, social security number, drivers license number, and employment history. If you send an email to inquire about a position with Gander Mountain, the information we receive is the information you include in your cover letter, resume and email message (we will also automatically receive your email address). In either case, we will use this information to match your experience and preferences with the job openings we have, and someone from Gander Mountain may contact you about a possible employment opportunity. The information you submit is used only for recruiting purposes and is not shared with any third party. Please note that by submitting your information regarding employment opportunities with Gander Mountain, you authorize us to transmit and store your information in our recruitment database, and to circulate that information as necessary for the purpose of evaluating your qualifications for job vacancies at Gander Mountain.

_Email Inquiries_. When you email an inquiry to us, we receive your email address and any other information you choose to include in your email. The content of any email inquiries received by Gander Mountain shall be deemed to be non-confidential. Any inquiries or materials sent to Gander Mountain through this Site shall become the sole property of Gander Mountain. Gander Mountain shall be free to use any such inquiries or materials for any and all purposes of its sole choosing, without payment of any compensation.

_Direct Mail_. When you visit the Site you have the opportunity to sign up for Gander Mountain's Gander Guide, an on-line newsletter. The personal information submitted to Gander Mountain shall become the sole property of Gander Mountain. This information will be complied and also used for Gander Mountain's direct mailings. Direct mailings will only be sent to you if you choose to place your name on our mailing list. Please note that we use a third-party company to authenticate and validate the information provided by our customers to make sure our content arrives successfully. We have legally binding agreements with the third-party service provider that prohibits them from using your information for any purpose other than what Gander Mountain instructs them to do with it.

Such information may also be shared with a third party adminstrator of a sweepstakes or other promotion for purposes of such administration. If you do not want to consent to such use, please do not participate in such sweepstakes or other promotions. 

**Automatic Information**

When you visit our Site, we may collect some information automatically, such as your Internet address, the identity of your Internet Service Provider, the Web site from which you linked (if any), and the time and date of your visit. This information is not linked to personally identifiable information. This information is used to compile aggregate statistics about the total number of daily visitors to our Site, the pages most frequently visited and how long you stay at each page. By collecting this information we get a better understanding of your needs and what products and services we can develop to meet those needs. All the information we gather helps us understand your preferences so we can continually improve your online experience with us.

_Internet Protocol Address_. We may use your Internet Protocol address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Site. Your Internet Protocol address is used to help identify you for the duration of a session and to gather broad demographic information. This information will not be sold to any third party.

_Click Stream Data_. As you browse the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each Web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes called "click stream" data, can be collected and stored by a Web site's server. Click stream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use, the address of the Web site from which you linked to the Web Site, and in some instances, your e-mail address. We may use click stream data to determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Site and how they navigate through the Site. We will only use this information to improve the Site. Any collection or use of click stream data will be anonymous and aggregate, and will not contain any personally identifiable information.

_Cookies_. "Cookies" are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive to enable you to more easily communicate and interact with a Web site. We may use cookies to allow you to use our Site more easily and to allow us to keep track of certain statistical information that helps us improve our Site. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You may, however, disallow reception of cookies at any time by resetting your Web browser. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our Sites' best features, so we recommend that you leave them turned on. Gander Mountain will never use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to the Site or your interaction with the Site. Our cookies do not contain personally identifiable information.

### 

THIRD PARTY ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION

**Service Providers**

Our Site may also share information with companies that provide support services to us (such as a printer, credit card processing center, mailing house or web host) or that help us market our products and services. These companies may need information about you in order to perform the services for which we have contracted with them. These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose.

**Protection of Our Site and Others**

We may disclose information you provide to our Site when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law; to enforce or apply our Site Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property or safety of our Site, our users or others.

**Business Transfers**

Information submitted to this Site is an asset of Gander Mountain and will become part of our normal business records. If Gander Mountain or a substantial part of our business is sold or otherwise transferred to a third party, such as a legal successor in interest, your information may be transferred to that third party.

**Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information**

We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. Mere telephone requests will not be honored from any law enforcement agency without some documentation evidencing authorization to receive the information requested.

### 

SECURITY

Our Site uses Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) to encrypt your personal credit information, including your credit card number, before it travels over the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. Because we use SSL, placing an order online at our Site is just as safe as giving your credit card number over the phone.

We have also obtained a Thawte digital security certificate for the purchase of our gift card. Thawte is an independent third party that authenticates the identity of others on the Internet. By registering with Thawte, we provide you a method of independently authenticating that the entity you are dealing with over the Internet is actually Gander Mountain.

### 

LINKS TO AND FROM OTHER WEB SITES

Our Site may offer links to other sites. Other sites have their own policies regarding privacy. If you visit one of these sites, you may want to review the privacy policy on that site. In addition, you may have linked to our Site through another site. For example, in certain cases you may have linked to gandermountain.com through banner advertising on another site. In such cases the site you linked from may collect information from people who click on the banner or link. You may want to refer to the privacy policies on those sites to see how they collect and use this information.

### 

CONSENT

Please check this page periodically for updates. If we ever change our privacy policy, we will post any updates on this page so that you are always aware of the information that we collect and how we use it. Such changes will become effective when posted, and by continuing to use the Site following the posting of any such changes, you agree to be bound by such modified policy.

### 

CHILDREN

The Site is not directed nor targeted to children under the age of 13, and we do not use the Site to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. Because our software does not automatically distinguish visitors under 13 from other visitors, Gander Mountain requires users under 13 years of age to obtain the consent of a parent or guardian to use the Site. If Gander Mountain learns that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Site, it will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from its files.
