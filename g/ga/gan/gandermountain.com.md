**Privacy Notices  
**This Privacy Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by privacy notices (“Privacy Notices”) provided at the time we collect your personal information. For example, certain pages of our Sites may contain Privacy Notices providing details about the personal information we collect on those pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information. Our Privacy Notices are part of this Privacy Policy.

**What Personal Information Do We Collect When You Use Our Sites?  
**_Information You Provide._ We collect the personal information you knowingly provide (using your mouse and keyboard) when you use our Sites. The information we collect depends on how you use our Sites. For example, if you sign up to receive email communications from us, we collect your name and email address and any related information you provide. If you make a purchase at one of our online stores, we collect the information you submit when you place your order, including your credit card and shipping information. If you ship an item to another person, we collect the information you provide about that person, such as their name, address and other contact information.

_Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser._ We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your Web browser. This information typically includes the IP address of your Internet service provider, the name and version of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages you visit. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.

_This information does not identify you personally._ Generally, we use this information to improve our Site and make it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors. In most cases, we do not link the information sent by your browser to information that identifies you personally. We do, however, review our server logs – which contain visitors’ IP addresses -- for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we may share our server logs with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.

_Cookies and Similar Technologies._ We use "cookies" and other Web technologies to collect information and support certain features of our Sites. For example, we may use these technologies to

collect information about the ways visitors use our Sites – which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page;

to support the features and functionality of our Sites – for example, to track the items in your shopping cart; to save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database; and to prompt the settings you established on previous visits to our Sites; and

to personalize your experience when you use our Sites.

Generally, the information we collect using these Web technologies does not identify you personally. If, however, you have created a user identity, for example, by making a purchase or signing up to use a password-protected area of our Sites, we may link this information we collect using Web technologies to other information that identifies you personally.

If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave our Sites. Although you are not required to accept our cookies when you visit our Sites, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of our Sites.

_Supplemental Information._ From time to time, we may supplement the information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or demographic information based on your zip code. We may also supplement the information you give us with information we collect from you through other channels. For example, if you shop at one of our stores, we may supplement the information you provide online with information we collect at the store.

**How Do We Use Your Personal Information?  
**Generally. We use the personal information we collect through our Sites

to provide the information, products and services you request;

for security, credit or fraud prevention purposes;

to provide you with effective customer service; 

to provide you with a personalized experience when you use our Sites;

to contact you with special offers and other information we believe will be of interest to you;

to improve our marketing and promotional efforts; and

for any other purpose identified in an applicable Privacy Notice or other agreement between you and us.

Third-Party Information. If you ship an item to another person, we collect the personal information you provide about him or her and will use that information just as we use your personal information. For example, we may add that person to our catalog mailing list. If that person does not wish to receive catalogs or other promotional communications from us, he or she may contact us using the contact information provided in the catalog, on each electronic communication or on our Sites.

Employment Information. Some of our Sites include “careers” areas. When you use our Sites to search for job openings or submit an online employment application, we may ask you to provide certain personal information, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, educational background and employment history. You may also send us your resume and other information relating to your job search or application. We use the information you submit on the careers area of our Sites only for recruiting and employment purposes, we do not use it for marketing purposes. Please note that by submitting personal information to us through the careers area of one of our Sites, you authorize us to transmit and store your information in our recruitment database and to circulate that information within the Gander Mountain family of businesses for the purpose of evaluating your qualifications for job vacancies. If you are hired by one of us, the information you provide during the recruiting process will become part of our employee records. The careers areas of our Sites may be “powered” by a third-party service provider.

**With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?  
**_Service Providers._ We may share personal information collected through our Sites with companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf, for example, companies that provide support services to us (such as credit card verification services, online recruiting services, and web hosting services) or that help us market our products and services (such as third-party web analytics firms and marketing consultants).

_With Other Members of the Gander Mountain Family of Businesses._ When you provide personal information through one of our Sites, the owner of that Site may share your personal information with other members of the Gander Mountain family of businesses. Every member of the Gander Mountain family of businesses is required to handle information collected through our Sites in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us. Accordingly, if we share your personal information with other members of the Gander Mountain family of businesses, they will use your information only as permitted under this Privacy Policy and will honor the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.

_With Carefully Selected Third Parties._ From time to time we may share our mailing lists with carefully selected third parties (outside the Gander Mountain family of businesses) for their own marketing purposes. For example, we exchange our catalog mailing lists with other catalog companies. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these third parties, please let us know by following the procedure described below under "Your Choices".

_Business Transactions._ We may decide, for strategic or other reasons, to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize one or more of our businesses. A transaction of this type may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective purchasers. In such cases, we will take reasonable measures to protect the personal information we disclose, for example, by requiring the prospective purchaser to sign a non-disclosure agreement limiting the use and protecting the confidentiality of the personal information.

_Business Transfers._ Your personal information may be transferred to a company that has acquired the stock or assets of a member of the Gander Mountain family of businesses or one of its businesses, for example, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company’s use of your personal information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.

_Compliance With Laws and Protection of Our Rights and the Rights of Others._ We may disclose personal information when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose personal information to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce or apply our online Terms and Conditions or other agreements; or to protect our own rights or property or the rights, property or safety of our users or others.

**Your Choices  
**_In General._ We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use and disclose your personal information. In most cases, we will ask you to indicate your choices at the time we collect your personal information. We will also include an “opt-out” link in each electronic newsletter or promotional email we send you, so that you can inform us that you do not wish to receive such communications from us in the future.

_You May Ask Us to Remove Your Personal Information from Our Mailing Lists._ If at any time you wish to be taken off our mailing lists, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact.shtml). Please provide your full name, postal address and email address so that we can find you on our mailing lists.

Please give us a reasonable amount of time to honor your request.

_You May Ask Us Not to Share Your Personal Information With Third Parties for Their Marketing Purposes._ If you do not want us to share your personal information with third parties (outside the Gander Mountain family of businesses) to use for their marketing purposes, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact.shtml). Please provide your full name, postal address and email address so that we can find you on our mailing lists. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to honor your request.

If this happens to you, please contact the third party directly and ask to be removed from its mailing lists.

**How Can You Access, Update or Correct Your Personal Information?  
**Some of our Sites have links that permit you to manage your subscriptions or access and update some of your personal information. In most cases, however, you will need our help.

We will respond to you within a reasonable time and, in any case, within the time limits established by applicable law. We may ask you for additional information to verify your identity.

In some cases, however, we may limit or deny your request if the law permits or requires us to do so or if we are unable to verify your identify.

**Security  
**_How Do We Protect Personal Information?_ We take reasonable precautions to provide a level of security appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal information we collect. For example, we use SSL encryption to protect your credit card information as it travels over the Internet. Although we use reasonable measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized use or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of information provided over the Internet or stored in our databases.

_Password Protected Areas of Our Sites._ For your protection, certain areas of our Sites may be password protected. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your passwords.
