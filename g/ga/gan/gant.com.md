We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personal Information, except as set forth in this policy. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our Website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties are bound by confidentiality requirements. We may also release your Personal Information and Non-Personal Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our or others' rights, property, or safety. Non-Personal Information of our Website visitors may also be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses as we see fit in our business. Your information, both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information, may be transferred or shared in the event that the Company undergoes a corporate event, such as a restructuring (including in the event of bankruptcy), merger, divestiture, reorganization, dissolution or other sale of our Company's assets or stock, or other event giving rise to a change of control of our Company.

#### How do we protect your information?

We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. All Personal Information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls, and any payment transactions will be encrypted. Keep in mind, however, that the safety and security of your information also depends on you; where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect it, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your Personal Information. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.
