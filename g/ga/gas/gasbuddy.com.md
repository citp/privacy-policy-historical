### Information Collected By Cookies And Similar Technologies

In some cases, we may use cookies and similar technologies, such as pixel tags, that automatically collect information. Cookies are small files, typically of letters and numbers, downloaded onto your computer or mobile device when you visit certain websites. When you return to these websites, or visit other websites that use the same cookies, the websites recognize these cookies and your browsing device. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive or read cookie files created by other websites. 

Pixel tags are very small images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as “web beacons” or “clear GIFs,” that can recognize cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar information from your computer or device. 

We generally treat information collected by cookies and other tracking technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we treat cookie information with identifiers as personal information. 

Information that may be collected by cookies when you use the Service may include, without limitation: 

  * the pages you visit within the Service; 
  * the date and time of your visit to the Service; 
  * the amount of time you spend using the Service; 
  * the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; and/or 
  * your computer and connection information such as your browser type and version, operating system and platform.



Some of the functions performed by cookies are strictly necessary for us to be able to offer you our Service, while other cookies provide us with valuable insight about how we can improve our Service or help us with marketing our products and services to you based on your interests and preferences. 

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device until they expire or are deleted (i.e. after you have finished browsing). 

#### First and Third Party Cookies

When you access our Services, we or companies we work with may place cookies on your computer or other device. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, and inform us about which parts of our websites people have visited. 

We use both first-party and third-party cookies on our Service. First-party cookies are cookies that are placed on your device by us, while third-party cookies are set by parties other than GasBuddy. Third-party cookies are operated by third parties that can recognize your device both when it visits our Service and when it visits other websites or mobile apps. GasBuddy does not control how third-party cookies are used, and we encourage you to check the websites of any third-party cookie providers for more information about how they use cookie information. 

#### Advertising Tracking Technology and Analytics

GasBuddy uses third party service providers to display advertising on our Services and serve advertising on other third party sites that are more relevant to you or your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement, as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other organizations, such as advertisers. This means that after you have used our Services, you may see some advertisements about our Services elsewhere on the Internet. The information collected through this process by the third party service providers does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personal information that directly identifies you unless you choose to provide these. Such advertising will only be delivered where permitted by applicable law. 

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. The cookies and other technologies used by Google may collect personal information, but GasBuddy does not use Google Analytics to gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s privacy policies. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout> or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. 

#### Managing Cookies, Similar Technologies and Targeted Online Advertising.

  * Our Cookies ("First-Party Cookies"). You can use the browser with which you are viewing this website to enable, disable or delete cookies. To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the "Help", "Tools" or "Edit" settings). Please note, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access secure areas of the Site. Also, if you disable cookies other parts of the Services may not work properly. You can find more information about how to change your browser cookie settings at [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).
  * Third-Party Cookies. To opt-out of third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use targeting/advertising cookies, go to <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>. Once you click the link, you may choose to opt-out of such advertising from all participating advertising companies or only advertising provided by specific advertising entities. For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, please see <http://www.aboutads.info/consumers>.
  * Mobile Advertising. You can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for certain types of advertising by accessing the settings in mobile device and following the instructions. If you opt-out, we will remove all data about you and will not collect any further data. The random ID previously assigned to you will be removed. Thus, if at a later stage, you decide to opt-in, we will be unable to continue and track you using the prior ID and you will for all practical purposes be a new user.
  * Do Not Track. Some Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit "Do Not Track" or "DNT" signals. Since uniform standards for DNT signals have not been adopted, our Sites do not currently process or respond to DNT signals.
  * Flash Cookies. If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the website storage settings panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the global storage settings panel and following the instructions. Setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.

GasBuddy’s B2B Software-as-a-Service ( **SaaS** ), (collectively, the “ **Enterprise Services** ”), is designed to provide gas retailers a platform to maintain their station information, manage their brand, promote to their target consumer audience and measure success of their ads.
