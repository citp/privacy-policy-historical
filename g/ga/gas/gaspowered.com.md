### Q2

| 

**What types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our guests?**  
  
---|---  
  
### A2

| 

We collect several types of personally identifiable information about our guests. Personal information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you.

### Children

We don't collect any personal information from children 13 and younger.

### Information You Provide to Us

All of the personal information we receive comes directly from our adult guests. We collect personal information from our guests to:

  1. Register for our website
  2. Newsletter subscription
  3. Message boards and chat rooms
  4. "Tell-a-friend" or "Email this page" features
  5. Polls, surveys, or questionnaires
  6. Demo downloads
  7. Technical support



Typically, this information includes name, email address, telephone number, ICQ, AIM, and MSN contact information. Additionally, we may also collect other types of non-personal information (known as demographic information) such as your age, date of birth, or hobbies and interests.

We don't require personal information to access our site. However, if you prefer not to disclose personal information, you will not be able to enjoy certain features of our site.

Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.

### Business Information

For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in a business capacity (like job inquiries) different from information we receive in a non-business capacity. Personal information submitted to us in a business capacity may be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry.

### Information Collected Through Technology

We collect information through technology to make our sites more interesting and useful to you. For example, when you come to one of our sites, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information.

### Cookies

Our Websites also use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a Website sends to your computer while you are viewing the Website. We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For example, when you return to one of our sites after logging in, cookies provide information to the site so that the site will remember who you are. 

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly. 

Finally, once you've clicked on a hyperlink and have left our Websites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the owners to see how your personal information will be handled on their site.

### Q3

| 

**How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?**  
  
---|---  
  
### A3

| 

As described in detail below, we do not disclose your personal information to third parties.

### Partners

We don't disclose your personal information to our partners. However, we may share aggregate consumer data - which does not contain any personal information - with our partners.

We may also use your personal information for other purposes such as "Operational Uses." For example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our Websites, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy.

Finally, we may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and we may use and share in any way with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information.

### Purchase or Sale of Businesses

From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale. If we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so. If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy), if it is practicable and permissible to do so. The provisions of this paragraph will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.

Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Websites and Others 

We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of our Websites or third parties.

The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and improper use.
