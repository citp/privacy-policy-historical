 **Why we collect this information and How we use it**

We collect personal information from you so we can process orders placed and keep you updated on their progress. Only where you have specifically requested will we use any information collected to contact or update you with marketing communications relating to products or services. When you submit an order with us your personal details may be shared internally with our sales staff, customer service staff and warehouse staff and to fulfil the delivery of your order your personal details may be shared with any relevant third-party courier companies (Fedex, DPD, UK Mail, DHL or Royal Mail) or product suppliers/distributors. 

Where you have specifically requested to join our email marketing list your personal details will be shared with our third party email service provider Pure360 Ltd (you can view the full Pure360 Ltd Privacy Policy - <https://www.pure360.com/privacy/>). When you request to receive email marketing from GAK in the form of newsletters, product updates and information, promotional offers and discounts etc we will not share your email address with any other third parties for marketing purposes.

Our legal basis for collecting and processing your personal information is generally that we either have your explicit consent, that we require this information in order to perform a contract with you or that we have a legitimate business interest to do so.

 **How long we store the information we collect**

Where we process your information in order to fulfil an order for goods or services, we will securely store your information as long as is necessary for warranty, financial and tax storage requirements. Once we no longer have a legitimate business need to store or process your personal information we will delete or remove it at the earliest opportunity.

Where we process your personal information in order to keep you updated about products and services we will retain and process that information indefinitely unless you notify us that you no longer wish to receive these communications.

The information we collect may be stored and processed in various locations, this will not include locations outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

 **Who we may Share your personal information with**

In order to fully process and deliver orders placed we will share relevant personal information with third parties where required and where you have opted-in to our marketing updates we will share relevant personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. 

You personal information may be shared with:

  * Delivery and logistics partners to facilitate the delivery of your goods.
  * Email service providers that enable us to send relevant marketing email communications.
  * Server management and data storage providers that host and manage our secure website and business software applications.
  * Payment service providers that enable payments online through our website, payment links or over the phone.
  * Suppliers and/or Distributors to facilitate direct shipment of goods from third party warehouses to customers. 



Any of our business partners mentioned above may have a legitimate business need to store your personal information for a period of time. We recommend that you review their privacy policies, where requested we will assist in accessing copies of any third party Privacy Policy. Please contact our Data Protection Officer for further information.

Where we use any third-party to process personal information on our behalf, we have drafted compliant processor agreements and due diligence procedures for ensuring that they (as well as we) meet and understand their/our Data Protection Legislation obligations. These measures include reviews of the service provided, the necessity of the processing activity, the technical and organisational measures in place and compliance with Data Protection Legislation.
