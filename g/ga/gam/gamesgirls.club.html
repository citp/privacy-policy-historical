            <br>
            When you visit GamesGirls.club we collect some information from you. We
            collect no personally identifiable information such as your name,
            address, phone number, or e-mail address unless you willingly submit
            it to us via registration or contact. Some types of non-personally
            identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you
            use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of
            computer operating system you use is collected upon your visit to our
            site in order to provide our advertisers with targeting information.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Cookies and data collected:</b>
            <br>
            GamesGirls.club collects information about the way visitors and players are using our website 
            through the use of Google Analytics and its related cookie(s). The goal of collecting this data is 
            to make better informed decisions about what games our users are more likely to enjoy and to help 
            improve the experience on GamesGirls.club. The type of information that Google Analytics collects includes 
            browser and operating system type, country, pages visited, time spent on site, date/time stamp and broad 
            demographic information. Google Analytics does not collect any personally identifiable information about 
            you on GamesGirls.club.<br>
            <br>
            Certain games on GamesGirls.club will create "Local shared objects" which allow the game to save game progress 
            so that when you return you can pick up from where you left off. Any game save data is stored only on your 
            computer and not transferred to GamesGirls.club or any other third party. Some games from third-party publishers 
            that are included on GamesGirls.club may offer the ability to save game-progress in the cloud via third-party servers, 
            in which the storage and retrieval of such data is dictated by the privacy policy of such game publisher offering the service.

            <b>External Links:</b>
            <br>
            GamesGirls.club may link to other web sites and is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of these external sites. 
            Some games on GamesGirls.club also contain links to external sites or may contain requests for personal information 
            for gameplay purposes (e.g. account registration or chatroom features) which are governed by their own individual 
            privacy policies. All users should therefore also be aware of the individual privacy policies within any game that 
            requests personal information such as name or email address.
