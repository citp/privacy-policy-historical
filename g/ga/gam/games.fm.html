<pre>	Privacy
We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.

(1)	Which information do we collect?

We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:

(2)	Cookies

A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.

Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector.)

(d)	to the purchaser (or prospective purchaser) of any business or asset which we are (or are contemplating) selling.
