# Privacy Policy – Gamer Escape

This policy explains in detail how Gamer Escape (as that term is defined by the Terms of Service) uses any information collected during any session of usage by you (hereinafter “your information”). If you only read Gamer Escape, no more information is collected than is typically collected in server logs by web sites in general. If you contribute to the Gamer Escape wikis or  other interactive areas, you are publishing every word you post publicly. If you write something, assume that it will be retained forever. This includes articles, user pages and talk pages. Some limited exceptions are described below.

### Account Creation

If you create an account, it will, at a bare minimum, contain a uniquely identifiable name (hereinafter “your user name”), a personal password used for logging into your account (hereinafter “your password”) and a personal, valid e-mail address (hereinafter “your e-mail”). Your information for your account at Gamer Escape is protected by data-protection laws applicable in the country that hosts us. Any information beyond your user name, your password, and your e-mail address required by Gamer Escape during the registration process is either mandatory or optional, at the discretion of Gamer Escape.  Your user name will be publicly displayed.  Furthermore, within your account, you have the option to opt-in or opt-out of automatically generated e-mails from the mediawiki software.  If you edit the wiki anonymously, the mediawiki software will publish your IP address.

Your password is ciphered (a one-way hash) so that it is secure. However, it is recommended that you do not reuse the same password across a number of different websites. Your password is the means of accessing your account at Gamer Escape, so please guard it carefully and under no circumstance will anyone affiliated with Gamer Escape, or another 3rd party, legitimately ask you for your password. Should you forget your password for your account, you can use the “I forgot my password” feature provided by the mediawiki software. This process will ask you to submit your user name and/or your e-mail, then the mediawiki software will generate a new password to reclaim your account.

Many aspects of the Gamer Escape’s community interactions depend on the reputation and respect that is built up through a history of valued contributions. User passwords are the only guarantee of the integrity of a user’s edit history. All users are encouraged to select strong passwords and to never share them. No one shall knowingly expose the password of another user to public release either directly or indirectly.

### Cookies

By browsing Gamer Escape will cause the mediawiki and/or wordpress software to create a number of cookies, which are small text files that are downloaded on to your computer’s web browser temporary files. We may also create cookies external to this software whilst browsing other areas of the Site.  You may clear these cookies at any time in your browser settings.  In addition, various ad providers may use cookies related to advertisements shown on the site.

### Publishing or Submitting Data

When you edit any page in a wiki, you are publishing a document. This is a public act, and you are identified publicly with that edit as its author. You may elect to be logged in with a user name to publish a page in a Gamer Escape wiki. Your user name may be your real name if you so choose, or you may choose to publish under a pseudonym, whatever user name you selected when you created your account. When using a pseudonym, your IP address will not be available to the public except in cases of abuse, including vandalism of a wiki page by you or by another user with the same IP address. In all cases, your IP address will be stored on the wiki servers and can be seen by Gamer Escape’s administrators. Your IP address, and its connection to any usernames that share it may be released under certain circumstances (see below).  Remember to log out or disconnect yourself after each session using a pseudonym on a shared computer, to avoid allowing others to use your identity.

Many people refer to IP editing as “anonymous editing.” But in reality, IP editing is less anonymous than registering a username. IP addresses in many cases can be traced to an exact location.  If you elect to edit in this fashion, your IP address will be publicly visible.

### Release of Page Log Data

Every time you visit a web page, you send a lot of information to the web server. Most web servers routinely maintain access logs with a portion of this information, which can be used to get an overall picture of what pages are popular, what other sites link to this one, and what web browsers people are using. It is not the intention of Gamer Escape to use this information to keep track of legitimate users.

Log data is maintained and may be examined by developers in the course of solving technical problems and in tracking down badly-behaved web spiders that overwhelm the site. IP addresses of users, derived either from those logs or from records in the database are frequently used to correlate usernames and network addresses of edits in investigating abuse of a wiki, including the suspected use of malicious “sockpuppets” (duplicate accounts), vandalism, harassment of other users, or disruption of a wiki.

It is the policy of Gamer Escape that personally identifiable data collected in the server logs, or through records in the database via the CheckUser feature, may be released by the system administrators or users with CheckUser access, in the following situations:

  1. In response to a valid subpoena or other request from law enforcement;
  2. With permission of the affected use;
  3. To the site’s administrators when necessary for investigation of abuse complaints;
  4. Where the information pertains to page views generated by a spider or bot and its dissemination is necessary to illustrate or resolve technical issues;
  5. Where the user has been vandalizing articles or persistently behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released to assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers; and
  6. Where it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of the Gamer Escape, its users or the public.



We may also share with third parties aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of new user registrations over a specific time period or the number of users who edited a wiki, or non-personal information in order to sell advertising on the site.

### Security of Information

While Gamer Escape respects your privacy and will act in accordance with this policy, it makes no guarantee against unauthorized access to any information you provide. This information may be available to anyone with access to the servers, though rarely accessed except in cases such as solving technical problems.

### Removal of Accounts and Deletion of Content

Once created, user accounts may not be able to be removed or renamed.

Removing text from Gamer Escape wiki projects does not permanently delete it. In normal articles, anyone can look at a previous version and see what was there. If an article is “deleted”, any user with “administrator” access on a wiki, meaning almost anyone trusted not to abuse the deletion capability, can see what was deleted. Information can be permanently deleted by administrators with the oversight right, but there is no guarantee this will happen except in response to legal action or to protect the privacy of the end user (e.g. such as the unwarranted posting of addresses or phone numbers).
