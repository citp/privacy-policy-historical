This Privacy Policy applies to the web sites owned by GameBattles, Inc. including GameBattles.com, Socom2Battles.com, MaddenBattles.com, FifaBattles.com, SocomBattles.com and GhostReconBattles.com. We refer to these web sites as the GameBattles Sites.

No computer system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard. But GameBattles is committed to providing reasonable and appropriate security controls to protect our web sites and their information against foreseeable hazards.

When you register for membership on an GameBattles Site or activate a service by clicking on a particular service link (i.e. email) on our sites, you may be automatically registered to receive the free services we offer and some of your Personally Identifiable Information may be transferred from GameBattles to those third-party service providers.

In some instances where GameBattles provides co-registration, the co-registration partners allow you to opt-out of their membership. If you choose to co-register with our partners and accept their terms of service, then you are automatically registered as a member of their select web sites and your Personally Identifiable Information is transferred to those organizations. As a result, you mayreceive information from one of these web sites as any of their members would. We advise you to review their privacy and data collection policies for further information.

It is important to remember that taking these surveys and polls is entirely optional. You have no obligation to respond to them.

We also store some of the information that our users provide in these surveys to help us understand your interests and to make the site more useful for you.

F. Use of Cookies. On the Internet, a "cookie" is a piece of information (a file) that a Web site transfers to a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common on the Internet. The process we use to serve advertisements and to track use of our site involves cookies. Cookies help GameBattles and our advertising service (discussed below) track the frequency and placement of advertisements. Cookies also enable us to measure aggregate, or total usage and traffic to our site and to specific offerings. This aids us in producing content that best meets our users' preferences. In order to implement new services, we may use other types of cookies as well. We also may use cookies to understand better what parts of our site you like best. We may use that information to display advertisements that we think will be of particular interest to you. You may configure your browser to reject cookies, but this may interfere with some functionality of the GameBattles Sites. To find out more about changing your browser to reject cookies, we suggest the EPIC Cookies Page [http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies].
