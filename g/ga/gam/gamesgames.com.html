            <p>This privacy policy (hereafter referred to as the "Privacy Policy") is applicable to our websites and to all games and other activities that are offered by us on or through our websites. (Our websites, all the web pages that are part of the websites, and such games and activities are hereafter collectively referred to as the "Websites.") SPIL GAMES BV, having its registered office at Arendstraat 23, 1223 RE, Hilversum, the Netherlands (hereafter referred to as "SPIL"), is the responsible party as referred to in the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act (Wet Bescherming Persoonsgegevens). SPIL may use affiliates' or reputable third parties' services for the processing of personal data collected on or through the Websites. By using or accessing our Websites, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>1.	About Our Websites</h2>
<p>1.1	Our Websites offer a diverse, current, and exciting mix of online games created by SPIL, as well as games created by independent developers and SPIL partners. Players can access our Websites to play games without registering; however, they may choose to register to create a public or semi-public profile and to save games, high scores, and comments on this profile. Also, visitors to the Websites will be able to rate games and browse for the newly added, top-rated, and most-popular games.</p>
<h2>2.	The Information We Collect</h2>
<p>The information that our Websites collect includes (among others) the following:</p>
<h2>a) IP address, Cookies, and Web Beacons </h2>
<p>2.1	When you visit our Websites, our servers automatically save your computer's IP address. IP addresses will be collected, along with information about the actual web pages that you visit on the Websites. If you arrive at the Websites via a link from another website, the URL of the linking website and the URL of any website that you link to next will also be collected.</p>
<p>2.2	In addition, we store certain information from your browser, using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer and is tied to information about the user. SPIL may use cookies, web beacons (web bugs), or similar technologies to enhance and personalize your experience on the Websites, including the following:</p><p>
</p><ul>
	<li>(a) to operate and improve offerings on the Websites;</li>
	<li>(b) to help authenticate you when you are on the Websites;</li>
	<li>(c) to remember your preferences and registration information, as applicable;</li>
	<li>(d) to present and help measure and research the effectiveness of SPIL's offerings, advertisements, and email communications; and </li>
	<li>(e) to customize the content and advertisements provided to you through the Websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.3	SPIL may also use ad network providers to help present advertisements on the Websites. These ad network providers use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to help the presenting, better targeting, and measuring of the effectiveness of their advertisements, using data gathered over time and across their networks of web pages to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their audiences. SPIL offers some services in connection with other websites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to SPIL in order to deliver these services. SPIL processes such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>2.4	SPIL may also use third-party payment service providers ("PSP"), offering payment transaction services to SPIL in order to sell a product or service through the Websites. Whenever you buy something from the Websites (e.g., a virtual game item or a subscription for a game download), the information that you provide to the PSP is subject to their privacy policies, not ours. You explicitly consent that SPIL may provide personal information collected from you to a PSP for the purpose of the offering of the payment-transaction service whenever you buy something from the Website(s) and that such PSP may use such data for (statistical) analysis of payment transactions. SPIL shall be allowed to notify a PSP regarding a user that engages in (or who a party believes has engaged in) any activity that is illegal, that violates any person's rights, or that led to such user's suspension or termination of use of the Websites.</p>
<p>2.5	SPIL may share demographic information (certain anonymous information about you as a user, such as age and country) with certain ad network providers to help them deliver more relevant advertisements through their ad networks. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by such third parties as ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can (re)set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. You can opt out of receiving cookies from certain third-party advertising networks by resetting your browser. You may also use the following link to the Network Advertising Initiatives cookies <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">opt-out page</a> or the link to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com">opt-out page</a> . However, some features and services may not function properly if cookies are disabled.</p>
<p>2.7	You may choose to register with us for a better game experience and/or to create a public or semi-public profile for participating in our social gaming network. This includes, for example: overviews of high scores, achievements listings, and individual game recommendations on the Websites. When you register with us, you provide us with certain personal information, such as a username, date and month of birth, and your email address. The information you disclose in that respect may also become publicly accessible. We provide you with privacy settings that restrict other users from accessing your information; namely, our network architecture and your privacy settings allow you to make informed choices about who has access to your information. We allow you to choose the information you provide to friends and networks through our Websites. When your privacy settings permit it, other users may be able to see and supplement your profile (e.g., by posting comments).</p>
<p>2.8	If you decide to disclose information in a public venue or in games, we will consider that information as part of the public domain. This information will be accessible to any person who uses the Websites.</p>
<p>2.9	We only collect email addresses that were provided to us directly by you. Your email address will only be used for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>(i) the promotion of (new) games;</li>
	<li>(ii) service emails (on updates, new design, new features, etc.);</li>
	<li>(iii) administrative purposes, such as notification of violation of our Terms of Use;</li>
	<li>(iv) delivering messages you have allowed us to pass on (e.g., from other people in your social network).</li>
</ul>
<p>2.10 Without your approval, we will not:</p>
<ul>
	<li>(a) make your email address visible on the Website;</li>
	<li>(b) use your email address for purposes other than those described in article 2.9 hereof;</li>
	<li>(c) transfer your email address or other personal information to third parties, except in those limited cases as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>c) Combination of Personal Data</h2>
<p>2.11 For optimizing our services and the Websites, and for the purposes mentioned in this article 2, we are entitled to combine your personal data (including your email address, as applicable) with other information about you collected by or provided to us.</p>
<h2>3. To Whom Does SPIL Provide This Information?</h2>
<p>3.1	SPIL may provide information to any party whose services it engages for the purposes of its normal operations (for example, those partners who assist us by providing technical or operational facilities for the Websites and so forth). We may also supply information to other parties if we are required to do so by law or by a ruling handed down by a court of law. SPIL does not provide personal details to other parties for commercial, advertising, or marketing purposes, except if you explicitly give us permission to do so, or if doing so is part of a specific program or operation for which you have registered. In such case, you may withdraw your permission at any time.</p>
<h2>4. Why Do We Collect Information?</h2>
