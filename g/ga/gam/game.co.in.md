  * privacy policy



SPIL Games BV (hereafter referred to as "SPIL"), is dedicated to protecting the privacy of our users and handling any personal date we obtain from our users with care and respect. An overall principle is that we do not collect more information than is reasonably necessary to provide you with the best user experience.

This privacy policy (hereafter referred to as the "Privacy Policy") is applicable where SPIL acts as a data controller with respect to your data. This is the case where we determine the purposes and means of the data processing on our websites, which includes certain games and other activities that are offered by us on or through our websites. Our websites, all the web pages that are part of the websites, and such games and activities are hereafter collectively referred to as the "Websites."

SPIL GAMES BV, having its registered office at Mussenstraat 15, 1223 RB, Hilversum, the Netherlands (hereafter referred to as "SPIL"), may use affiliates' or reputable third parties' services for the processing of personal data collected on or through the Websites. By using or accessing our Websites, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## 1\. About Our Websites

1.1 Our Websites offer a diverse, and exciting mix of online games created by SPIL, as well as games created by independent developers and SPIL partners. Players can access our Websites to play games without registering; however, they may choose to register to create a public or private profile and to save games, high scores, and comments on this profile. Also, visitors to the Websites will be able to rate games and browse for the newly added, top-rated, and most-popular games. The Websites may include automated decision making in the form of behavioral advertising.

1.2 Certain games on our Websites are controlled by third parties, including third parties located outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). SPIL’s own hosting facilities for the Websites are located within the EEA. SPIL uses commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any data processing that takes place on the Websites is in line with the applicable data protection laws. Privacy safeguards we take are contractual safeguards with third parties and the employment of technical privacy solutions, such as monitoring and blocking tools. However, as we do not control all games, data may be collected and transferred of which we are not aware. If you have concerns about data processing in a game, please send an e-mail to [info@spilgames.com](mailto:info@spilgames.com) stating your concerns and the URL of the games.

If you arrive at the Websites via a link from another website, the URL of the linking website and the URL of any website that you link to next will also be collected for the purpose of assessing our main traffic sources, and debugging and tracing.

2.3 In addition, we store certain information from your browser, using “cookies”. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the computer and is tied to information about the user. We will ask you to consent to the use of our Cookies in accordance with this Privacy Policy in case this is required under the applicable data protection laws when you first use our Websites. SPIL may use cookies, web beacons (web bugs), or similar technologies to enhance and personalize your experience on the Websites, including the following:

  1. to operate and improve services and features on the Websites;
  2. to help authenticate you when you are on the Websites;
  3. to remember your preferences and registration information, as applicable;
  4. to present and help measure and research the effectiveness of SPIL's offerings, advertisements, and email communications; and
  5. to customize the content and advertisements provided to you through the Websites.



If you do not want SPIL to store any cookies on your computer, you can prevent this by changing your browser settings to “do not accept cookies”. Your browser manufacturer will provide you more details on how this works. However, we do inform you that you will not be able to use the Websites including its functionalities as intended. If you want to learn more about SPIL’s use of Cookies, please click [here](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy) for our cookie policy.

These analytics partners process Usage Data which may include among others your IP address, geographical location, browser type and version, operating system, length of visit, page views and other information about how you use and navigate the Websites. This data is used to analyze the use of the Websites and to improve the Websites and services. Our analytics partners will act as a data processor in relation to the Usage Data. The legal basis for the processing of the Usage Data is legitimate interest.

2.5 SPIL also uses ad network providers, ad exchanges and ad servers (“Advertising Partners”) to help present advertisements on the Websites. These Advertising Partners use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies for presenting, better targeting, and measuring the effectiveness of their advertisements, using data gathered over time and across their networks of web pages to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their audiences (“Advertising Data”). SPIL processes such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Our Advertising Partners may act as a data processor or data controller with regards to the Advertising Data, depending on the scope of their services. The Advertising Partners are responsible for their compliance with the applicable data protection legislation. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by such third parties as ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy. The legal basis for the processing of the Advertising Data is consent.

2.6 SPIL uses Facebook technology to provide certain services on the Websites. The Websites may include the “Facebook Like Button” which is controlled by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA (Facebook). In the event you click on the Facebook Like Button, Facebook will ask you whether you want to log in to Facebook if you are not logged in at that moment, or register with Facebook. If you decide to do so, your personal data will be transferred to Facebook. In the event you are already logged into your Facebook account and you have given SPIL your explicit consent to the sharing of your information with Facebook, your information is shared with Facebook when visiting the Websites or playing games including the “Facebook Like Button”.  
The Websites also use the “Facebook Pixel” controlled by Facebook in order to show conversions, create “lookalike audiences” and provide SPIL with relevant statistics about our Websites in order to improve them. When you use our websites and you have given SPIL your explicit consent to the sharing of your information with Facebook, your information is automatically shared with Facebook.  
For more information on the “Facebook Like Button” and “Facebook Pixel” and sharing and use of your personal data please consult Facebook’s Data Policy at: <https://www.facebook.com/policy.php>.

2.7 SPIL may also use third-party payment service providers ("PSP"), offering payment transaction services to SPIL in order to sell a product or service through the Websites. The PSP acts a data controller with regards to the personal data related to the transactions (“transaction data”) processed for the purpose of purchasing the product or service. The transaction data may include your personal details, your payment card details, and the transaction details. Whenever you buy something from the Websites (e.g., a virtual game item), the information that you provide to the PSP is subject to their privacy policies, not ours. The legal basis for this processing is the performance of a contract. You explicitly consent that SPIL may provide personal information collected from you to a PSP for the purpose of the offering of the payment-transaction service whenever you buy something from the Website(s) and that such PSP may use such data for (statistical) analysis of payment transactions. After you have purchased a product or service, SPIL and the PSP have a legal requirement to retain your information for a legally determined period of at least 7 years. SPIL shall be allowed to notify a PSP regarding a user that engages in (or who a party believes has engaged in) any activity that is illegal, that violates any person's rights, or that led to such a user's suspension or termination of use of the Websites.

2.8 SPIL uses third party service providers in order to offer our users customer support services. We may share personal data such as the communication content, IP address, e-mail address, and username (“Correspondence Data”) with these partners. The Correspondence Data may be processed by SPIL and business partners for the purpose of communication with you, blocking users, changing email addresses, reactivating or blocking accounts, adding or removing in-game items and other customer support services. The legal basis for the processing of the Correspondence Data is legitimate interest or consent depending on the service provided.

2.9 Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can (re)set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. You can opt out of receiving cookies from certain third-party advertising networks by resetting your browser. You may also use the following link to the Network Advertising Initiatives cookies [opt-out pag](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) or the link to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) [opt-out page](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/). However, some features and services may not function properly if cookies are disabled.

2.10 You may choose to register with us for a better game experience and/or to create a public or private profile for participating in our social gaming network. This includes, for example: overviews of high scores, achievements listings and individual game recommendations on the Websites. When you register with us, you may provide us with certain personal data such as a username, gender, date of birth and your email address (“Account Data”). The Account Data you provide us will be used for the purposes of providing our services, improving our Websites, maintaining back-ups and communicating with you. The legal basis for this processing is consent.

The information you disclose in that respect may also become publicly accessible if you choose this privacy setting. We provide you with privacy settings that restrict other users from accessing your information; namely, our network architecture and your privacy settings allow you to make informed choices about who has access to your information. We allow you to choose the information you provide to friends and networks through our Websites. When your privacy settings permit it, other users may be able to see and supplement your profile (e.g., by posting comments).
