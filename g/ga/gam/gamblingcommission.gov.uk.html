<h1>Privacy and cookies</h1>

<h2>Privacy statement</h2>
<p>This website is operated by the Gambling Commission whose principal place of business is&nbsp;Victoria Square House, Victoria Square, Birmingham B2 4BP.</p>
<p>We respect the privacy of every individual who visits our website. Our website does not automatically store or capture personal information, but merely logs the user's IP address which is automatically recognised by the web server.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In order to carry out our regulatory functions and meet our legal responsibilities, we need to use personal data that we collect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes we may need to ask other agencies or organisations for relevant information about you in order to carry those functions, for example, when considering the suitability of an applicant, we may seek evidence or opinions from other sources where that is appropriate or where our initial review has highlighted areas of concern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a duty to, amongst other things:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>keep sufficient information to provide services and fulfil our legal responsibilities</li>
<li>keep your records secure and accurate</li>
<li>only keep your information as long as is required.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Things you can do to help us:&nbsp;</p>

<li>allow us to share as much information about you as we need to.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is personal data?<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Under the DPA, personal data is defined as data that identifies a living person and includes any expression of opinion about that person. Personal data includes basic details such as name, address, telephone number, and date of birth, or notes and comments made about a person.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3>Sensitive personal data&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<li>religious beliefs</li>
<li>physical or mental health or condition</li>
<li>sexual orientation</li>
<li>criminal offences, including alleged offences.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Consent must usually be provided for us to use sensitive personal data. Where we are asking you for sensitive personal data, we will always try and tell you why and how the information will be used.&nbsp; There may be exceptions to this, for example when criminal investigations are ongoing and could be jeopardised.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What personal information do we hold?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In order to operate efficiently and carry out our statutory functions we collect and use information relating to individuals. This personal information includes information about the people that we license or provide services to, people that we are investigating, people we work with and employees past and present.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How long do we keep your information?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In some instances the law sets the length of time information has to be kept. Where this is not the case; we will use our discretion to make sure that we do not keep records for longer than we need to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will always try and keep your personal information secure, whether it is held on paper or electronically.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How we use your personal information<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We may use the information you provide for the following purposes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>dealing with enquiries and complaints&nbsp;</li>
<li>regulatory, licensing and enforcement functions</li>
<li>processing fee payments.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Sharing personal data&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Your data may also be shared with third parties who fulfil a service on our&nbsp;behalf, and under our express instructions. &nbsp;It may also be shared with other bodies where it is necessary to do so and where we are legally required or permitted to do so.&nbsp;This may include relevant public authorities, overseas regulators and law enforcement agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sharing data is primarily for the purpose of performing our regulatory functions such as assessing individuals’ suitability to be licensed but it may be also be necessary to share information for other reasons, such as the prevention and detection of crime or for the collection of tax and gaming duty. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Your rights</h3>
<p>Any person about whom we hold information has rights under the Data Protection Act. You may:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li>stop processing likely to cause substantial damage or substantial distress</li>
<li>receive compensation if you suffer damage as a consequence of wrongdoing by us</li>
<li>appeal to the ICO where you believe we&nbsp;have not complied with the Data Protection Act.</li>

<h3>Accessing your personal data</h3>
<p>If you&nbsp;wish to view your personal information we hold you can&nbsp;make a subject access request. This must be in writing. You can submit your request by post&nbsp;or by email to <a class="sys_16" href="mailto:info@gamblingcommission.gov.uk">info@gamblingcommission.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>What are cookies?</h3>
<p>When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>
<p>These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task</li>
<li>recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested</li>
<li>measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can manage these small files yourself and learn more about them through <a title="Internet browser cookies - what they are and how to manage them" class="sys_16" onclick="void(window.open('http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/SiteInformation/DG_197506?CID=Central&amp;PLA=url_mon&amp;CRE=managing_cookies',''));return false;" onkeypress="void(window.open('http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/SiteInformation/DG_197506?CID=Central&amp;PLA=url_mon&amp;CRE=managing_cookies',''));return false;" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/SiteInformation/DG_197506?CID=Central&amp;PLA=url_mon&amp;CRE=managing_cookies">internet browser cookies - what they are and how to manage them</a>.</p>
