         <p align="justify" class="copy"><strong>Gamevance – Privacy Policy</strong></p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy">Gamevance makes this Website (the
           "Site") available to registered members of
           the Site ("Members"), subject to this privacy
           policy (the "Policy") and the Gamevance
           Terms and Conditions ("Member Agreement").
           This Policy explains what information Gamevance
           collects about Members on the Site, how Gamevance
           uses and maintains the information. By becoming a Member
           of Gamevance and using the Site, you signify your
           acceptance of this Policy. If you do not agree to the
           terms of this Policy, in whole or part, you should not
           use this Site or become a Member. If you are a Member
           and do not agree with the terms of this Policy, you
           must immediately terminate your account. </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy">The Policy applies only to information
           collected on the Site and not to information collected
           or obtained from other sources. </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy">Collection of Personally Identifiable
           Information <br>
           Gamevance collects personally identifiable information
           ("PII") from Members that is volunteered by
           Members during the registration process or in response
           to specific information requests. Gamevance also
           collects PII which third parties provide to Gamevance
           in accordance with their respective privacy policies.
           Examples of PII that may be requested and/or collected
           include: first and last name, address, e-mail address,
           and telephone number. In order to allow Gamevance
           to comply with applicable legal reporting requirements,
           Members who win certain prizes on the Site may be requested
           to provide their information and agree to have their
           name and likeness, such as a photograph, published for
           marketing purposes. All prize winners must comply with
           any sweepstakes or contest rules that are published
           and relevant to the particular event where a prize has
           been awarded. Gamevance never shares social security
           numbers to any third party, unless required by law for
           tax and reporting purposes. From time to time, Gamevance may also present opportunities for Members
           to voluntarily provide a limited amount of general demographic
           information about themselves, which may include their
           gender, birth date, marital status, education, occupation,
           and household income. </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy"><strong>Use and Sharing of Personally
           Identifiable Information </strong><br>
           Gamevance reserves the right to use PII: (1) for
           the specific purpose for which such information was
           provided; (2) as disclosed at the time such information
           is provided; or (3) as disclosed in this Policy. However,
           please note that Gamevance Inc. may change this
           Policy at any time (See "Changes to this Policy,"
           below), and that therefore Gamevance may in the
           future use PII for additional purposes not currently
           included in this Policy. Please check this Policy frequently
           so you can view the current Policy. </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy">When you register to become a Member,
           you are automatically registered to become a Member
           of all other online properties in the Gamevance
           network (collectively, the "Network Sites").
           Accordingly, Gamevance may share PII with the
           Network Sites. </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy">Gamevance may share PII (except
           for credit card information and social security number)
           with its partners, sponsors, advertisers, independent
           contractors, service providers and marketers, lookup
           and reference services, and any other entities that
           Gamevance believes are able to provide Members
           with special offers and opportunities. Note that although
           Gamevance advises everyone who receives PII from
           Gamevance to support this Policy, Gamevance
           has no control over such party's information handling
           practices and is not responsible for any failure of
           such party to adhere to this Policy. As provided in
           the Member Agreement, Members are required to provide
           their PII to Gamevance as a condition of Membership,
           and to understand and agree that Gamevance may
           share their PII with the Network Sites and unaffiliated
           third parties. If you do not provide the required PII
           or do not agree that Gamevance may share your
           PII with such entities, you may not register as a Member,
           and if you are already a Member, you must immediately
           terminate your account, by following the instructions
           in the "Terminate Account" section below.
           Additionally, Gamevance may share Member PII in
           aggregate, non-personal form, with select companies
           that wish to reach a particular Member target audience.
           This information will allow these entities to provide
           relevant offers to a specific group of Members. Finally,
           Gamevance may disclose PII in order to: (1) comply
           with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries;
           (3) comply with valid legal process and research or
           prepare for litigation or threat of litigation; and
           (4) protect the rights or property of Gamevance,
           the Network Sites or other Members and users of the
           Site. </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy"><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information
           </strong><br>
           Gamevance also collects certain non-personally
           identifiable information, including the non-personally
           identifiable information more fully described below.
         </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy">Cookies. Gamevance uses "cookies"
           on the Site. Cookies are small pieces of information
           that Gamevance's server places on an individual's
           computer hard drive to enable the individual to more
           easily communicate and interact with the Site and Gamevance e-mails. For example, Gamevance will
           place a cookie on a Member's computer when he/she initially
           registers with the Site. The next time that Member visits
           the Site, Gamevance's server will recognize the
           cookie (and the Member) and allow the Member to play
           the game immediately without signing in. While some
           Web browsers allow a Member to automatically reject
           all cookies or be notified when a cookie is about to
           be placed on the Member's computer, disabling this feature
           may compromise the efficiency and added services that
           cookies provide. </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy">IP Address. Gamevance collects your
           IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems
           with Gamevance's server, and to administer this
           Site. An IP address is a number that is assigned to
           your computer when you use the Internet. Your IP address
           is also used to help identify you during a particular
           session and to gather broad demographic data. </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy">Clear GIFs. Gamevance uses a common
           technology known as a "Clear GIF" or "1-by-1
           Pixel" on the Site and in e-mail communications
           with Members. A Clear GIF, or "graphic interface
           format" is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1x1
           pixel) that Gamevance (or a partner of Gamevance) places on the Site or in an e-mail. GIFs,
           which do not contain any PII, provide Gamevance
           with important information about how Members use the
           Site and respond to e-mail messages. With this information,
           Gamevance is better able to track the performance
           of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness
           of particular creative e-mail presentations. Gamevance may also allow its advertisers and promotional
           partners the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely
           to track Members who link from their respective sites
           to this Site, but this ability to track such activity
           does not allow these entities access to Member PII.
           Although the information collected through the foregoing
           methods does not itself contain any PII, Gamevance
           may analyze and match such information with other information
           that you provide (including PII) as well as information
           that Gamevance may obtain elsewhere, and Gamevance may share all or some of such information with
           partners, prospective partners, and other affiliated
           or unaffiliated third parties. Gamevance may also
           disclose any of the non-personally identifiable information
           described above in order to (1) comply with applicable
           laws, (2) respond to governmental inquiries, (3) comply
           with valid legal process, or (4) protect the rights
           or property of Gamevance or its Members and users
           of the Site </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy"><strong>Linking of Information </strong><br>
           Gamevance may combine information provided by
           a Member with information obtained from other sources.
           Enhancing Member files with this other information will
           allow Gamevance to provide Members with more relevant
           services email promotional offers, and direct mail pieces.
           For example, a Member's user profile will automatically
           be updated with any information that user enters on
           any of the Network Sites. Likewise, any information
           provided to Gamevance will be used to update the
           Member's profile on the Network Sites. </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy"><strong>Opt-Out of Gamevance E-mails</strong>
           <br>
           When you become a Member, you will automatically be
           registered to receive promotional offers and updates,
           via email from Gamevance, from the Network Sites
           and other associated email brands. Additionally, when
           you register to become a Member on the Site, you will
           be provided with the opportunity to receive promotional
           offers via e-mail, from partners of Gamevance
           While some of these opportunities will only be sent
           to you if you expressly request them, others may be
           sent to you unless you elect not to receive them. Accordingly,
           when you register, please review these offers carefully.
           Members may, at any time, choose not to receive promotional
           e-mails from Gamevance, the Network Sites or partners
           of Gamevance by following the "unsubscribe"
           instructions in any e-mail, or terminating their Gamevance account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Gamevance may at any time contact Members for the purpose
           of communicating important information about Gamevance to Members. Note that unsubscribing from one
           e-mail list does not automatically unsubscribe you from
           any other e-mail list that you may be on. Please read
           the e-mail carefully to find out which list you are
           unsubscribing from. If you would like to unsubscribe
           from all e-mail lists, you must terminate your account.
           In addition, if we have shared your information with
           one of our partners, unsubscribing from our list will
           not prevent these third parties from emailing you. </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy"><strong>Third Party Services </strong><br>
           Certain activities, information and services available
           to Members are provided by entities not affiliated with
           Gamevance. For example, if you choose to purchase
           a product or service or play a game from the site, the
           information you provide in connection with such purchase
           or game play may be made available to a third party
           to satisfy that purpose. Although Gamevance advises
           all of its partners to support this Policy, Gamevance
           has no control over their information handling practices
           and is not responsible for any failure of such partners
           to adhere to this Policy. </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy"><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong> <br>
           In the course of serving advertisements to this Site,
           third-party advertisers or ad servers may place or recognize
           a unique cookie on your browser. The use of cookies
           by such third party advertisers or ad servers is not
           subject to this Policy, but is subject to their own
           respective privacy policies. </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy"><strong>Links from the Site </strong><br>
           Gamevance provides links to many of Gamevance's
           advertiser and partner Web sites. If you link to any
           of these third party Web sites, this Policy will not
           apply to your use of, and activities on, those sites.
           We encourage you to read the legal notices posted on
           these sites, including their privacy policies. Gamevance shall have no responsibility or liability for
           your visitation to, and the data collection and use
           practices of, these sites. </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy">International Law. Should any law present
           in the nation where you reside or conduct business be
           such that any product, service, or activity conducted
           by, on, or via our site is banned, regulated, controlled
           or illegal then you are asked not to participate in
           any service, product or activity offered by, on or via
           this site. </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy"><strong>Note Concerning Users Under 18
           Years of Age </strong><br>
           Unless otherwise noted, the Site, the Gamevance
           e-mails and the content available in connection therewith,
           are neither intended for, nor directed to, persons under
           the age of 14. Except as otherwise noted, if Gamevance learns that a person who registers on the Site
           is under the age of 14, Gamevance will promptly
           terminate that individual's membership. </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy"><strong>Children's Privacy </strong><br>
           This Site is not open to children. Accordingly, we do
           not intend to collect personally identifiable information
           from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age. </p>
         <p align="justify" class="copy"><strong>Security </strong><br>
