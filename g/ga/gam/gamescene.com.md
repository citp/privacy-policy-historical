To do this, you must provide an email address. This is used to email a password to you. it is also used to verify that you have not signed up for a reserved name before -- we want there to be only one reserved name per person.

Recommend to a Friend: When you use the "Recommend this game to a friend" feature on one of our sites, your email address is required so that it can be attached to the email, just like it would be if you were sending an email using client software.
