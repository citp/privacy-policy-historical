the Website and when you use the Service. It is important that visitors are
fully informed about the use of their personal information. GameFiesta TM believes
in 100% permission-based marketing. For each visitor to our Website, our web

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt">To complete the
purchase or download of a gaming title at the Website (each, a
"Game"), we gather personal information from you in order to
establish your GameFiestaTM membership, such as your first and last name,
e-mail address, telephone number and other demographic information. In order to
purchase a Game, you must supply additional information, such as you billing

necessary for us to complete your purchase. In addition, we may collect

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt">The information that
you submit to GameFiestaTM remains your property, but by submitting the
information to GameFiestaTM you grant us the right to use such information for
marketing purposes including, but not limited to, sharing such information with
third parties. GameFiestaTM may also use such information to directly market
certain offers to you including, without limitation, via e-mail marketing,
telemarketing, direct mail and text messaging, to monitor compliance with our
Terms and Conditions and for content improvement and feedback purposes. We may
sell the personal information that you supply to us and we may join together
with other businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our customers.
These businesses may include, but are not limited to: (a) providers of online,
e-mail and direct mail marketing services and applications including, without
limitation, lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation;
and (b) providers of telemarketing services. <br><br><b>If you are a California state resident</b> you may opt-out from
having your personal information transferred to third parties for use is such
third parties' direct marketing efforts by clicking <a href="globalOptOut.html">here</a>
and completing an opt-out request or by sending a written e-mail request to <a href="mailto:CAoptout@traffixinc.com">CAoptout@traffixinc.com</a>. However,
where California residents opt-out from permitting their personal information
to be shared, such individuals may still receive selected offers directly from GameFiestaTM,
in accordance with the law. In addition, GameFiestaTM reserves the right to release customer information: (a)
in the event that we believe that the Website is being or has been used in
violation of the Terms and Conditions or to commit unlawful acts; (b) if the
information is subpoenaed; or (c) if GameFiestaTM is sold or acquired.
Moreover, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to
any third party when GameFiestaTM, in its sole discretion, determines the
disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail
address with other third parties for suppression purposes in compliance with
the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt">In addition, by
downloading a Game or as a paying customer of GameFiestaTM, you agree that such
act constitutes a purchase, inquiry and/or application for purposes of the
Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR ?310 et seq. (the "Rule"). Notwithstanding
that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's
Do-Not-Call List, GameFiestaTM retains the right to contact you via
telemarketing in accordance with the Rule. Moreover, by registering with, or
requesting information from, a third-party advertiser at or through the
Website, such action shall constitute an inquiry and/or application with the
respective third-party advertiser for purposes of the Rule and you may be
contacted via e-mail, direct mail and/or telemarketing by such third-party
advertiser in accordance with the Rule. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt">To the extent that
customer credit card-specific information and/or social security number is
collected by GameFiestaTM and any of its affiliates and/or subsidiaries, said
information will be kept in confidence and will not be shared with any third
parties (other than consumer credit agencies) without your prior informed
consent, except to charge you for Games purchased at the Website. In addition,
by submitting your credit card information to us, you authorize GameFiestaTM to
periodically verify that your credit card account continues to be a valid and
active one by various methods including, without limitation, charging and,
thereafter immediately crediting, a small sum to the card. Such verification
may be conducted through a third party and, in that case, GameFiestaTM will
share your specific credit card information with this third party for
verification purposes. Apart from the foregoing uses, GameFiestaTM and its
affiliates and/or subsidiaries reserve the right to share with third parties
the fact that they have credit card information on file for specific customers
but they will not share the specific credit card information with third parties
without the customer's prior authorization. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

customers' (collectively, "Users") server, IP address and
browser-type related information in the general administration of our Website.
GameFiestaTM reserves the right to transfer and/or sell aggregate or group data
about GameFiestaTM Users for lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data is data
that describes the demographics, usage or other characteristics of GameFiestaTM
Users as a group without disclosing personally identifiable information. By
submitting your personal information to, and/or using, the Website, you agree
to allow GameFiestaTM to transfer and/or sell such aggregate data to third
parties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt">LINKS:</span></strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt"> This Website may contain
links to other websites. Please be aware that GameFiestaTM is not responsible
for the privacy practices of other third party websites. We encourage visitors
to be aware when they leave our Website and to read the privacy policies of
each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This
Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by this Website. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt">USE OF
COOKIES:</span></strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt">
A cookie is a piece of data stored on a customer or visitor's hard drive
containing information about the respective customer or visitor. Cookies can
provide great convenience for our Users. For instance, by setting a cookie on
our Website, a customer would not have to log in a password more than once,
thereby saving time while on our Website. Even your payment information can be
kept on file and thereafter used to facilitate additional Game purchases at the
Website. However, even in the case where an existing customer rejects a cookie,
he/she may still use our Website. The only drawback to this is that the
customer will be limited in what he/she can access in some areas on our
Website, much like visitor-level access. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt">We occasionally use
cookies and pixel gifs to track and target the interests of our Users to
enhance the experience on our Website and/or for advertising tracking purposes.

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt">GameFiestaTM takes
every precaution to protect our customers' information. When a customer submits
sensitive personal and payment information via the Website, the information is
protected both online and off-line. When our registration, download or purchase
process prompts a customer to enter sensitive information (such as a credit
card or social security number), the information is encrypted and is protected
with industry-standard encryption - SSL technology. While we use SSL encryption
to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to
protect customer information off-line. Access to customer information is
restricted in our offices and areas where such information is stored. Only
employees who need access to the information to perform a specific job are
granted access to personally identifiable information. If you have any
questions about the security at our Website, please contact us. <a href="mailto:security@traffixinc.com">security@traffixinc.com</a>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:1.0pt">Customers who no
longer wish to receive a newsletter or other promotional materials from us or
our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the

Act. The Website is for use by individuals 18 years of age or older.

at any time. All Privacy Policy changes will take effect immediately upon their
