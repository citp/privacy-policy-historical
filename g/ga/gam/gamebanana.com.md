Cookies can neither damage user files nor read information from users' hard drives. Company combines all usage information provided by such Cookies, and Company does not monitor your use of the Website. Allowing Company to create a Cookie on your hard drive will not give Company or any other site access to the rest of your computer's hard drive, and only Company will be able to read the Cookie that the Website creates.
