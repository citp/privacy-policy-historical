Moreover, by registering with, or requesting information from, a third-party advertiser at or through the Website, such action shall constitute an inquiry and/or application with the respective third-party advertiser for purposes of the Rule and you may be contacted via e-mail, direct mail and/or telemarketing by such third-party advertiser in accordance with the Rule. 

To the extent that customer credit card-specific information and/or social security number is collected by GameFiestaTM and any of its affiliates and/or subsidiaries, said information will be kept in confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other than consumer credit agencies) without your prior informed consent, except to charge you for Games purchased at the Website. In addition, by submitting your credit card information to us, you authorize GameFiestaTM to periodically verify that your credit card account continues to be a valid and active one by various methods including, without limitation, charging and, thereafter immediately crediting, a small sum to the card. Such verification may be conducted through a third party and, in that case, GameFiestaTM will share your specific credit card information with this third party for verification purposes. Apart from the foregoing uses, GameFiestaTM and its affiliates and/or subsidiaries reserve the right to share with third parties the fact that they have credit card information on file for specific customers but they will not share the specific credit card information with third parties without the customer's prior authorization.

**USE OF COOKIES:** A cookie is a piece of data stored on a customer or visitor's hard drive containing information about the respective customer or visitor.

When our registration, download or purchase process prompts a customer to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card or social security number), the information is encrypted and is protected with industry-standard encryption - SSL technology. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect customer information off-line. Access to customer information is restricted in our offices and areas where such information is stored. Only employees who need access to the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. If you have any questions about the security at our Website, please contact us. [security@traffixinc.com](mailto:security@traffixinc.com).
