# GameShadow - Get The Latest Demo, Trailer, Video, Patch, Free Game

GameShadow is fully committed to respecting your privacy and to protecting any information you provide to it. We treat both privacy and security as a priority and make every effort to ensure that all the information provided by you is protected. This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") respects and protects the privacy of all visitors to GameShadow and intends to give you as much information and control as possible.

The Policy explains how GameShadow collects and uses information. We hope that our candour will remove any concerns you may have and will make visiting GameShadow a rewarding experience.

Although we endeavour to keep you up-to-date on all changes made to the website, this Policy may be amended from time to time without notice to you. It is your responsibility to read the Policy carefully and review any changes that may have been made. 

What information does GameShadow collect and how does GameShadow use this information?

## 1\. Personal Information

In order to join the GameShadow Community will need to create a profile and you need to register to use the software. When registering or creating the profile you will be asked to provide an email address and create a username and password to the personal details. If you choose to purchase music or other goods or service by clicking on a third party link (i.e. Amazon) provided on the website, we will not collect any personal information related to the transaction (i.e. credit card number, address, etc.). The only information that we will collect with respect to such third party links is (a) the number of generic GameShadow users who utilised such links and (b) the number of purchases made by these generic users.

## 2\. Your Game Data

From the moment you install our software we will begin to create and maintain the details of the games you own and trailers or demos you view. This is accomplished by monitoring your activity on the website and in the software (i.e. which games you own, which demos and trailers you view). In the future we may also monitor any reviews or feedback you give to features and reviews written by others.

GameShadow does not process any personally identifiable information related to your games and/or profile in any manner other than as described in the previous paragraph. We do not, for example, provide third parties with your name, location (if we know it), or a list of the games you own. However this data may be viewed by all other users of GameShadow (who may include other organisations or representatives of other organisations who have registered GameShadow users) and that they may easily associate this information with your GameShadow username. Please see the Statistical Information section below to learn more on this subject and to learn how we log and use information related to your record collection and/or profile in the aggregate.

## 3\. Location-based Information

We keep track of the domains from which people visit GameShadow, but we cannot see a user's zip code, post code, city or country unless the user chooses to explicitly provide this information to us.

## 4\. Browser Information

We collect data regarding the anonymous users of GameShadow, including: a. The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user's computer. This may or may not be associated with a particular Internet Service Provider (ISP).? b. The referring URL, if any.? c. The browser software identification (i.e. the brand and version of your browser software).

## 5\. Statistical Information

As discussed above, we log (but do not use) personally identifiable information with respect to the games you own and the game related activities you make on the site (such as downloading demos, patches, trailers etc). For example, we know the games you have loaded on your PC, which games you have added to your ‘most wanted’ list, and the demos trailers etc you have viewed. We do not use this information in any manner in conjunction with your personal information (i.e. although we here at GameShadow can connect your username to your email address, we don't use a personally identifiable activity log in any manner whatsoever and no third parties are given access to it). Please note, however, that this information may be viewed by all other users (who may include other organisations or representatives of other organisations who have registered as GameShadow users) in conjunction with your GameShadow username. Thus, with respect to other users, we don't view this information as personally identifiable because of the veil of anonymity afforded by your username. If you take any action which destroys the anonymity of your username, we cannot be held responsible for the fact that others may as a result be able to personally identify you with your username (and therefore with your games information and GameShadow profile). If you realise that you have taken action which has destroyed or may destroy the anonymity of your username, please notify us and we will issue you either a new username and/or password. 

Please note that we do log and use statistical information in the aggregate. For example, we know the number of users who own a game or view a particular trailer. From this information we are able to compile statistics in the form of percentages of all users (i.e. 29% of our users own game XYZ). We can of course compare the ownership of one game to those of another. We are also able to perform more sophisticated statistical operations based on the information collected. For example, we can know the raw number (and associated percentages) of users who own one particular game that also own another game in the same or another genre. From this information we are able to determine which games are "related" in terms of overall ownership and we can see which genres of games or family of products tend to be related. As a service, we may supply certain aggregate statistical information to game developers and publishers in order to help them understand the likes and dislikes of the game owners.

## 6\. Data Feeds/Messaging/Scrawler/Nudges and Communications With Other Users

We currently offer functionality that enables community members to communicate with each other and automatically see details on their Friends, Groups and Games. In the future we may offer other interactive features such as instant messaging and chat. Please note that all personal information you display, communicate using such functionality and the automatic ‘What you have been doing’ feed becomes public information and we are not responsible for any information you choose to make public or is automatically generated by your activities. Whilst we do not currently monitor this we may in the future monitor such traffic via electronic software or otherwise in order to check for obscenity, defamation or abusive language, which we reserve the right to remove at any time. In addition, if you choose to personally communicate or meet with any other GameShadow user by exchanging postal/email addresses, telephone numbers or otherwise via the interactive functionality of GameShadow, you do so at your own risk. GameShadow cannot be held responsible for any consequences which flow from your decision to communicate or interact with other GameShadow users in places or under circumstances which we do not control. We advise you to use extreme caution whenever you socialise or interact with people whom you have met via the internet.

## 7\. Software Updates

In order to ensure that GameShadow is functioning at its best, from time to time we may ask you to upgrade to a newer version of our software. In addition, we may find it necessary to send you automatic fixes or support files. If we make a modification that materially affects your privacy, we will endeavour to notify you of such modification and we will update the Policy accordingly. 

## 8\. Links

We may display links to third party sites, however we cannot control and cannot be held responsible for those other sites, their privacy policies or how they treat information about their users. We advise you to check their privacy policies to find out how they are treating your personal information. 

## 9\. Data Protection

GameShadow complies with the Data Protection Act 1998, including all UK amending legislation and EU directives. Pursuant to the Act, you have the right to be informed of and to have access to all of the personally identifiable information we hold about you.

## 10\. GameShadow Software

If you choose to download the GameShadow software, it will monitor all the games you have installed on your computer (even if you are not online). This information will then be integrated into your GameShadow Community profile. (Downloader IP action here) The GameShadow software cannot and will not collect and transfer any other information from your computer other than as described in the EULA. For the avoidance of doubt, however, please be advised that GameShadow cannot be held liable for any damage which may occur to your computer as a result of downloading the GameShadow software, nor shall it be liable for any invasion of privacy related to the same. 

## 11\. Does GameShadow Use Cookies?

We use cookies to help you use GameShadow but do not use cookies to capture personally identifiable information. Currently, we only use “session” cookies, which means that they only last for as long as you are online. We use these cookies to identify you as a valid user, to ensure that no one else can simultaneously log in and use your profile and to help personalise your GameShadow experience in conjunction with your profile. In the future we may decide to employ "persistent" cookies which stay on your computer after you have gone offline. In the event that we introduce “persistent” cookies we will update this Policy accordingly so that you are made aware of such a change. Most browsers have cookies turned on as a default, but you can always disable cookies via your browser preferences. If you choose to disable cookies, however, you won't be able enjoy a significant proportion of GameShadow’s functionality. Please remember that cookies cannot read your hard drive or give any information collected to any third party. A cookie can only be read by the organisation that sets it.

## 12\. Security

GameShadow endeavours to protect the security of your information as much as we endeavour to protect our own information and network. We employ firewalls and store all of our files and information on secure terminals. In addition, all user passwords are protected by encryption technology. 

## 13\. GameShadow Policy for Young People

We realise and understand that many young people love computer games and will therefore visit GameShadow, however we encourage all persons under 16 to consult with their parents before submitting any information to the GameShadow Community website and indeed any other website. However the GameShadow Software does require a separate registration in order to use the enhanced features such as receiving newsletters, customizing your profile and remote downloading. Having said this, we believe that ultimately it is the responsibility of parents to supervise children when online and we therefore recommend that parental control tools be put in place. 

## 14\. Disclaimer

We believe in privacy and therefore will take all reasonable measures to ensure that your personally identifiable information remains private. However, in the event that we are forced to disclose personally identifiable information by law (i.e. by court order), we will make such a disclosure without being in violation of this Policy. 

## 15\. Business Transitions

If GameShadow is acquired by another company or sells a portion of its assets to another company, it is likely that user information will be a part of the assets transferred. If as a result of such a business transition information is to be collected, used or disclosed in a manner or for a purpose different from that stated above, GameShadow will endeavour to notify all users of such changes. 

## 16\. Consent

By disclosing any information to GameShadow through the website you consent to the collection, storage and use of such information by GameShadow as set out in this Policy and the Terms and Conditions. If GameShadow makes any changes to this Policy these changes will be detailed on this page in order to ensure that you are fully aware of what information is collected, how it is used and under what circumstances it will be disclosed. If you are concerned about how your information is collected, used or disclosed, you should periodically check back at this page. If you have any specific concerns not addressed in the Policy, please contact us using the feedback page on the website.
