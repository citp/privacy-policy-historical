## Google AdSense

This website uses Google AdSense, a service for integrating advertisements of Google Inc. (“Google”). Provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

Google AdSense uses so-called “cookies”, text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website. Google AdSense also uses so-called web beacons (invisible graphics). These web beacons can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on these pages.

The information generated by cookies and web beacons on the use of this website (including your IP address) and delivery of advertising formats are transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the USA. This information may be shared by Google with Google affiliates. However, Google will not merge your IP address with other data you have stored.

The storage of AdSense cookies is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize both its website and its advertising.

You can prevent the installation of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; however, please note that in this case you may not be able to use all features of this website to the fullest extent. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.

## Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, which are text files that are stored on your computer and enable analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie concerning your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the United States and stored there. If IP anonymisation is activated on this website, your IP address will, however, be truncated by Google beforehand within the area of the member states of the European Union or other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the United States and truncated there.

Google will use this information on behalf of this website’s owner to evaluate your use of the website, compile reports about website activities, and provide the website’s operator with further services related to website and Internet usage. The IP address sent by your browser as required by Google Analytics is not merged with other data by Google.

## Use of Facebook Social Plugins

This website uses so-called social plugins (“plugins”) from the social network Facebook, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). You can find an overview of Facebook plugins and their appearance at: <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins>.

If you access a page from our website that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook’s servers. Facebook sends the contents of the plugin directly to your browser and embeds them into the web page. This process enables Facebook to receive the information that your browser has accessed the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a Facebook account or are not logged in with Facebook at the time. This information (including your IP address) is sent by your browser directly to a Facebook server in the United States and is stored there.

If you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can then attribute the visit to our website directly to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins – for example, if you click on the ‘Like‘ button or submit a comment – the corresponding information will be sent directly to a Facebook server and stored there. The information will also be published on Facebook and shown to your Facebook friends.

Facebook may use this information for the purposes of advertising, market research and the personalized design of Facebook pages. To this end, Facebook creates usage, interest and relationship profiles, e.g. to analyse your use of our website with regard to the advertisements that Facebook displays to you, to inform other Facebook users about your activities on our web site, and to provide further services associated with the use of Facebook.

If you do not want Facebook to collect data about you via our website and to attribute this to your Facebook account, you should log out of your Facebook account before visiting our website.

The purpose and scope of data collection and ongoing processing and use of data by Facebook, as well as your rights and the setting options for protecting your privacy can be found in the Facebook privacy policy here: <https://www.facebook.com/policy.php>

## Conversion Measurement with Facebook’s Conversion Tracking Pixel

With your consent, we will use the conversion tracking pixel of Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, United States (hereinafter: “Facebook”) on our website. With the aid of this tool, we can track the actions of users after they have seen or clicked on a Facebook advertisement. This allows us to record the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes. The data collected in this manner is anonymous for us, which means we do not see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is saved and processed by Facebook. We are informing you of this process based on the current information available to us. Facebook can link this data with your Facebook account and use it for its own advertising purposes in accordance with Facebook’s data policy at <https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/>. This data can enable Facebook and its partners to insert advertisements on Facebook and outside Facebook. Furthermore, a cookie can be saved on your computer to this end.

## Further Information

Your trust is important to us. We are, therefore, always happy to discuss this policy with you and answer any questions you may have concerning the processing of your personal data. If you have any questions that this Privacy Policy was unable to answer, or if you wish to receive more information, please consult our data protection officer at any time:
