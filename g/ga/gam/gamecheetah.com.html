            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">An 
              IP address is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer 
              whenever you’re surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers 
              that "serve" up Web pages -- automatically identify your computer

              showing how and when guests use the site, cookies help us see which 
              areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates 
              to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and 
              pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies.

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> A 
              cookie lets the computers remember that you’ve registered, which 
              allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites. Similarly, 
              The WorldVillage Store Online uses a temporary cookie to track which 
              products you’ve chosen while shopping. The cookie expires once you’re 
              done shopping. Letting it do the record keeping saves you the trouble 
              of entering information over and over again during a single visit. 
              If you decline this cookie, you may have difficulty ordering your 
              selections. </font></p>
