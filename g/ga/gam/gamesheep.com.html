<strong>How we use cookies</strong><br>
A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.
<br><br>

We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about webpage traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.
<br><br>

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.
<br><br>

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.
<br><br>

<strong>Links to other websites</strong><br>
Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.

	<li>whenever you are asked to fill in a form on the website, look for the box that you can click to indicate that you do not want the information to be used by anybody for direct marketing purposes</li>
	<li>if you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by writing to or emailing us at office@GameSheep.com</li>
</ul>
<br><br>

We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. We may use your personal information to send you promotional information about third parties which we think you may find interesting if you tell us that you wish this to happen.
<br><br>

<strong>Newsletters</strong><br>
GameSheep.com uses email as the main method of contact with its users. When signing up to become a member of GameSheep.com, the user must agree to accept and cannot unsubscribe from non-promotional emails (e.g. emails containing invoices, support correspondence and subscription information).<br>
<br>
These emails are transactional emails and usually occur each time an action is triggered on the site:<br>
<br>
- registration<br>
- password change<br>

- password reminder<br>
- internal messages from other users<br>
<br> 
GameSheep.com also sends newsletters, periodically. Subscribing to the newsletters is optional and free for all users. GameSheep.com newsletters contain new site games and top members. Occasionally GameSheep.com sends promotional newsletters on behalf of our customers. Your personal information is NOT shared to any third party without your prior consent.<br>
<br> 
Additional information collected for each sent newsletter is:<br>
<br> 
- number of newsletter opens<br>
- number of clicks on each link inside a newsletter<br>

<br><br>

<strong>Subscribe / Unsubscribe methodology for GameSheep.com promotional newsletters</strong><br>
Each newsletter subscription needs to be confirmed. The confirmation (double opt in) is done by sending an initial greeting email, where a user action is needed to confirm the subscription, by clicking the unique personalized confirmation link. This way we ensure that the user agrees upon joining the newsletter list, and that the email addresses are real.<br>
<br> 
Each newsletter received has clear information about the sender and unsubscribe methods. The unsubscribe is fulfilled within seconds after clicking the unsubscribe link and no further newsletters will be sent to the users who have stated that they do not wish to receive the specified information, unless they choose to register to the newsletter again.<br> 
<br><br>
<strong>Policy Modifications</strong><br>
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when GameSheep.com makes changes to this privacy statement, we will highlight the changes on our homepage and email users who have given us permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent.
