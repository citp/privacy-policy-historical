<br><br>
We may use your personal information to provide analyses of our users in the aggregate to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. We may also disclose and otherwise use, on an anonymous basis, affiliation, position, interests and other non-personal information about customers.
<br><br>
In addition, we will share the personal information we collect from you under the following circumstances:
<br><br>

<br><br>
Additionally, this Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of third party websites linked to the Site(s).

You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites or contact the respective webmasters of those websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies.
<br><br>

<br><br>
