**_Your Data is Important_ **: It is important to note that, as an eCommerce site, we do collect, use and store data in order to deliver the goods and services you request from us. While we are required to share some data with vendors in order to process credit cards, deliver packages and stream video, we DO NOT resell any data to third parties FOR ANY REASON. Specifically, we DO NOT resell or make available your personal data so that others can sell you stuff you don't want. We are in the business of delivering the best possible customer experience we can and we use information to help us accomplish this goal. The European Union, to grant people greater visibility into and control over how their data is used, passed legislation that requires companies to gain the active consent from users to collect, use and store data. To comply with this legislation (known as GDPR), we are making a variety of updates to our policies and processes, but there is no change in our fundamental approach to how we use your personal data: **we only use your data to help you find relevant products and to deliver your products.**

**_Language is Important_ **: This Website and its related Terms of Use and Privacy Policy are provided only in the English language and are intended for use by those who are proficient in the English language. If you do not believe your level of English is sufficient to fully understand our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy then as much as we would otherwise love to have you as a customer, we ask that you do not use our Website.

### Data Retention Policy

There are two main categories of data we are primarily concerned with: Personal Data (all of the information that identifies a particular customer (e.g. name, address, email address, etc.) and Sales Data (the purchases any customer may make). We undertake that we will not retain your personal data for periods that are longer than necessary for the purpose for which it was obtained and/or held for processing. We must, however, retain sales data for a minimum of seven years in order to comply with the requirements of various legal and financial regulatory agencies. As a result, in addition to a user's ability to export/modify/purge personal data from our system, we have a two-tiered approach to purging personal and sales data. 

Generally speaking, we will retain your personal data for a minimum period of three (3) years following the last day in which you interacted with us regarding the purpose for which the personal data was obtained and processed. For example, we will retain Sales Data related to any sale for a minimum of three (3) years from the date the relevant goods or services were delivered to or, in the case of streaming video, used by you.

In some cases it is not possible for us to specify in advance the periods for which your personal data will be retained. In such cases, we undertake to determine a period of retention based upon the relevant applicable statute of limitations as concerns any claim you may have as against each other based upon your interaction with the Website and/or the order or delivery of any goods or services and to attend to security issues and prevent or investigate attacks and/or fraud, maintain our record keeping, and properly administer our Website and business. 

In any event, we may retain your personal data where retention is necessary for legal or regulatory compliance purposes or in order to protect the vital interests of either of us or of a third party.

It is important to note that once personal data is purged either by request or our data retention policy, there will be no way for the customer or our customer service department to access any of the data or digital products stored on our servers and associated with that account.

### Special Rights For European Residents.

If you reside in the European Union you may have additional rights as set forth under the GDPR. The GDPR is a complex regulatory scheme and we have not provided an exhaustive summary in this Policy. We advise you to read the relevant regulation and guidance provided by the relevant regulatory authorities for a full explanation of your rights.

Your principal rights under the GDPR are access, rectification, erasure, processing restriction or objection, portability, withdrawal of consent and the right to complaint to a regulatory authority. These rights are not absolute and exceptions apply. For example, we may not accommodate a request to delete or change information if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override your interests or the change would violate any law or regulation or if retention is necessary to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information, comply with a legal obligation, attend to security issues and prevent or investigate attacks and/or fraud, maintain our record keeping, and properly administer our Website and business, to protect the vital interests of you, us, or any third party, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

If the legal basis for our processing your personal data is your consent, or the necessity to comply with your requests, or for the performance of a contract we have with you, and we are automatically processing your personal data, you have the right to receive from us a copy of such personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. 

To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time subject to applicable exceptions. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.

If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection.
