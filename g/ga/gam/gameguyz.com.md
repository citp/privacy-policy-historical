**Privacy Policy for gameguyz**

 Gameguyz is promise to protecting your privacy. You accept this policy and agree with it when you sign up to be an on-line visitor of our website. We have adopted a companywide On-Line Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us.

## What information we collect and why we collect it?

We collect the information on a voluntary condition and in order to provide all of our users with better services.

We gather personal information from all registering members. This includes e-mail address, and age. We also store your personal preferences related to this Web site in your account data.

We also collect data relating to all network connections, primarily your IP address. We use this information to track fraudulent user activity (including but not limited to: the use of multiple accounts, account sharing, illegal forum activity.) Your browser type and version are also detected to better enhance your user experience.

We keep track of what polls you have voted in to prevent duplicate voting. This data is stored with your user account data.

Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information through our messaging system, public forms, or chat rooms - this information could be collected and used by other parties.

We encourage you to review the privacy statements of Web sites that you choose to link to from GAMEGUYZ.COM so that you know how those web sites collect and use your personal information.

## How do we use your personal information?

Your date of membership and last login date is used in your GAMEGUYZ.COM "User Profile" to create a better sense of community at our site. In addition we give you the option of displaying your e-mail address and age. If you wish to hide this data, you can do so in the "Your Account Settings" page.

NOTE: any of your personal information will never be sold or shared with other parties by GAMEGUYZ.COM. All information is strictly for internal use and all e-mails are only sent from our facilities.

You can change your subscription to our website by updating your account profile by selecting "Your Account Settings" and then modifying the options in "Alert Settings".

GAMEGUYZ.COM may access and/or disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on our company or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of our company, including the GAMEGUYZ.COM Web site; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of GAMEGUYZ.COM, its web sites, or the public.

**How do we use your content?**

We provide you with some services that allow you to submit content. You will own the intellectual property rights of the content. That is to say, what belongs to you stays yours. We will also provide you some services to access and remove content. In some of our services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those services. Please make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us the license for any content you submit to our Services.

You can find more details about how Gameguyz uses and stores content in the privacy policy or additional terms for particular services. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.

## How do we use the cookies?

When you access our website, small data files called "cookies" may be placed on your computer by us, or companies we hire to track how our website is used.

We send a "session cookie" to your computer when you log in to your account or otherwise use the GAMEGUYZ Services. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we don't need to ask you for your password on each page. Once you log out or close your browser, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect.

We also use longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to display your e-mail address on our sign-in form, so that you don't have to retype the e-mail address each time you log in to your account.

We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website.

We and our service-providers also use cookies to customize our services, content and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.

You may encounter cookies from third parties when using the GAMEGUYZ Services on certain websites that we do not control (for example, if you view a webpage created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie placed by that web page or application).

## How do we update the information?

Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.

We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical.

Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.

## Enforcement

We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.

## Changes

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
