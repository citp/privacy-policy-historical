**Newsletters**  
GameSheep.com uses email as the main method of contact with its users. When signing up to become a member of GameSheep.com, the user must agree to accept and cannot unsubscribe from non-promotional emails (e.g. emails containing invoices, support correspondence and subscriptioninformation).

These emails are transactional emails and usually occur each time an action is triggered on the site:

\- registration  
\- password change  
\- password reminder  
\- internal messages from other users

GameSheep.com also sends newsletters, periodically. Subscribing to the newsletters is optional and free for all users. GameSheep.com newsletters contain new site games and top members. Ocasionally GameSheep.com sends promotional newsletters on behalf of our customers. Your personal information is NOT shared to any third party without your prior consent.

Additional information collected for each sent newsletter is:

\- number of newsletter opens  
\- number of clicks on each link inside a newsletter

**Subscribe / Unsubscribe methodology for GameSheep.com promotional newsletters**  
Each newsletter subscription needs to be confirmed. The confirmation (double opt in) is done by sending an initial greeting email, where a user action is needed to confirm the subscription, by clicking the unique personalized confirmation link. This way we ensure that the user agrees upon joining the newsletter list, and that the email addresses are real.

Each newsletter received has clear information about the sender and unsubscribe methods. The unsubscribe is fulfilled within seconds after clicking the unsubscribe link and no further newsletters will be sent to the users who have stated that they do not wish to receive the specified information, unless they choose to register to the newsletter again.

**Policy Modifications**  
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when GameSheep.com makes changes to this privacy statement, we will highlight the changes on our homepage and email users who have given us permission to do so.
