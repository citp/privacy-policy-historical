**7\. COOKIES**

7.1 We use cookies and similar technologies such as local storage within our apps to provide and optimise our Service. You can control which cookies you get and which you keep on your device through your browser settings. Unless you have adjusted your browser settings so that it will refuse our cookies, our system will issue cookies when you visit our website. However, if you do not accept cookies you may not be able to take advantage of many of the special features of the Service.

7.3 You can disable cookies on your device or set your device to alert you when cookies are being sent to your device; however, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use the Services. 

7.4 You can find the full text of our Cookie policy [here](http://www.game-insight.com/en/site/cookiepolicy). 

**8\. LINKS**

Our Service may contain links to and from other websites and Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any third party sites. Please check the individual Privacy Notice of any such websites or Services before you submit any personal information to them. 

**9\. ADVERTISERS**

Please note that we show third party advertising in our games and also advertise our Services via third parties. We wanted to provide you with more detail about how we use information for advertising, both in-game and on other third party properties. 

_**When you view ads on Game Insight’s properties**_

To enable us to show in-game ads we may send your advertising ID, IP-address and other information to advertisers (or ad networks) to enable them to find appropriate ads to serve to you in our games and on third party properties. You can control and limit our use of your advertising ID in your device settings. Game Insight does not control which specific ads are shown in our games (this is controlled by ad networks) but we do blacklist certain categories of ads. 

Advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes, for example, to: 

  * limit the number of times you see the same ad;
  * ensure they are dealing with humans/with real devices and not automated bots;
  * to serve you with advertisements likely to be relevant to you; 
  * other brands buy advertisement placement via an ad network or ad exchange to advertise their products in Game Insight’s games. The ad network or ad exchange acts as intermediary between the other game companies and Game Insight. In order for an ad network to charge the company buying the ad, clicks from the ad and potentially installs of other developers’ applications party apps are tracked. Views, clicks, installs and similar events from ads are measured using Advertiser ID. 



IP-address is typically used by advertisers to broadly see the general geographic area you are coming from for example country, state, and sometimes at city level. 

_**When you view Game Insight’s ads on third party services**_

Game Insight also advertises its games in other apps by asking ad networks to serve its ads to audiences that will be interested in them. The advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes, including, for example, to measure ad effectiveness (looking at aggregated views, clicks and installs it generates through its advertising in other publishers’ games). Advertising IDs are also used to track views, clicks, installs and other similar events from ads. 

You can opt out of interest based advertising on mobile applications by changing the privacy settings of your device and selecting "limit ad tracking" (Apple iOS) or "opt out of interest based ads" (Android). 

**10\. KEEPING YOUR ACCOUNT SECURE**

10.1 Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and you are responsible for any misuse of such information. You must change your password on a regular basis and must not share your password with anyone. 

10.2 You are solely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your account. Please ensure that you do not allow anyone else to access the Service in your name and sign off after you have finished accessing your account. 

10.3 You are responsible for all orders, and for the accuracy of all information, sent via the internet using your user ID, password or any other personal identification used to identify you on the Services. 

**11\. YOUR RIGHTS**

11.1 You have the following rights over the personal information we hold about you: 

(a) **to access, correct, update or request deletion** of your personal information; 

(b) **to object to processing** of your personal information (which is processed on the grounds of legitimate interests), ask us to **restrict processing** of your personal information or **request** **portability** of your personal information (request that data which you have provided to us is provided to you, so you can transfer this to another data controller); 

(c) to opt-out of personalized offers based on your in-game activities and behavior and to object to use your personal information for direct marketing purposes; 

(d) if we are processing your personal information with your consent, you can **withdraw your consent** at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. 

(e) you have **the right to complain** to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. 

You may exercise all the above mentioned rights by creating an in-game support ticket or by contacting us using the details at "How to Contact Us" section below. 

You can control and limit the nature of personal information that we collect and process about you in a number of ways. For example, you can disconnect your social media account from our games or control your social media privacy settings to limit the information shared with us. You could also reset your mobile advertising identifier or limit ad tracking altogether using the settings on your device. You could also limit or disable the use of cookies (or similar technologies). 

We will respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. 

11.2 If you have any questions, would like to contact us about the processing of your information or wish to exercise your rights as described above, you may contact us at [support@game-insight.com](http://support@game-insight.com/). We may require evidence of your identity before we are able to act on your request.
