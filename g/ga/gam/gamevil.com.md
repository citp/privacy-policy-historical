We may provide your information to third party companies (the “Third Party Service Providers”) that perform services on our behalf, including, without limitation, operation of the HIVE platform, data analysis, marketing services, promotional events, email campaigns, hosting services, and customer service or support.  The Third Party Service Providers may access your personal data, but are required to use it solely as directed by us for performing requested services.  We will ask for your consent before we share your data with the Third Party Service Providers.

b. Business Partners. In conjunction with the running of GAMEVIL Games via the HIVE Platform, we are partnering with Com2us Corporation and its affiliates (collectively, the “Business Partners”) in order to:

  * - enable you to receive from the Business Partners any information, newsletter or notification regarding Business Partners’ games provided via the HIVE Platform; and

We may share with our Business Partners the information you provide about yourself, such as (i) your HIVE Account Registration information, (ii) your profile information, (iii) your telephone number, (iv) any technical and usage information we collect, and/or (v) game play information, to the extent that such disclosure may serve the above-mentioned purposes and/or facilitate your use of the HIVE Platform service.

After clicking on one of these advertisements, you will no longer be on a site hosted by us.  To properly credit User accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier will be shared with the offer wall provider.  This identifier is used to ensure proper crediting of your account, prevent fraud or duplicate offers and to resolve any customer service inquiries that may arise.  We will ask for your consent before we share your personal data with the Advertisers.
