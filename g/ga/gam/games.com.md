**What information does Infogrames collect and how will it be used?**

In order to give you the best experience on our site, Infogrames may collect information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Typically, we may ask a user to submit personal and/or demographic information, and it will usually take the form of either: (1) game-specific registration; (2) community registration; (3) technical product support; (4) placement of an order for goods or services in the event Infogrames launches an online store; (5) sending an e-card to a friend; (6) submitting a question or comment to our webmaster; and/or, (7) personal information submitted in a business capacity (e.g., resumes). The types of information requested for each activity and the way the information is used are detailed below. 

> **Game Specific Registration**
> 
> Almost all game pages that appear on our sites provide you the opportunity to register to receive the latest news and information about a particular game (i.e., Subscription Center). If you choose to subscribe, you may be prompted to submit personal information such as your full name, home address, phone number and email address. Additionally, we may ask you for some demographic information including your age, gender, the game systems you own, and the types of games you play. The information you provide on this registration form will be used to send you, via email, game news and information tailored to your game and platform preferences. In addition, we may use the information to send you notices that contain additional information, discounts, and offers from Infogrames, unless you opt out from receiving such notices at the time of registration or at a later time. 
> 
> **Community Forum Registration**
> 
> To register for membership in our online community, we may ask you to provide personal information such as your email address, and to create a username and password. We may also collect demographic information about you, including your occupation, hobbies and interest, and other preferences. The information that you submit to us for this purpose is used to give you access to our community forums and other community features.   
>  The ability to participate in the community forums by simply logging in is available to only those Web users that have already created a password during an earlier visit to the community registration area of our site. To login as a member, we may ask you to submit your username and password. This information is collected so that you can access and participate in the community forums without having to reregister.   
>  Please note that whenever you give out personal information in public areas such as on our community forums, that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While we strive to protect those who wish to participate in these forums, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you post in these areas. When you register for the community forum, you have the option to make your email address inaccessible to other users of the forum.
> 
> **Technical Support**
> 
> To submit a question or problem to our technical support center using Infogrames' email form, you may be asked to provide your first and last name, date of birth, country, state or province, email address, telephone number, the date and location of your purchase, the name of the game in question, the operating system you are having the trouble on, and a description of the problem you are encountering. The information you provide us for this purpose is used to respond to the sender's troubleshooting problem.
> 
> **Online Store**
> 
> In the event Infogrames launches an online store for its web users, visitors purchasing goods or services may need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to name, mailing and billing addresses, phone number and e-mail address. In the event that we launch such an online store, we may also ask you to create a password so that when you return to our site, you can easily retrieve your shopping cart by logging in. 
> 
> **E-cards**
> 
> Web users who wish to send an e-card to a friend or family member may be asked to provide their name and email address, and the name(s) and email address(es) of the person(s) to whom they wish to send the e-card. After we send the E-card, we do not store the recipients' email addresses or use them for other purposes.
> 
> **Email to Webmaster**
> 
> Infogrames may collect and temporarily store personal information that you voluntarily submit to us via email correspondence. For example, Infogrames provides a link through which an online visitor can send e-mail to our Webmaster addressing any issue a user encounters when using our Website. Any personal information contained in such email is used by Infogrames for the sole purpose of responding to your questions. Although most e-mail messages are deleted after they are responded to, in certain cases hard copies or data from certain e-mail correspondence may be kept on file for security purposes. Any such copy or data will also be stored in a secure location, and information from these messages will not be used for marketing purposes.
> 
> **Resumes**
> 
> Infogrames allows for the online submission of resumes. Personal information collected from resumes will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings. Information obtained from resumes may be shared within our company.

  
In addition to the uses specified above, we may also use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs. Demographic information is similarly used to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying content according to their preferences.   
No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives.

**What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information?**

Your refusal to submit personal information may limit your ability to participate in some of our activities such as sweepstakes or community forums. However, you do not need to provide personal information to access and browse our Web sites. 

**Does Infogrames use cookies, track IP Addresses or use other passive means to collect information?**

Infogrames uses cookies on its Web site. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that Web sites often store on a user's computer. Cookies do not include people's names, e-mail addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user's computer and to "remember" things about the user's visit.

Infogrames also keep tracks of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for safety and security reasons. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.

**Who is collecting my personal information?**

The information you submit to our Web sites is collected by Infogrames Inc. and is used in the manner specified 

_above_. Contact information for Infogrames is provided below. 

**With whom does Infogrames share my personal information?**

It is our policy not to share your personal information with any third parties. However, this policy does not apply when disclosure is required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability. In addition, information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any bankruptcy, merger, sale, transfer of company assets, or acquisition. 

**Can I choose how my personal information is used?**

**What is Infogrames' policy regarding links to third party sites?**

You should be aware that while you are on a website operated by Infogrames, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control and for which we are not responsible. Because we cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of these websites meet our high standards and the requirements of the ESRB Privacy Online Program, we recommend that you read the privacy policy of the website to which you link before you submit any personal information.

**Does Infogrames collect personal information from children under 13?**

 _Collection and Use of Personal Information_

At this time, we collect and store personal information about children under 13 if it submitted by way of our email support page (accessible from the Technical Support area of our site) and is submitted after we've obtained verifiable parental consent. To determine who is younger than 13 years old and whether parental consent is required, we ask all users of our email support page to submit their age (i.e., date of birth). If given verifiable permission from a parent, Infogrames may collect and store the following types of personal information about a child under 13: first and last name, email address, and telephone number. Infogrames may also collect demographic information about a child such as the country and state in which the child lives, the child's date of birth, and a description of the hardware (e.g., operating system) and/or product the child has encountered a problem with; and, combine such information with the child's personal information. Infogrames will only collect this information if it is voluntarily submitted to us by the child. We do not collect personal information about a child through the use of passive collection mechanisms such as cookies.   
The information collected from a child is used by Infogrames for purposes of diagnosing a child's specific technical problem and providing an acceptable solution, and may be stored for purposes of providing ongoing technical support. From time to time, we may also receive requests relating to Frequently Asked Question documents (FAQ's), Hint documents, and/or patch disks or update disks related to a specific game or games, and we may use the child's contact information to respond to such requests. 

Under no circumstances will we ask the child to provide us more personal information than is reasonably necessary for the child to receive technical support help. 

_  
Third Parties_

Infogrames does not disclose personal information about children under 13 to third parties. However, this policy does not apply when disclosure is required to provide information to law enforcement agencies or investigations on matters related to public safety, to take precautions against liability, to respond to judicial process, or to protect the security or integrity of our website(s). 

_  
Parental Access_

As a parent, you have the right to view, update or delete your child's personal information and/or have Infogrames discontinue further collection or use of your child's personal information. To do so, please contact us by phone at 425-951-7106, or by regular mail at:

We will be happy to review, update, or delete your child's information as appropriate. Please make sure to have your child's email address available for verification purposes.
