# Privacy Policy

We want our users to always be aware of any information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

**Information collection and use**

For each visit to our website, our web server automatically recognizes only the visitors IP address, but not the email address. This information is primarily used  for general traffic tracking and security.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

Email addresses are collected if visitors subscribe our Game Alert Newsletter. Email addresses are then only used by Games 2 Download and not sold, rented, given, or shown to any other company for any use whatsoever. Our use of email addresses is to notify visitors of new games added to the site.

All subscribers always have an option to unsubscribe at any time. Our newsletter is double opt-in, meaning subscribers must confirm their desire to be on the list by clicking a link in an email sent to their sign up address. This is done to protect all email addresses from being mistakenly or fraudulently added to our list by 3rd parties.

**Cookies**

This site collects cookies. ( **[Definition of cookies](http://www.netlingo.com/right.cfm?term=cookies)** )  
We use cookies on this site to ensure the integrity of the purchase process for our Full Version games. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

**Notification of changes**

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement.
