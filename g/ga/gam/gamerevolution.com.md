**Newsletter**  
The subscribers of the GR weekly newsletter, [Spam Revolution](http://www.game-revolution.com/chatter/newsletter/newsletter.htm), are kept as a list of email addresses only. No other information is tied to or contained in this list and we have no idea who these maniacs are. The list is confidentially maintained by [freshaddress.com](http://www.freshaddress.com/). Opting in and out of all mailings can be done through the [freshaddress.com](http://www.freshaddress.com/) website. 

**Contest**  
GR has periodic contests giving away video and computer game oriented prizes. The demographic data collected by this contest for internal use only. It is used to assess our audience and to assist in the sale of advertising.

**IP Address  
**Your IP address is a number that is assigned by your ISP to your computer to identify it on the internet. GR uses your IP address to determine total site traffic, help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. We also sometimes use IP addresses to contact users and occasionally ban those users who are not complying with our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20021207181739id_/http%3A//www.gamerevolution.com/legal/terms.htm). 

**Public Forums**  
This site provides chat rooms, forums, message boards, and email discussion groups to its users. Use of these boards, and the entire site, is governed by GR's [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20021207181739id_/http%3A//www.gamerevolution.com/legal/terms.htm). Data collected from the bulletin boards is used for verification purposes only and is not used in any other way. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

**Other sites**  
GR contains links to other websites. We cannot be responsible for their content or for private information that they collect. Please note: Information you release directly to parties who provide services to Game Revolution, such as any services or vendors in the [SmartShop](http://www.game-revolution.com/store/buy.htm) or other sites you encounter on the Internet (even sites that are co-branded with Game Revolution) may be subject to different rules of use or disclosure. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing personal information to third parties. 

**Protection**  
Game Revolution uses industry standard protections, such as firewalls, to make sure that your data remains confidential. While we will not disclose all our security measures, they may also include machine gun towers, zombies, a moat, Lee Majors, pungee stakes, vicious guard monkeys, and a surly elf who will not relinquish the blue key. 

**No Warrantee**  
Nobody is perfect. We cannot completely ensure that your private communications and other personal information will not be disclosed to others. By way of example, without limiting the foregoing, under certain circumstances we may be forced to disclose information to the government, or hackers may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or we might disclose your information to other parties as part of providing additional services to you. Plus, our wives and girlfriends are extremely nosy. Therefore, although we try, we can not promise that your personal information or private communications will remain entirely private.

**COPPA Compliance**  
Game Revolution is not subject to the terms of COPPA because the site is not targeted at children under 13. Parts of the site contain depictions of violence, references to the consumption of alcohol and drugs, Taoist philosophy, nude video game characters, strong language, and the Spice Girls. The Game Revolution website is restricted by both Cyberpatrol and AOL Parental Controls. We urge concerned parents to get involved in their children's online experiences, rather than using those flawed tools as a crutch. 

Game Revolution is committed to protecting the privacy of children online. Children should not reveal their addresses, phone numbers or any other personal information to strangers on the Internet. Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from supplying Game Revolution with any personal information, through the above services or by any means, without first providing parental consent. This consent, in the form of a signed letter, must be submitted by mail to Game Revolution, 740 Gilman St., Berkeley, CA 94710.
