Privacy Policy

Introduction

Gamesxl.com respects the privacy of all Users of its site and ensures that the personal information you provide to us is treated as confidential. Personal information is processed and protected by us with due care. In this respect we comply with the requirements of the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act.   
You should realize that other interests, such as the investigation into illegal activities, may in some cases prevail over your right to privacy.

Gamesxl.com, a part of Admeen B.V., is responsible for the processing of the data. In this privacy statement, we explain which personal data we collect and use, and for what purpose. Because our processing falls within the statutory exemption schemes, it has not been reported to the Dutch Data Protection Authority.

Attention! If you're not 16 yet, you should first ask your parents or legal representative (hereinafter: Parents) for permission for providing your personal data and for using our Website!

This privacy policy is also available in the form of a [PDF file](http://www.gamesxl.com/files/privacy_policy.pdf "Privacy policy"), so you can easily save and print it.

Recording and processing of data

By using the Website you leave behind certain personal information. In this respect a distinction can be made between (personal) data provided actively and (personal) data provided passively. Personal data provided actively are the data that you have filled in yourself on the Website. For instance, your name, email address, that you are asked to fill in when registering on the site. The messages posted by you through your profile may also contain personal data. Data provided passively are the data that are stored automatically during your surfing on the Website, perhaps without your being aware of this. For instance, the IP address and the operating system of your computer, and the browser you are using. If you are logged in to the Website as a User, both actively and passively provided personal data will be stored. If you are not logged in, only passively provided personal data will be stored.

By making use of the Website in a well thought out manner, you can control to a major extent what personal data you will provide to us.

We will not make available the personal data linked to your profile to third parties unless we are legally obliged to do so or you have given your explicit permission to do so.  
In the case of (suspected) fraud or abuse of our Website, we may hand over personal data to the competent authorities.  
Also in the event that the Website is taken over by another owner it will be necessary to provide all data to that new owner.

Parents and Children

Are you younger than 16? If so, you should ask your parents for permission for entering your personal information.  
Are you the father, mother or legal representative of a child playing games on our site and do you wish to withdraw your permission? You can do so at any time. Below a description of how it works is given.

In order to cancel an account / a profile the Parent should have access to the email address associated with the account to be deleted. Upon request, the Parent will receive an email message from Gamesxl.com sent to the Parent's email address (that email address should not be the email address of the account to be deleted!) containing a link to our Website. By clicking on the link a specially designed page on Gamesxl.com is opened. On this page a number of data of the Parent and of the profile to be removed are displayed. Here, the Parent should fill in additional information, such as a name, address and telephone number. When the data are sent, an email message will be sent to the email address associated with the account / profile to be deleted. The Parent will have to open this email message containing a link to disable/remove the account.
