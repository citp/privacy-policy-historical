# Privacy Policy

**Information We Collect:**

GamingBolt is a video games coverage website, run by Gamers for the Gamers. Our aim is to provide the best possible experience for our readers and that also means we respect their privacy. We do not have a registration system for our users, so this means we do not collect personal identifiable information about you, such as your name, address or telephone number etc except in two cases which are described below.

_Case 1: Giveaways/Contests:_ Email address may be required for rare cases (such as giveaways and contests), in which case we will notify you.

_Case 2: Disqus Comments System:_ Our comments system is powered by [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) and [Disqus Comment System](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-comment-system/) plugin for WordPress. Disqus requires our readers to either create a Disqus account using your name, email and password (in this case we strongly suggest not using your real name) or you can also post without a Disqus account by just providing your name and email ( again, in this case we strongly suggest not using your real name). You can also create a Disqus account using your Twitter, Facebook or Google accounts.

The Disqus Comment System plugin for WordPress collects your comments data (such as comments, user name, email address, IP address). So if you want to delete or modify them, please get in touch with us at admin@gamingbolt.com with all required details such as a copy of the comment and the URL on which the comment was posted so that we can remove/modify/edit it (those comments will be treated [with respect to our comments policy)](https://gamingbolt.com/gamingbolts-community-policy).

We encourage you to read our comments policy by clicking the link [here](https://gamingbolt.com/gamingbolts-community-policy).

Also note that, commenting on our articles is completely optional so if you are uncomfortable to share your details, you can completely avoid commenting all together!

**Cookies:**

We also use third party advertisements and services on GamingBolt.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers and service providers may use technology such as cookies that collect information (which does not include personally identifiable information such as your name or email address). Some of these companies may use this information about your visits to this site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. GamingBolt will not sell or rent any of your personal information to anyone.

We also use cookies for Google Analytics which is used for traffic statistics. In order to further respect the privacy of users, we have switched on anonymous IP tracking in our Google Analytics code.

**Questions or Comments?**

Please contact us at admin@gamingbolt.com for any questions. We will get back to you as soon as possible hopefully to make GamingBolt a better place for everyone.
