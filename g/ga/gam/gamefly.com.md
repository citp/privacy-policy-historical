This Privacy Policy does _not_ extend to any websites, applications or services of any third-party companies or organizations to which we link or which link to us. GameFly does not operate or control those websites, applications or services.

_* Review the privacy policy of any third-party website, application or service linked to or accessible from our site before you submit any personal information to such parties._

We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to make changes from time to time (with or without notice) to this Policy. As such, you should review this Policy periodically to check for updates.

_* By using our Website or App, you signify your assent to GameFly's Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, delete all cookies from your browser cache after visiting our Website and do not visit or use our Website or App. Your continued use of our Website or App will signify your acceptance of these terms._

##### Use of information that you provide to us

Typically, we ask you to submit personal, financial and/or demographic information if you decide to:

  * Register for and use a GameFly Account (e.g., to rent or buy games, sign-up for newsletters)
  * Register for and use the GameFly Application
  * Use our GameFly Referrals feature
  * Use our GameFly SMS Alerts feature
  * Use our Buy Alerts feature
  * "Contact Us"



_* To simply browse our Website or App, you are not required to provide any personal information. However, if you choose not to submit personal information when requested to do so, you may not be able to access some or all of the services that we provide._

**GameFly Account Registration**  
To create a GameFly account, we ask you for certain personally identifying information, including your full name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, and billing information (such as a credit card number). We also ask you to create a password and to provide other information such as your gender, game and platform preferences (e.g., about the games and hardware you own), hobbies and interests, and other information (including "demographic information") as part of your user profile - we may link this demographic information to your personal information.

Once collected, we use the information above to: (i) create, confirm and give you access to your GameFly account; (ii) process and ship your orders; (iii) communicate with you (via e-mail, SMS or phone) about the status of your orders or to provide Buy Alerts and SMS messages you request; (iv) answer any requests that you may have; (v) send you GameFly newsletters that you have chosen to receive; and (vi) serve advertisements to your Web browser that we believe may be of interest to you ( **see "Online Advertising" below for more information** ).

We ask you to provide other information as part of your "bio" or "profile," such as your gender, location and social network URLs and to create a user picture/avatar to display to others on the App. We may also collect your unique device identifier and your telephone number and location if you have activated the GPS function on your mobile device. The foregoing information is used to identify you to us and other users as a GameFly App user and to allow you to access the functionality provided on the App, such as posting messages and receiving App updates (e.g., when another App user responds to one of your posts, etc.). Note that you can link the information contained in your GameFly and App accounts.

_* You can create a GameFly App account without providing all of the requested information above. The information you do provide will be visible by other App users as part of your profile, but you have the ability to control whether your full name, age or gender are displayed - the default settings for these are all set to "Off."_

**GameFly Referrals**  
When you use the GameFly Referrals Program (or the "Referral Program"), we may ask you to provide you and your friends' first names and e-mail addresses. This information is used to email them a promotional communication offering a free GameFly trial membership or discount pre-paid membership, and the opportunity to make further referrals to their friends. You and/or your friends may receive additional communications from us or our vendors in relation to the Referral Program and you and/or your friends' participation in it. The data collected through the Referral Program is used only for the operation and ongoing maintenance of the Referral Program and will not be used for any other purpose or distributed to any third parties other than those GameFly vendors retained to operate and maintain the Referral Program.

_* You and your friends may opt-out of participation in the Referral Program at any time via the opt-out links in the communications sent to you and your friends, or by sending us an e-mail to[friends_optout@gamefly.com](mailto:friends_optout@gamefly.com)._

We may share your information with third parties in certain situations outlined below.

**Third Party Service Providers**  
We work with third-party companies, agents, and contractors ("Vendors") to perform some important tasks, such as processing credit card transactions, fulfilling and delivering your orders, operating and maintaining our Referral Program, and marketing/advertising programs. We require that our Vendors maintain the confidentiality of any information about our members that may be disclosed to them and to use such information solely for the purpose of providing the contracted-for services on GameFly's behalf.

**Online Advertising Practices**  
 _Advertising Third-party Products & Services:_ The third-party ads appearing on our Website are delivered to your browser by DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner. DoubleClick may set and access its own cookies on your Web browser in order to serve ads it believes may be of interest to you based on the profile information you provided to us at registration (e.g., demographic information) as well as information collected about you by DoubleClick elsewhere on the Web. DoubleClick may use information about you gathered from our website (including your demographic information provided to us upon registration as well as your browsing behavior on our site) to serve third party ads to you elsewhere on the Internet. DoubleClick's use of cookies on our Website is subject to DoubleClick's privacy policies. For more information about DoubleClick and how cookies work, please visit [DoubleClick's website](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/) and the [Network Advertising Initiative's homepage](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). _Please see “Can I choose how my personal information is used?” below to learn more about setting your Web browser to block cookies._

_Advertising GameFly Products & Services:_ After you visit our website, our advertising partners may deliver GameFly ads to your Web browser when you are visiting other sites on the Internet. These ads are delivered based on cookies that are set by our third party advertising network partners when you visit our Website, and that are recognized by these companies when you visit other sites. _Please see “Can I choose how my personal information is used?” below to learn more about setting your Web browser to block cookies._

**Social Networking**  
Our Website and App may contain links to other sites where third parties may collect, store or share information about you. We clearly mark those links on our Website and App so you will know if you are submitting your information to a third party (e.g., to a social network such as Facebook or Twitter). As noted above, GameFly does not operate or control those third-party sites, so please review the privacy policy of any linked site before providing any personal information or using any feature of a social networking site that is linked to our Website or App.

Through our App, you can connect with friends, display your game rentals and purchases; discuss games with the community of users, follow or be-followed-by other gamers; and engage in other aspects of social networking. As noted above, some of your personal information, such as your name, gender, age, and other profile information, may be displayed publicly to other members of the App. You can control the information that is publicly displayed to the App community by managing your Privacy Settings in the App; and you can control whether to publicly post a message or whether you have added/bought/kept a game.

**Co-Sponsors and Promotional Partners**  
We may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities ("Events") on our Website and/or App. Information collected for these Events may include personal information (e.g., name, mailing address, etc.) and may be collected by or shared with a third-party sponsor, co-sponsor, or other third party (e.g., promotional partner, retailer, or game or magazine publisher). _If you provide information to such third parties, we cannot control those third parties' use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, do not to participate in these events._

From time to time, we are approached by third party companies and organizations that provide game-related special offers or other offers that we believe may be of interest to you. To extend these offers to you, we may use your GameFly account information to send out promotional mailings to you on their behalf. If you select to sign up for the third party offer, we will share your GameFly account information with the third party offer provider. We see this as a value-added service helping you find useful products or services. We will not share your information with the third party offer provider unless you chose to take advantage of the third party offer.

In some instances, we may have an arrangement with a promotional partner or retailer, whereby they share with us customer information collected on their website. In the event that we receive such data and combine it with our customer records, the combined information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, all such information is subject to the privacy policy under which it was collected.

**Disclosure and/or Transfer of Personal Information**  
We may disclose any or all personal or non-personal information related to you to support an investigation or if we have a good faith belief that it is required by law, including but not limited to requests pursuant to subpoena or court order, and/or disclosure to local, state, or federal law enforcement, or other government officials pursuant to investigations they are conducting. In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, any customer information in our possession may be transferred to our successor or assign.

**Aggregate Information**  
We may provide our prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties with aggregate data about members and visitors to the GameFly Website. However, such data is anonymous, and we will not disclose personally identifying information about specific users.

_If you wish to opt out of having cookies set on your browser for purposes of online advertising, the only way to ensure that this happens is to manage the settings on your Web browser to delete all cookies and then disallow the further acceptance of cookies._ Preventing your browser from accepting cookies prevents GameFly and our advertising partners from tracking you or your browsing behavior.

##### What is the GameFly policy regarding children?

You must be 18 years or older to create a GameFly account and become a member. While children under the age of 18 may utilize the GameFly video game rental/purchase service, they may do so only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian and subject to our **Terms of Use**. We encourage parents to use our Parental Controls feature, which will allow you to control which games your child can rent or purchase under your account. Therefore, if a parent or guardian is the account holder and manages Parental Controls, the account password should not be disclosed to the child. Note that the GameFly Website and the GameFly App are not directed at collecting information from children under the age of 13, nor are they intended to be used by children under the age of 13. If we receive notice that we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13, we will take all reasonable steps to delete the information collected from that child.

##### How does GameFly protect my personal information?

GameFly employs security technologies and procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information collected from our Website visitors. GameFly uses a secure server to encrypt all of your personal information. The secure server employs Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, which is a reasonable industry standard method of encryption. We have also implemented reasonable security guidelines for our employees, partners, and vendors. We will continue to update and enhance our security practices as new technology becomes available.

While we take steps to ensure the security of your personal information, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, please be aware that when you submit information to us, you do so at your own risk. To further protect your personal information, we ask that you play an important role as well. Take care to prevent unauthorized persons from learning any of your GameFly account information.

You are solely responsible for safeguarding your GameFly and GameFly App e-mail logins and passwords. To prevent unauthorized use of your accounts, be sure to change your password often, and keep it in a safe place.
