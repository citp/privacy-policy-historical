GameFly respects the privacy rights of our online visitors and is committed to protecting the personal information collected about you. To further this commitment, we have adopted this Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to guide how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us online. 

This Privacy Statement and the certification seal located on this page confirm that GameFly is a valid licensee and participating subscriber in the [Entertainment Software Rating Board's Privacy Online Program: ESRB Privacy Online](http://www.esrb.org/privacy.asp). To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all of our websites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our sites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by ESRB Privacy Online. 

Because the website you are currently visiting displays the ESRB Privacy Online certification seal, you can expect to be informed about the following. 

  * The scope of this Privacy Policy
  * Exactly what information GameFly may collect from you through its website(s) 
  * How GameFly will use the information it collects

  * Whether GameFly uses cookies or other passive collection tools on its website(s) 
  * Who collects the information that you disclose on a GameFly website

  * What choices you can make regarding how your personal information is used

**What does this Privacy Policy apply to?**  
The website you are currently visiting is operated by GameFly located in Los Angeles, California. This Privacy Policy currently applies to the following website(s) operated by GameFly (collectively referred to as the "GameFly Website," "our Website," or “GameFly.com”): 

[www.gamefly.com](http://www.gamefly.com/)

In the future, if we wish to include additional websites under this Privacy Policy, we will take reasonable steps to list them above and ensure that they provide a link to this Privacy Policy. 

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through the GameFly Website (as listed above), and does 

_not_ apply to information that may be collected by GameFly offline. In addition, this Privacy Policy does _not_ extend to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link or which link to us. Because we cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of such sites meet our high standards and the requirements of the ESRB Privacy Online Program, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of the website to which you link before you submit any personal information to that site. 

_Please note that by using our Website, you signify your assent to GameFly's Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Website. We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Please check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of these changes. Your continued use of our Website will signify your acceptance of these changes. Please note that if we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our Website or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change._

**What types of information does GameFly collect and how is it used?**

In order to give you the best experience on our Website, GameFly may collect information about you. Typically, we may ask you to submit personal and/or demographic information if you decide to: 

  * sign up for a GameFly account (i.e., purchase a rental subscription plan); 
  * use our Tell a Friend feature; and/or, 
  * send us a message using our “Contact Us” form. 

The types of information requested for each feature above and the way the information is used are detailed by category below. Under all circumstances, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives. _GameFly Account Registration_

To create a GameFly account, we ask you for certain personally identifying information, including your full name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, and billing information (such as a credit card number). We may also ask you to create a password and to provide other non-personal information such as your gender, game and platform preferences (including information about the games and hardware you own), hobbies and interests, and other information (also known as "demographic information"); and, we may link this demographic information to your personal information. 

Once collected, we use the information above to: (i) create and give you access to your GameFly account; (ii) process and ship your orders; (iii) communicate with you (via e-mail or phone) about the status of your orders; (iv) answer any requests that you may have; and, (v) send you GameFly newsletters. 

From time to time, we are approached by third party companies and organizations that provide game-related special offers or other offers that we believe may be of interest to you. To extend these offers to you, we may use your GameFly account information to send out promotional mailings on their behalf. If you decide to sign up for a third party offer, then with your consent we may also share your GameFly account information with the third party offer provider. We see this as a value-added service helping you find useful products or services. We strive to limit the notices and communications to those that we think you would appreciate receiving. If you want to be excluded from these promotional mailings, you may opt out by logging in to [Your Account](http://www.gamefly.com/member/account.asp) and updating your E-mail Subscriptions. 

We may use your GameFly account e-mail address to send you service-related announcements that tell you about updates to our Privacy Policy or [Terms of Use](http://www.gamefly.com/help/termsofuse.asp), new areas or features on our Website, changes to our online service or technical support policies, and other related changes. 

We may also use your personal and demographic information in aggregate for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs. 

_Tell a Friend_

When you use the GameFly Referral Program (or "Refer a Friend" feature), we ask you to provide your friends' first names and e-mail addresses and - if you're not a GameFly subscriber - your first name and e-mail address. In return, we provide your friends with a choice of a free GameFly trial subscription or discount pre-paid subscription. This feature helps us spread the word about GameFly. First names and e-mail addresses submitted to us for this program are used only to send this offer and are subsequently deleted. 

_Contact Us Form_

If you choose to contact us using this form, we may ask you to provide your first name, e-mail address, and a description of your question or comment. This form is intended for questions and comments only. We use the information you provide solely to respond to your inquiry and for no other purpose. We may retain and aggregate your comments for demographic purposes and to improve our service. 

**What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information to GameFly?**

If you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you will not be able to rent or buy video games from GameFly and it will limit the services we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to share your email address, you will not be able to create a GameFly account or receive our newsletter. To simply browse our Websites, however, you do not need to give us any personal information. 

**Does GameFly use cookies, or other passive means to collect information?**

Like many Web sites, GameFly.com sets “cookies” on your computer. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser, allowing us to automatically identify you when you return to our Website. They help us to match the games you’ve chosen to rent or buy with your individual account, and to personalize the GameFly.com Website for you. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your personally identifying information. If cookies are not enabled on your Web browser, you will not be able to use the GameFly Website or the GameFly service. The “help” menu on most Web browsers will tell you how to enable cookies. 

Your order and billing history are also tracked automatically from the beginning of your GameFly subscription. This allows you to log in to [Your Account](http://www.gamefly.com/member/account.asp) and see a complete list of games you’ve rented or bought from us. 

**Who is collecting my personal information and is it shared with anyone?**

The information that you disclose on the GameFly Websites is collected by GameFly or by a vendor on GameFly's behalf; and, is used in accordance with the practices set forth above. A breakdown of our data disclosure policies follows. 

_Agents and Contractors_

We use outside companies, agents, and contractors (“vendors”) to perform some important GameFly tasks, such as processing credit card transactions and delivering your orders. In the course of doing so, these vendors can come into contact with some of your personally identifying information. However, we only give them access to the information they need in order to actually perform their tasks, and they are bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy-that is, they must treat your personal information the same way we do. 

If you decide to join our affiliate program, please note that the information collected on the publisher application form is collected and controlled by Commission Junction (not GameFly) and is therefore subject to their privacy policy. Once collected, Commission Junction may share certain publisher information with us to help facilitate the affiliation or allow us to contact a publisher directly. 

_Co-Sponsors and Promotional Partners_

From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities ("events") on our Website. Information collected for these events may include personal information (e.g., name, mailing address, etc.) and may be collected by or shared with a third party sponsor, co-sponsor, or other reputable third party (e.g., promotional partner, retailer, or game or magazine publisher). While we have no control over the third party's use of such information, we will attempt to ensure that they agree to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of any personal information we share with them (or that they collect through our Website). If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these events at the time of the contest/event or when the information is collected. 

In some instances, we may have an arrangement with a promotional partner or retailer, whereby they share with us customer information collected on their website. In the event that we receive such data and combine it with our customer records, the combined information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, all such information is subject to the privacy policy under which it was collected. 

_Legal and Business Transfers_

We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to local, state, or federal law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, theft, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability. In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, GameFly's customer information may be transferred to our successor or assign. 

_Aggregate Information_

We may provide our prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties with aggregate data about subscribers and visitors to the GameFly Website. However, such data is anonymous, and we do not disclose personally identifying information about specific users. 

**Can I choose how my personal information is used?**

If you wish to opt out of receiving the GameFly newsletter, special offers, and promotional information, log in to [Your Account](http://www.gamefly.com/member/account.asp) and change your E-mail Subscriptions; or, contact [support@gamefly.com ](https://web.archive.org/help/contactus.asp). In addition, at the bottom of every GameFly newsletter sent to you, we provide you the opportunity to discontinue receiving future communications (i.e., unsubscribe). 

**How can I view or update my personal information?**

To view or update your name, e-mail address, password, billing address, credit card number, e-mail subscription preferences, or other account information, log in to [Your Account](http://www.gamefly.com/member/account.asp). There is a link to [Your Account](http://www.gamefly.com/member/account.asp) on most pages of the GameFly Website. Please note that you must log in with your e-mail address and password before you can update any account information. 

If you believe that your account information contains errors, and you cannot correct those errors from the [Your Account](http://www.gamefly.com/member/account.asp) page, please contact [Customer Service](http://www.gamefly.com/help/contactus.asp). 

**What is GameFly's policy regarding children?**

Though the GameFly service is fun for all ages, you must be 18 years or older to create a GameFly account and become a subscriber. Parents who wish to create an account on behalf of their children may do so, provided that the parent is the account holder. We encourage parents to use our Parental Controls feature, which will allow you to control which games your child can rent or purchase under your account. 

**What safeguards does GameFly use to protect my personal information?**

GameFly maintains industry standard procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information collected from our Website visitors. GameFly uses a secure server to encrypt all of your personal information. The secure server employs Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, the most advanced encryption method available today. 

To protect your information from unauthorized access or use, we use only the most advanced technology and security features for the GameFly Website. We will continue to update and enhance our security practices as new technology becomes available. We have also implemented strict security guidelines for our employees, partners, and vendors. 

While we make every effort to ensure the security of your personal information, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, please be aware that when you submit information to us, you do so at your own risk. To further protect your personal information, we ask that you play an important role as well. Take care to prevent unauthorized persons from learning any of your GameFly account information. 

You are solely responsible for safeguarding your GameFly e-mail login and password. To prevent unauthorized use of your account, be sure to change your password often, and keep it in a safe place. 

**How do I ask a question or file a complaint? (Contact Information)**
