# GameHouse - Privacy Policy

Information gathered during voluntary player registration is used solely by GameHouse.com, and the information will not be sold to any third party. Registrants who check the box requesting promotional information may receive e-mail on behalf of GameHouse.com, which appears to come from another company. In these cases, the other company has not been given access to e-mail addresses. Players may elect not to receive these e-mails during registration. Players who wish to no longer receive e-mails on behalf of GameHouse.com may e-mail [support@gamehouse.com](mailto:support@gamehouse.com) and request to be removed from the e-mail list.

GameHouse.com may offer incentives to provide other voluntary information. This information is kept strictly confidential, will not be sold to any third party, and is used primarily to survey our users for advertising purposes.
