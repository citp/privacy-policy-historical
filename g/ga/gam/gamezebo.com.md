Like most website operators, Gamezebo collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Gamezebo’s website choose to interact with Gamezebo in ways that require Gamezebo to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Gamezebo gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
