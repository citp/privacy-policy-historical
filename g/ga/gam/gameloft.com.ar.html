                <h1><strong>GAMELOFT PRIVACY POLICY</strong></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gameloft Inc. and its websites, games and other applications ("we," "our" or "us") believe that your privacy is very important. This Policy outlines the types of personally identifiable information and other data that we will collect from you through the various websites, games and applications we provide ("Websites/Apps"), and how we will use and when we might disclose such information and data to third parties. Your installation and/or use of these Websites/Apps and/or submission of information to us constitute your consent to this Privacy Policy and the processing of your information (personal and non-personal) as described in this Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 1, 2008 and was last modified on July 6, 2016.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>There are two types of information we may collect through your use of the Websites/Apps:</strong></h2>

<ol>
  <li>“<strong>Personal Information</strong>,” which is the type of information that specifically identifies you personally and/or can be used alone to contact you online or offline, such as your full name, physical address, email address, telephone number, photograph, precise geolocation information (i.e., your specific location), Gameloft player ID, credit card information and, in some cases, usernames; and</li>
  <li>&nbsp;“<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>,” which is information that does not identify you and cannot be used to contact you personally, including information about you such as your date of birth, age, ZIP code, non-precise geolocation information (e.g., your city), and gender, as well as information about your computer and mobile device, such as your unique device ID, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or other persistent identifiers, and their hardware/software/firmware. Non-Personal Information also includes “<strong>Usage Data</strong>,” which is anonymous data tied to your computer and/or device, such as the actions you take within and outside of the Websites/Apps, the browser you use, the identity of other apps included on your device, the date and time of your use of the Websites/Apps, your game progress, play time, score and achievements, and the URLs you visited and/or apps you used before and after using our Websites/Apps.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Personal Information and Non-Personal Information That We Collect and How We Collect It</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you choose to open an account with us, register for a contest, sign up for our newsletter, request support, or in any other way take steps that require the submission of Personal Information or Non-Personal Information, we may collect information such as your name, email address, physical address, date of birth, gender and/or phone number.</li>
  <li>If you choose to connect to one of our Websites/Apps through a third-party social network such as Facebook or Game Center, we may collect Personal Information and Non-Personal Information from your profile on such third-party social networks, such as your name, username, photograph, gender and date of birth.</li>
  <li>If you choose to make a purchase through our Websites/Apps, we will collect your credit card information and other billing information.</li>
  <li>If you choose to make use of any public forum, comment section, or chat function, we may collect any Personal Information you may disclose through such means.</li>
  <li>If you choose to send a message to another user or defined group of users through our message, chat, post or other in-game function, we may collect any Personal Information you may disclose through such means, as well as the necessary Personal Information of the user(s) you are contacting, in order to facilitate the communication (Note: we will never collect any information sent outside of the functionality of our Websites/Apps, including through emails or text messages).</li>
  <li>If you choose to enable push notifications, we may use your Personal Information, or Non-Personal Information such as a device ID, in order to send push notifications to your device.</li>

  <li>If you choose to submit your Personal Information to us for any other reason in any other form, we will collect such Personal Information and use it for the purposes for which you submitted it.</li>
  <li>We will not collect any Personal Information from you simply by virtue of your visiting our Website; we only collect it if you choose to submit it to us.

Such Non-Personal Information is not combined with Personal Information unless you choose to submit Personal Information to us.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Partnerships and External Sources</strong></h2>

<p>Our Websites/Apps may link to external sites beyond our control. This privacy policy covers only the way we treat the Personal Information and Non-Personal Information we collect on our Websites/Apps. By accessing any external sites, you are agreeing to the privacy policies of those sites. Please understand that the external sites may have different policies with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information. We have no control over and are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. Therefore, you are encouraged to review the privacy policies of all third-party Websites/Apps.

<p>If you apply for a job position, you will be directed to the SmartRecruiters website.

The collection of this Personal Information will be governed by the SmartRecruiters privacy policy, which you can view here: <a href="https://www.smartrecruiters.com/privacy-policy/" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">https://www.smartrecruiters.com/privacy-policy/</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Children</strong></h2>

<p>Many of our Websites/Apps are intended for general audiences, and we do not knowingly collect or use any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. When users are identified as under 13, we will block such users from providing Personal Information or make sure to get prior parental consent before collecting Personal Information. To the extent we feel that any of our Websites/Apps are directed to children under the age of 13, we will not collect Personal Information from users of those Websites/Apps.</p>

<p>If you are a parent of a child under 13 years of age and you believe your child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:PrivacyPolicyGameloft@gameloft.com" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_top">PrivacyPolicyGameloft@gameloft.com</a> and we will delete the information from our system.</p>

<p>We may collect Non-Personal Information, such as a device ID or other persistent identifier linked to the device or computer<strong>,</strong> which may be used by a child to play our Websites/Apps. The data collected will be anonymous and not tied to any Personal Information. In addition, this data will be used solely for internal purposes such as personalization of content, security, and contextual (not behavioral) advertising.</p>

<p>Certain of our Websites/Apps may permit in-game purchases, even if the applicable game was free to download. Such purchases do not always require the re-entry of credit card information because they may be made through an existing third-party account (such as an iTunes account). If you are a parent who is concerned about this feature, you may disable the ability to make in-game purchases by selecting the Settings tab for the applicable Website/App, and following the necessary prompts to prohibit such purchases.</p>

<p>If you are between the age of 13 and 18, please obtain your parents' permission prior to registering with our Platform or providing us with any Personal Information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Changes</strong></h2>

<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. In the event we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, such policy will be re-posted in the "Privacy" section of our Websites/Apps with the date such modifications were made indicated on the top of the page. Therefore, please review this Privacy Policy from time to time so that you are aware when any changes are made to this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Websites/Apps after such change constitutes your acceptance of any such change(s), and if you do not accept any changes, you may choose not to use the Websites/Apps or opt out by sending us an appropriate notice. If you would like further information about any recent changes made, please send your request to <a href="mailto:PrivacyPolicyGameloft@gameloft.com" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_top">PrivacyPolicyGameloft@gameloft.com</a> and include “Information about Changes” in the subject line.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Websites/Apps Security</strong></h2>

<p>It is entirely your choice whether or not you provide Personal Information to us. We and/or our third-party partners have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to attempt to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the Personal Information collected through the Websites/Apps. We take, or obligate applicable third parties to take, reasonable precautions to protect our customers' Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, please remember that no transmission of data over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us or from us, and you do so at your own risk. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us by email and you do so at your own risk.</p>

<p>When we use third parties to assist us in processing your Personal Information or credit card information we take reasonable steps to require that they comply with this Privacy Policy and otherwise protect your Personal Information (including any credit card information).</p>

<p>If there is a breach of security involving your credit card information from our Websites/Apps, we will inform you immediately and take commercially reasonable steps to rectify such breach.</p>

<p>If you believe your Personal Information is being improperly used by us or any third party, please immediately notify us via email at <a href="mailto:PrivacyPolicyGameloft@gameloft.com" style="text-decoration: underline;">PrivacyPolicyGameloft@gameloft.com</a>.</p>

<p>In the event you choose to establish an account with us, you should not share your login information with anyone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Your Privacy Right in California</strong></h2>

<p>Under certain circumstances, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 requires that, upon receipt of a request by a customer residing in California, a business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom Personal Information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year for direct marketing purposes, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.&nbsp; However, the foregoing does not apply to businesses like ours that do not disclose Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes without prior approval or that give customers a free mechanism to opt out of having their personal information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Users residing in California may request further information about our approach to this law by writing to us at <a href="mailto:PrivacyPolicyGameloft@gameloft.com" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_top">PrivacyPolicyGameloft@gameloft.com</a>, using the subject line “CA Request for Information,” and requesting further information.</p>

<p>Do Not Track Disclosures in California: Because we respect your privacy, we will abide by any “do not track” technology that you may choose to utilize, although, as described above with cookies, such technology may negatively affect the functionality of the Websites/Apps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
