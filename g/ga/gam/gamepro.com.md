**Information Collection and Use**  
GamePro.com collects optional data supplied by visitors to our web site through registration, surveys, sweepstakes or contests, as well as information that we gather from visitors via our server log. This information enables us to better tailor our content to your interests, and to help our advertisers better understand the audience they are reaching. Our site is completely free, and is supported by paid advertisements and it is therefore critically important for us to be able to identify our audience. Information is only shared with advertisers or any other third parties in aggregate form. We are also firmly committed to identifying whether information presented on our sites is written by our editorial staff or is contributed by a user or vendor. 

GamePro.com does its best to protect the privacy of our younger audience. We do not actively collect information through our Website from children aged 12 and under, without prior parental permission. We encourage parents to take an active role to protect the privacy of their children. In addition, we encourage parents to instruct their children never to give out real names or any other identifying information over the Internet without first getting permission and to monitor their Internet activities. 

**Use of IP Addresses**  
For each visitor to our site, our web server automatically records the visitor's domain and IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. 

**Use of Cookies**  
Cookies are small files that contain information a web site uses for tracking a visit. Our site uses cookies to authenticate who you are and what information you have registered for access to. We also use this to keep track of your service selections and to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. You password is encrypted within the cookie, so this cannot be accessed by any outside parties. As an option, a visitor may choose to reject a cookie and instead use their personal identifier each time they visit and select services that require authentication. Not all areas of our sites require authentication. We use an outside serving company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. 

**Use of Registration Data**  
Some optional services that GamePro.com offers require registration. Our site's registration process requests that users give us contact information (like their name and email address), unique identifiers for authentication, and demographic information that pertains to their profession such as business industry and job function. We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user relevant information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners, but only to those who opt to receive it. We deliver these messages ourselves, and do not allow email addresses or other contact information out of our control. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary, for the administration of prizes, rewards, or to respond to customer service requests. This information is only shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. Unique identifiers such as passwords, are collected to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our database. This site contains links to other sites and GamePro.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

**Ad Serving Technology**  
GamePro.com uses Doubleclick's ad serving technology (called DART) to serve advertising banners on our web site. Doubleclick is not privy to any registration information or log data that is gathered by GamePro.com. GamePro.com's contract with Doubleclick prevents the company from using any data collected from our site for any purpose other than aggregate reports and standard advertising reporting metrics which are delivered to our advertising clients under our direction. Neither GamePro.com nor any IDG business unit joined Doubleclick's Abacus Alliance, which is an effort to match data derived from cookies with the information in their databases. 

**User Reviews**  
By posting content on the Service, including, without limitation, any game reviews, you automatically grant, or warrant, that the owner of such content has expressly granted GMG the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive right and license to use, reproduce, publish, translate, sublicense, copy, and distribute the content in whole or in part worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or hereafter developed for the full term of any copyright that may exist in such content. In addition, you agree to permit any other user of the Service to access, store, or reproduce the content for that user's personal use. Subject to this grant, the owner of the content posted on the Service retains any and all rights which may exist in such content. 

**User Surveys**  
We occasionally run surveys that are optional to participate in. We only ask participants for contact information and demographic information that pertains to their gaming habits. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary, or for the delivery of prizes or rewards. Users may opt-out of receiving future survey mailings; please see the choice/opt-out section below. The survey data is only used in aggregate form and may be used to guide our editorial process or site development process. 

**Partner Sites**  
Information that is shared with or collected at partner sites is used to provide the services that the user selects at that site. Communication by our partners with GamePro.com customers is limited to the services that our customers select. For example, if a customer requests to be notified when information on a selected topic becomes available, the partner site may contact our customers. Customers are given the option to discontinue services at any time. Additionally a user name and password may be shared with partner sites for the purpose of logging a customer in to an GamePro.com service hosted in another domain. If desired, customers may choose to exclude the sharing of this information during the registration process, or by modifying their profile and service selections. 

**Site Security**  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. These hardened security systems include firewalls, authenticated access to internal databases, and audit of regular procedures. 

**Choice/Opt-Out**  
GamePro.com gives visitors the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us, at the point we request information from you. To remove personal information from our database users can send an email to [lists](https://web.archive.org/email_submission_form.cfm?address=lists). 

**Correct/Update**  
To change or modify information previously provided, users can send an email to [updatelists](https://web.archive.org/email_submission_form.cfm?address=updatelists).
