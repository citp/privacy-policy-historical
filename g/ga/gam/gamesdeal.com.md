III. General information about data processing

1\. Extent of processing of personal data  
We only collect and use personal data of our users insofar as this is necessary to provide a functional website as well as our contents and services. The collection and use of personal data of our users takes place regularly only with the user's consent. An exception applies in those cases in which prior consent cannot be obtained for real reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by legal regulations. 

2\. Legal basis for the processing of personal data  
Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 lit. a) EU General Data Protection Regulation (EUDATAP) serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data.  
In the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Article 6 (1) lit. b) EUDATAP shall serve as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.  
Insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 (1) lit. c EUDATAP serves as the legal basis.  
If processing is necessary to maintain a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the former interest, Art. 6 (1) lit. f EUDATAP serves as the legal basis for processing. 

3\. Data erasure and storage duration  
The personal data of the person concerned will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage is eliminated. In addition, such storage may take place if provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other regulations to which the controller is subject. Blocking or deletion of the data also takes place when a storage period prescribed by the standards mentioned expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for conclusion of a contract or fulfillment of the contract. 

IV. Provision of the website and creation of log files

1\. Description and scope of data processing  
Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the calling computer.

(4) The IP address of the user  
(5) Date and time of access  
(6) Websites from which the user's system reaches our website

The data is also stored in the log files of our system. A storage of this data together with other personal data of the user does not take place. 

2\. Legal basis for data processing  
The legal basis for the storage of data and logfiles is Art. 6 (1) lit. f) EUDATAP. 

3\. Purpose of data processing  
The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable the website to be delivered to the user's computer. For this the IP address of the user must remain saved for the duration of the session.  
The data is stored in logfiles to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, the data serves us to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.  
Our legitimate interest in data processing according to Art. 6 (1) lit. f) EUDATAP also lies in these purposes. 

4\. Duration of data storage  
The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. In the case of the collection of data for the provision of the website, this is the case when the respective session has ended.  
If the data is stored in logfiles, this is the case after seven days at the latest. A further saving is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the users are deleted or alienated, so that an assignment of the calling client is no longer possible. 

5\. Possibility of opposition and removal The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the website. There is consequently no contradiction on the part of the user.
