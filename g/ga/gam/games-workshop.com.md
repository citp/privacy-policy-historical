## GAMES WORKSHOP'S ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY 

Games Workshop (GW) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of all visitors to our web site. By using this site, you signify your assent to GW's Online Privacy Policy (described below), so if you do not agree then DO NOT send us any personally identifiable information. Also, please check back from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes in our privacy practices. Your continued use of our site will signify your acceptance of these changes.

GW does not require that visitors reveal any personally identifying information in order to access our main web site, though some information is required to participate in certain activities, including:

  * Responding to online surveys or polls
  * Purchasing items from the shop (including credit card info)
  * Participating in online contests or other promotions
  * Sending us questions or comments, which may require personal information for a response
  * Joining a mailing list, message board, participating in a chat session
  * Registering to play the MUD or other online games
  * Registering a web site in the community area



Where appropriate, the option to allow us to share certain information with some of our promotional partners may also be provided. No information will be shared with outside parties if you select the box indicating that you do not want this to happen. 

GW encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and take an active role to protect the privacy of their children. Parents and guardians should instruct their children never to give out real names, telephone numbers, addresses, or any other identifying information over the Internet without first getting their permission. 

No information should be submitted or posted to any GW web site by visitors under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. If you are under 13 and you want to access some of the activities on the site (message boards, chat areas, the MUD, etc) which require registration, then you will need to complete and return a consent form (see the Parental Consent Form below).

Cookies are small pieces of electronic information which a web site can store on a visitor's hard drive to track your movement within a web-site. This allows us to "personalize" the site to match your individual preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many major web sites use them.

We never store personally identifiable information in a cookie. You can choose to set your browser to notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you the option to decide whether or not to accept a cookie. However, it is worth noting that you will find some areas, in particular our online store, will not function properly if you do not instruct your computer to accept cookies. 

GW's web sites carry a number of links to other sites operated by individuals and companies over which GW has no control. Be aware that these other sites may send their own cookies, request personal information, and perform other privacy-related actions that are beyond GW's control.

We will only collect personally identifiable information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, and we will maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of the information you have provided.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online (e.g., on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas), that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information in online areas that are accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

GW will remove any information provided online by people of any age upon the request of that person or their parent or guardian. If for any reason you are concerned that the personal information maintained by Games Workshop is not correct, or you wish to have your name removed from our records, please contact us at [Techpriest@Games-Workshop.com](mailto:Techpriest@Games-Workshop.com) and we will happily review, update, or remove information as appropriate.

Then have one of your parents or your legal guardian sign the form where it says "parent signature" and fax it to **410-590-1444** in North America and South America or mail it to Games Workshop at the address below. After we receive your form that has been signed by your parent or legal guardian, we will activate your account.
