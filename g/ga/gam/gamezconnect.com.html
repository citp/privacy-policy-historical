<br>KIDS AND PARENTS
<br>

<br>This Website is not intended for use by children under age
13. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information or use
our public discussion areas, games, forums and chats. Minors between the ages
of 13 and 17 must get the permission of their parent(s) or legal guardian(s)
before making purchases, including subscriptions, on this site.
 
<br>If your children disclose information about themselves in
publicly accessible areas of the Website, they may get unsolicited messages
from other parties. Accordingly, you should tell them not to do so.
 
<br>
<br>
 
<br>THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THE WEBSITE COLLECTS
<br>
 
<br>The Website generally collects personally identifying
information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you
enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey, make a purchase, subscribe
to our publication(s), or register for any portion of our services, you are
asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name or phone number.
Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested. 
 
<br>
 
<br>HOW THE
WEBSITE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU 
 
<br>
 
<br>Service
Provider uses information you supply through the Website to provide you with
the service you have requested. For example, if you subscribe to any of our
publications, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice
and your mailing address to send you the publication. Similarly, if you
enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you
are a winner. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new
features, products or services, or to improve the services that we offer by
tailoring them to your needs.
 
<br>
 
<br>Service Provider does not sell our users' e-mail addresses.
However, unless otherwise specified, we may share e-mail addresses and sell or
share all other information with our affiliates and with carefully selected
companies who we think can offer you services and products of interest to you.
 
<br>
 
<br>We also allow access to our database by third parties that
provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or forums and job
search software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to
provide those services. And if you choose to purchase items through features on
our site, we may forward your information to third parties for services such as
credit card processing and order fulfillment. There are also times when you
provide information about yourself to us in areas of the site that are managed
or participated in by third parties, such as our auction services or shopping
areas. In such cases, the information may be used by us and by such third
party(ies), each pursuant to its own policies. We may also provide your
information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet
your needs or match your interests. While Service Provider will seek to require
such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not
authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which
it is provided, Service Provider does not bear any responsibility for any
actions or policies of third parties. There may also be occasion when we are
legally required to provide access to our database in order to cooperate with
police investigations or other legal proceedings. In those instances, the
information is provided only for that purpose.
 
<br>
 
<br>While your individual information is protected as outlined
above, we reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated,
anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as
analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.
 
<br>

information that are placed by a Website in a storage place on your own
computer. We may use cookies to control the display of ads, to track usage
patterns on the site, to deliver editorial content, and to record registration
and personalization information. For example, if you register on any part of
the Website and are given the option to save your user name and password on
your computer, we can provide this convenience to you by placing a cookie on
your computer. Our cookies may contain personally identifiable information and
such cookies may be shared with our affiliates and other companies.
 
<br>
 
<br>Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as
well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.
