To do this, you must provide an email address. This is used to email a password to you. it is also used to verify that you have not signed up for a reserved name before -- we want there to be only one reserved name per person. We do not use this email address for any other purpose. We do not resell this email address or use it to send any announcements, newsletters or advertisements. Optionally, you can provide your location from a list of counties and states. This is to allow us to show high score boards sorted by location. It is not used in conjunction with your email address for any other purpose.</p>
