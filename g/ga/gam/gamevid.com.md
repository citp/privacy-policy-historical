## Personal Information

  * Non-Account Activity.   You can watch videos on Site without having an Account
  * Account-Related Activity.  Certain other activities on Site -like posting comments or watching certain restricted videos-require you to have an Account.

  * Usage Information.  We may record information about your usage, such as when you use the Site, the channels, groups, and favourites you subscribe to, as well as information you display or click on in the Site (including UI elements, settings, and other information). If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your account.
  * Content Uploaded to Site.  Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your playback or profile pages, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others.

We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Site changes or for customer service purposes).
  * We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, click stream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Site and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.
