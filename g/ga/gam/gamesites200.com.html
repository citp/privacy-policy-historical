to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently
deleted.</li>
<li>We collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web

language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
is to better understand how our visitors use our website. From time to
time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the

<li>We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We do not use such information to
identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information,
other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
personally-identifying information.</li>
