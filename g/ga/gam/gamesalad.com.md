### Public Forums

You may choose to disclose information, including personally identifiable information, about yourself in our online forums, blogs, comments, chat rooms, games, virtual communities, message boards and user “profiles” for public view or in similar forums on the Site (collectively, “Public Forums”). Information that you disclose in any Public Forum is public information, and you agree that there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality with respect to such information.

We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in a Public Forum.

Access to Public Forums is disabled by default for education customers. Students must be over the age of 18 (or the age of 13 with consent of a parent or legal guardian) and consent of the account administrator to access the Public Forums.

### Cookies

We use “cookies” on our Site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor’s hard drive to help us improve your access to our Site and identify repeat visitors to our Site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our Site.

### Aggregate Information

The Site may track aggregated data about its users in order to determine the percentage of male and female users, the age range of users, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, IP addresses, external third party websites linked to, and other relevant data. We may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends and for statistical purposes related to consumer preferences, administer the Site, track users’ movement, target advertising and promotions and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. GameSalad may also disclose aggregate information to third parties for those third parties’ marketing purposes on the Site.

### Children’s Privacy

CHILDREN UNDER 13  
For Personal Accounts on gamesalad.com  
To ensure compliance with The Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) regulations, GameSalad recognizes the privacy interests of children, and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests. GameSalad’s services and the Site are not intended for children under the age of 13 without the consent of a parent or legal guardian. GameSalad endeavors not to collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. GameSalad designs its services and this Site to adults and not individuals under the age of 18. Personal Account Holders may utilize the service. Users under the age of 18 may do so only with the involvement of a parent or legal guardian.

For Educational Accounts on edu.gamesalad.com  
In a classroom scenario, educators can keep students’ privacy protected and still use GameSalad by creating accounts owned by the educator or institution and ensuring that students do not divulge any personally identifiable information. COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. Therefore, we only collect personal information through the Services from a child under 13 where that student’s school, district, and/or teacher has agreed (via the terms described in the following paragraph) to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services and disclose personal information to us or where the parent or legal guardian of a child has signed the child up to use the Services. If you are a student under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us if your school, district, and/or teacher has not obtained this prior consent from your parent or guardian or if your parent or guardian has not signed you up to use the Service, and please do not send any personal information other than what we request from you in connection with the Services. If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13 without parental consent being obtained by his or her parent, guardian, school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at support@gamesalad.com.

### Disclosure

We may provide your personally identifiable information that we collect and the data generated by cookies to the vendors and service providers that we may engage to assist us and to third-party partner entities that are not within the GameSalad corporate family. We will also disclose your personally identifiable information (a) if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority, (b) to enforce the Site and Services Terms of Use or to protect our rights, © to protect the safety of users of the Site and its services, or (d) to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which GameSalad participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Gendai Game’s assets to which this Site relates.

Education accounts are excluded from such communications.

### Links to Third-Party Sites

The Site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.

### Security

We may employ procedural and technological measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information such as firewalls, storing password hashes and secure socket layer. Such measures are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information and cannot assume liability for improper access to it. By using our service, including our Site and user interfaces, or providing personal information to us through any means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the services.
