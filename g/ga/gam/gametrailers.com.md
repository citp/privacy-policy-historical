Cookies and Similar Technology

On the Internet, a "cookie" is a piece of information (a file) that a Web site transfers to a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common on the Internet. The process we use to serve advertisements and to track use of Gametrailers.com involves cookies. We use cookies to recognize users who have already registered on Gametrailers.com, allowing those users to speed up their future activities on the Site. Cookies help Gametrailers.com track the frequency and placement of advertisements. Cookies also enable us to measure aggregate (total) usage and traffic to Gametrailers.com. This aids us in producing content that best meets our users' preferences. We may use that information to display advertisements that we think will be of particular interest to you. You may configure your browser to reject cookies, but this may interfere with some functionality of Gametrailers.com. Certain pages of Gametrailers.com may contain electronic images (called a "single-pixel GIF" or "web beacon") that allow a web site to count users who have visited that page. Gametrailers.com may occasionally use web beacons in order to count users and to recognize registered users by accessing the Gametrailers.com cookies. 

This Site may contain advertisements, references and links to other websites and organizations. We may also use third parties to display or serve advertising on the Site and our web-based newsletters or other communications which you may choose to receive. Often these third party advertisers employ cookie and web bug technologies to measure advertising effectiveness. You should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other websites you encounter on the Internet. The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not ours. Even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those sites or their policies and practices regarding your personal information. **This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of personal information that a third party advertiser or ad server may collect from you**. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard. Use of advertisers' tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies. For more information about these third party servers and how to "opt out" of the ad-serving cookie, please click here: <http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx>

Information Use

We use the information we gather for four general purposes:

  * To customize the advertising and content you see.
  * To enhance the user experience. We use tracking information to determine how well each page performs overall based on aggregate user demographics and traffic patterns to those pages. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.
  * To fulfill your requests for certain products and services, such as sending out electronic newsletters and enabling users to participate in polls, contests and message boards.
  * To send you information you agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to you.



Information Shared

Personally identifiable information 

We will make your personally identifiable information available to other companies or people when:

  * We have your consent to share the information
  * We have engaged companies to work with us or on our behalf to provide a product or service that you have requested, such as opt-in e-mail announcements
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process; or we believe that your actions violate applicable laws, Gametrailers.com' Terms of Use or any usage guidelines for specific products or services, or threaten the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others



Updating Personal Information

You can review, correct or change the information collected during registration by visiting your preferences page after you login. Users may change information at any time and as often as necessary.
