Definitions:

**Hosted website** : This is a website controlled by a third party but hosted by us. All hosted websites are bound by this privacy policy and any found to be violating it will be suspended, however we accept no responsibility for personal damage if such an event were to occur.

**Cookie** : A cookie is a small piece of data stored on your computer which a website sets when you visit it. Once a cookie has been set, your browser will transmit it whenever you request a page from the website that set it.

**Content management system:** Software used to manage large amounts of content on a website automatically.

**Web crawler:** An automated program which visits websites to gather information. The search engine Google uses a web crawler to automatically check millions of pages all over the internet and store their details so they can be included in search results.

**IP number (also: ip address):** Every piece of equipment connected to the internet is assigned a unique number. Your IP address is assigned to you by you ISP when you establish a connection and, in simple terms, is used by servers to locate you. When you type in a website name into your browser, your computer asks the server for that website to send the page, and leaves its IP address. This way, the server knows where to send the page to.

Cookies:

3rdlife.net uses cookies to track users of advanced features. These cookies are only used to store your login details if you choose to register at 3rdlife.net, or any forum on any hosted site. In addition to this, advertisers may also set their own cookies. A list of advertisers currently advertising on our websites follows.

Data collection policy:

Unless you choose to register, 3rdlife.net does not collect personally identifiable information about you, apart from in our server logs (explained further down). If you do register at any of our websites then we will store your details in a database. We may use email addresses to send newsletters to members ourselves (which can be opted out of), but **under no circumstances will your email address ever be transferred or sold to any third party.** Below is a list of everything we collect upon registration, and reasons we do so:

_Real name_ : This is for security purposes. Only an administrator can see what you type here

_Date of birth:_ In the interests of safety, we do not allow anybody under the age of 13 to register at any of our websites. If you enter a date of birth making you 13 or younger, the registration will be rejected (and no details stored)

_User name and password_ : These are both made up by you and do not need to be personally identifiable (feel free to make your username anything you want it to be. Other members only have to know you by this name). They are both necessary for your account to be useable.

_Email address_ : This is also for security reasons. We need people's email address not so we can send them newsletters or spam but  because it means we can identify anyone who abuses our services and identify people having multiple accounts. Only an administrator can see your email address. We have a very strict policy on the use email addresses.

All other information is entirely optional. You only need to fill in the above fields when registering.

Most 3rdlife network websites use a content management system called [3port](http://threeport.3rdlife.net/) When you register at one 3rdlife network website, this information is stored in one central database accessible to all of our websites which use 3port. Because of this, when you register at one of our websites, you login details will work at another. This is not because your details have been copied, just that both websites use the same user database

About server logs:

As you browse this web site, your IP number, country of origin, web browser and operating system are stored, along with when you visited, how long you stayed and the page you just came from. This data is transmitted by your web browser whenever you request a page. It is necessary to have this information to track down problems on the website, to trace hackers and those committing criminal activities through the web site, as well as for statistical purposes. The server logs are analyzed automatically every 24 hours to generate visitor statistics, and are read by the server administrator in order to find errors and monitor web crawlers.

We do not give or sell this information to any third party. Logs may be retained for up to 12 months. It should be noted that the logging of activity is standard on all web sites. Every server needs to keep a log containing the same or similar information.
