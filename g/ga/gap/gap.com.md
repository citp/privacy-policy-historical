### How does Gap Inc. share my information?

We may share your personal information in the following ways:

  * **Brands.** When you provide personal information to one of our Gap Inc. brands (Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Gap Factory, Banana Republic Factory, Athleta, or Intermix), we may share that information with our other Gap Inc. brands. 
  * **Direct Mail.** If you purchase Athleta brand products through our website or by placing a catalog order by phone or mail, we may share your name, postal address, and shopping history with like-minded organizations for their direct mail marketing purposes. We do not share email addresses for such purposes. We also do not share personal information about customers who only browse, email comments, request a catalog, or request email updates, or who purchase only Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Gap Factory, Banana Republic Factory, or Intermix merchandise. If you would prefer that we not share information about you with other companies, please let us know by contacting Athleta customer service as described in the section entitled, "How do I contact you?", below.
  * **By You.** You may disclose personal information when you post content to our websites, in-store technologies or other public forums, such as our brands’ social media pages, blogs, and online product reviews. Any information that you disclose through these services will become public. 
  * **Social Sharing.** Your personal information may be disclosed in connection with your social sharing activity, such as if you log into your customer account from your social media account. By connecting your customer account and your social media account, you authorize us to share information with your social media account provider, and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy. 
  * **Service Providers.** We may share your information with our service providers who manage our customer information and perform services on our behalf, such as fulfilling promotions, sending communications to our customers, conducting surveys, etc. We do not authorize any of these service providers to make any other use or disclosure of your information.

Scrip programs allow you to instruct us to divert a percentage of the amount you spend on Gap Inc. purchases to participating schools and other non-profit organizations. Loyalty programs allow you to earn "points" on purchases at Gap Inc. brands, which you may then use toward certain rewards offered by the loyalty programs in which you participate. The information you authorize us to disclose to the third-party scrip or loyalty program may include your credit card number and the date and amount of your purchase, and may also include your name and other information you have asked us to provide.

This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources.

Please note that setting the Flash Player to limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may interfere with the functionality of some Flash applications, including those used in connection with our websites and mobile apps.

We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content. You may be permitted to allow or deny such uses, but if you do deny them, we may not be able to provide you with a personalized user experience. 
  * **In-Store Technologies:** We may provide in-store technologies to help personalize and improve your shopping experience. These technologies may require the collection of certain information about your mobile device, such as your MAC address or other device identification information and may also permit you to submit personal details for increased levels of personalization, such as your interests, shopping preferences, and sizing information.

### I responded to an online job posting for a Gap Inc. job that requires me to upload personal financial information. Is this part of your hiring process?

No. Gap Inc. does not ask prospective job applicants for information about their bank accounts, credit history or passwords to financial accounts.

You can validate all Gap Inc. job postings on <http://www.gapinc.com/careers>. Spammers also create phony aliases such as thegap-usa.com to mimic our company and/or brand names in an effort to commit identity theft or other forms of fraud. If you receive this type of suspicious email activity, please alert the FBI's Internet Crimes Complaint Center: [http://www.ic3.gov](http://www.ic3.gov/)

Para entender cómo utilizamos las cookies para publicidad, vea por favor la sección "¿Cómo se utilizan mis datos personales para publicidad dirigida o basada en comportamiento y qué opciones tengo?" ,incluida más adelante.

Si no acepta las cookies, puede experimentar algunos inconvenientes en el uso de nuestros sitios web. Por ejemplo, es posible que no pueda acceder a la información de su cuenta o realizar una compra en nuestros sitios web.

  * **El uso de etiquetas de píxel y otras tecnologías similares:** Podemos utilizar etiquetas de píxel para, entre otras cosas, dar seguimiento a las acciones de los usuarios de nuestros sitios web y los servicios (incluyendo los destinatarios de correo electrónico), medir el éxito de nuestras campañas de marketing y compilar estadísticas sobre el uso de nuestros sitios y servicios y el índice de respuesta.
  * **Analytics:** Utilizamos proveedores de servicios como Google y Adobe, quienes utilizan cookies y otras tecnologías similares para recabar y analizar información sobre el uso de nuestros sitios web, aplicaciones móviles y tecnologías en tiendas. Este servicio también puede recopilar información sobre el uso de otros sitios web, aplicaciones y recursos en línea.

Si se le solicitan datos personales financieros o información de seguridad en respuesta a una solicitud de empleo, es muy probable que sea una oferta de empleo fraudulenta hecha por spammers haciéndose pasar por Gap Inc. para engañar a los solicitantes. Usted puede verificar todas las ofertas de trabajo de Gap Inc. en: <http://www.gapinc.com/careers>. Los spammers también crean alias falsos tales como thegap-usa.com para imitar a nuestra empresa y/o los nombres de nuestras marcas en un esfuerzo por cometer robo de identidad u alguna otra forma de fraude. Si usted recibe este tipo de correo electrónico sospechoso, por favor dé aviso al Centro de Quejas de Delitos por Internet (Internet Crimes Complaint Center) del FBI: [http://www.ic3.gov](http://www.ic3.gov/)
