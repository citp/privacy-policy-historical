  * **You may elect to disclose personal information.**
    * You may disclose personal information when you post content to our websites, in-store technologies or other public forums, such as our Brands’ social media pages, blogs, and online product reviews. Any information that you disclose through these services will become public.
    * Your personal information will be disclosed in connection with your social sharing activity, such as if you log into your customer account from your social media account. By connecting your customer account and your social media account, you authorise us to share information with your social media account provider, and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy.

Scrip programs allow you to instruct us to divert a percentage of the amount you spend on Gap Inc. purchases to participating schools and other non-profit organizations. Loyalty programs allow you to earn “points” or “stamps” on purchases at Gap Inc. brands, which you may then use toward certain rewards offered by the loyalty programs in which you participate.

We collect information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual, such as browser and device information; information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies, demographic information and other information provided by you; and aggregated information.

We may use and disclose such information for any lawful purpose. If required, we will treat such information as personal information in accordance with this policy. We will also treat such information as personal information to the extent it is combined with personal information. For example, when you use our technologies, we may keep a record of your product interests, the purchases you make and other content you generate (such as adding items to your shopping cart/trolley).

We may collect information in a variety of ways, including:

  * **Through your browser or device.**
    * Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Mac), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and browser click-through and usage data. We use this information to ensure that the services we offer function properly.


  * **Through our mobile applications.**
    * When you download and use one of our mobile applications, we may track and collect usage data, such as the date and time the app on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been accessed, viewed and/or downloaded to the app based on your device number or other identifier.


  * **Using cookies.**
    * Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. Our websites, online advertisements, and emails use cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies to automatically collect information about your interactions, such as browser type, pages viewed, links clicked, and other actions you take in connection with our websites, online ads, and email. We use the information for a variety of purposes, including to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalise your experience, to understand how our websites are used, to measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and for security purposes. If your browser is set to decline cookies, you may not be able to access your customer account or make a purchase on our websites. To learn how we use cookies for advertising, please see the section, "How is my information used for behavioural or targeted advertising and what choices do I have?" below.



If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. If you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our sites. For example, you may not be able to access your account information or make a purchase on our websites.

  * **Using pixel tags and** **other similar technologies.**
    * We may use pixel tags to, among other things, track the actions of users of our sites and services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of our sites and services and response rates.


  * **Analytics** : We use third-party service providers, including Google and Adobe, which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyse information about use of our websites and mobile applications and in-store technologies. These services may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. You can learn about Google’s practices at [http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/‌partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/), and opt out by using the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on, available at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>. You can learn about Adobe’s practices and opt out at <http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html>.


  * **Using Adobe Flash technology.**
    * We may use Adobe Flash technology, including Flash Local Shared Objects (“Flash LSOs”), and other similar technologies to collect and store information about your use of our websites and mobile applications. You can adjust your Flash player settings to block Flash LSO storage on your computer using the tools contained in the [Website Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html). You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the [Global Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html) and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may interfere with the functionality of some Flash applications, including those used in connection with our websites and mobile apps.


  * **IP Address.**
    * Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet service provider. An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you access our websites, along with the time of the visit and the pages that were visited. Your IP address may also indicate your approximate physical location. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other technologies. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels and diagnosing server problems. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.


  * **Physical Location.**
    * We may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or Wi-Fi signals. We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalised location-based services and content. You may be permitted to allow or deny such uses, but if you do deny them, we may not be able to provide you with a personalised user experience.


  * **In-Store Technologies.**
    * We may provide in-store technologies to help personalise and improve your shopping experience. These technologies may require the collection of certain information about your mobile device, such as your MAC address or other device identification information and may also permit you to submit personal details for increased levels of personalization, such as your interests, shopping preferences, and sizing information.


  * **Aggregated Information.**
    * We may aggregate and/or anonymise personal information so that it will no longer be considered personal information. We do so to generate other data for our use, which we may use and disclose for any purpose. For example, we may calculate the percentage of our site users who have a particular telephone area code.
