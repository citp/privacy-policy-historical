We may share your personal information in the following ways: 

  * **Brands** : When you provide personal information to one of our Brands, we may share that information with our other Brands. 
  * **By You.** You may disclose personal information when you post content to our websites, in-store technologies or other public forums, such as our brands’ social media pages, blogs, and online product reviews. Any information that you disclose through these services will become public. 
  * **Social Sharing.** Your personal information may be disclosed in connection with your social sharing activity, such as if you log into your customer account from your social media account. By connecting your customer account and your social media account, you authorise us to share information with your social media account provider, and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy. 
  * **Service Providers** **:** We may share your information with our service providers who manage our customer information and perform services on our behalf, such as fulfilling promotions, sending communications to our customers, conducting surveys, etc. We do not authorize any of these service providers to make any other use or disclosure of your information.

You can choose to disconnect from the Gap Wi-Fi network at any time through your device’s Wi-Fi settings.

These technologies and the information collected about you may also be used to track your activity across multiple devices.

**What if I apply for a Gap Inc. branded credit card on your site?**

In certain eligible countries, we may provide you with opportunities to apply for an offer of credit from a payment card issuer in our stores or online. To create a more convenient application process, we may provide information from your customer account to a payment card issuer in order to generate a pre-approved credit offer and/or populate your online credit card application with information from your customer account. By submitting a credit card application either in store or online, you acknowledge and agree that Gap Inc. may provide your information to the payment card issuer in accordance with the terms and conditions of the application. For more information about the privacy practices associated with your credit card application, please contact the payment card issuer. 

**What if I participate in local store programs?**

We may provide special opportunities for customers in certain stores or locations to receive personalized shopping or other services, such as notification when your favourite products will be in your local store, product recommendations, unique offers for certain community members such as teachers or fitness instructors, and invitations to special local events. 

In order to provide these personalized services, a sales associate may ask for information about your interests, activities, shopping preferences and other people for whom you are shopping. We may also keep records of your sizing preferences, product wish lists, local store transaction history, and contact information. We may use your information to contact you by phone or text message, in accordance with this policy.

"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an email that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through email. 

back to top

**I received a suspicious email from a Gap Inc brand regarding an order I did not place. What should I do?**

We are aware of phony emails sent out under our Brand names. These emails did not originate from Gap Inc., and individuals who received fraudulent order status emails have not been charged. For your protection, do not click links or open any files attached to suspicious, unsolicited emails. If you believe your personal computer has been compromised as a result of a scam, please consult an IT professional. For more information, contact Action Fraud, the National Fraud and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre at <http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/>. We work with law enforcement on their investigations of these kinds of fraudulent emails.

**I responded to an online job posting for a Gap Inc. job that requires me to upload personal financial information. Is this part of your hiring process?**

No. Gap Inc. does not ask prospective job applicants for information about their bank accounts, credit history or passwords to financial accounts. If you are asked for personal financial or security information in response to a job application, this is likely a fraudulent job listing hosted by spammers to mislead job applicants. You can validate all Gap Inc. job postings on [https://jobs.gapinc.com](https://jobs.gapinc.com/) . Spammers also create phony aliases such as the-gap.co.uk to mimic our company and/or Brand names in an effort to commit identity theft or other forms of fraud. If you receive this type of suspicious email activity, please alert Action Fraud, the National Fraud and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre at <http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/>.

Indem Sie Ihr Kundenkonto und Ihr Konto bei einem sozialen Netzwerk verknüpfen, erlauben Sie uns, Informationen mit dem Betreiber des entsprechenden sozialen Netzwerks zu teilen, und Sie verstehen, dass die Nutzung der von uns geteilten Informationen durch die Datenschutzrichtlinie des sozialen Netzwerks geregelt wird. 
  * **Dienstleister:** Wir teilen Ihre Informationen unter Umständen mit unseren Dienstleistern, die unsere Kundeninformationen verwalten und Dienstleistungen in unserem Namen erbringen, so etwa Werbeaktionen vornehmen, Mitteilungen an unsere Kunden senden, Umfragen durchführen, etc. Wir ermächtigen keinen dieser Dienstleister dazu, Ihre Informationen anderweitig zu nutzen oder offenzulegen.

**Welche sonstigen Informationen erhebt Gap Inc.?**

Wir können Informationen erfassen, die Ihre spezifische Identität nicht preisgeben bzw. die sich nicht direkt auf eine Einzelperson beziehen, wie etwa Browser- und Geräteinformationen; Informationen, die über Cookies, Pixel-Tags und sonstige Technologien gesammelt werden, demografische Informationen und sonstige Informationen, die Sie zur Verfügung stellen; sowie auch zusammengeführte Daten. 

Wir sind berechtigt, solche Informationen für jedweden rechtmäßigen Zweck zu nutzen und offenzulegen. Bei Bedarf werden wir solche Informationen als personenbezogene Informationen gemäß dieser Richtlinie behandeln. Wir werden solche Informationen ebenfalls als personenbezogene Informationen behandeln, soweit sie mit personenbezogenen Informationen kombiniert sind. Beispielsweise sind wir berechtigt, wenn Sie unsere Technologien verwenden, Informationen zu Ihren Produktvorlieben, den Einkäufen, die Sie tätigen, und anderen Inhalten, die Sie generieren (etwa wenn Sie Ihrem Einkaufswagen Gegenstände hinzufügen), aufzubewahren. 

Wir können Informationen auf verschiedene Art erfassen, darunter: 

  * **Ihr Browser oder Gerät:** Bestimmte Informationen werden von den meisten Browsern gesammelt oder automatisch durch Ihr Gerät erfasst, wie etwa Ihre MAC-Adresse, Ihr Computertyp (Windows oder Macintosh), Bildschirmauflösung, Name und Version Ihres Betriebssystems, Gerätehersteller und -modell, Sprache, Art und Version des Internetbrowsers, sowie Browserverlauf und Nutzungsdaten. 
  * **Mobile Applikationen:** Wenn Sie eine unserer mobilen Applikationen herunterladen und nutzen, verfolgen und erfassen wir gegebenenfalls Ihre Nutzungsdaten, wie etwa, basierend auf Ihrer Gerätenummer oder einer sonstigen Kennung, das Datum und die Uhrzeit, wann die App von Ihrem Gerät auf unsere Server zugreift, und welche Informationen und Dateien abgerufen, angesehen und/oder in die App heruntergeladen worden sind. 
  * **Cookies:** Cookies sind kleine Informationseinheiten, die direkt auf dem Computer gespeichert werden, den Sie nutzen. Unsere Websites, Online-Werbeanzeigen und E-Mails nutzen Cookies, Pixel-Tags und sonstige Technologien, um automatisch Informationen über Ihre Interaktionen zu sammeln, wie etwa die Art des Browsers, die aufgerufenen Seiten, die angeklickten Links und sonstige Aktionen, die Sie im Zusammenhang mit unseren Websites, Online-Werbeanzeigen und E-Mails vornehmen. Wir nutzen die Informationen für verschiedene Zwecke, unter anderem, um die Navigation zu erleichtern, Informationen effektiver darzustellen, Ihr Erlebnis individuell zu gestalten, zu verstehen, wie unsere Websites genutzt werden, den Erfolg unserer Marketingkampagnen zu bestimmen, und für Sicherheitszwecke. Sollte Ihr Browser so eingestellt sein, dass Cookies abgelehnt werden, können Sie unter Umständen Ihr Kundenkonto nicht aufrufen oder keine Käufe auf unseren Websites tätigen. Um mehr darüber zu erfahren, wie wir Cookies zu Werbezecken einsetzen, gehen Sie bitte zum untenstehenden Abschnitt  „Wie werden meine Informationen für verhaltensbasierte oder zielgerichtete Werbung verwendet und wie kann ich dies beeinflussen?“  . 



Sollten Sie nicht wünschen, dass Informationen durch den Einsatz von Cookies erfasst werden, stehen in den meisten Browsern einfache Maßnahmen zur Verfügung, um Cookies automatisch abzulehnen oder vor die Wahl gestellt zu werden, den Transfer eines bestimmten Cookies (oder mehrerer Cookies) von einer bestimmten Seite auf Ihren Computer abzulehnen oder zuzulassen. Wenn Sie keine Cookies zulassen, kann dies gewisse Unannehmlichkeiten bei der Nutzung unserer Websites zur Folge haben. Beispielsweise können Sie unter Umständen Ihre Kontoinformationen nicht aufrufen oder keine Käufe auf unseren Websites tätigen. 

  * **Einsatz von Pixel-Tags und sonstigen ähnlichen Technologien:** Wir verwenden möglicherweise Pixel-Tags, um, unter anderem, die Aktionen der Nutzer unserer Websites und Dienstleistungen (einschließlich E-Mail-Empfänger) nachzuverfolgen, den Erfolg unserer Marketingkampagnen zu bestimmen und Statistiken über die Nutzung unserer Websites und Dienstleistungen sowie zu Antwortquoten zu erstellen. 
  * **Analyse:** Wir nutzen Drittanbieter, darunter Google und Adobe, die Cookies und ähnliche Technologien verwenden, um Informationen über die Nutzung unserer Websites, unserer mobilen Applikationen und unserer Technologien in den Geschäften zu sammeln und zu analysieren. Diese Dienstleistung beinhaltet unter Umständen auch die Erfassung von Informationen hinsichtlich der Nutzung anderer Websites, Applikationen und Online-Ressourcen. Um mehr über die Praktiken von Google zu erfahren, besuchen Sie bitte [ http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/‌partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/) , und um die Erfassung dieser Informationen zu untersagen, nutzen Sie das Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on, verfügbar unter [ https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) .

  * **Adobe Flash** : Wir nutzen unter Umständen Adobe Flash-Technologie, unter anderem Flash Local Shared Objects („Flash LSOs“) und sonstige ähnliche Technologien, um Informationen über Ihre Nutzung unserer Websites und mobilen Applikationen zu sammeln und zu speichern. Sie können Ihren Flash Player so einstellen, dass die Speicherung von Flash LSOs auf Ihrem Computer blockiert wird, indem Sie die Tools im [Bedienfeld Website-Speichereinstellungen ](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html) nutzen. Sie können Flash LSOs auch steuern, indem Sie in das [Bedienfeld Globale Speichereinstellungen](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html) gehen und die Anweisungen befolgen (darunter finden sich ggf. Anweisungen, die beispielsweise erklären, wie Sie vorhandene Flash LSOs (auf der Macromedia-Seite „Informationen“ genannt) löschen, wie Sie der ungefragten Platzierung von Flash LSOs entgegenwirken, und (bei Flash Player 8 und späteren Versionen) wie Sie Flash LSOs blockieren, die nicht vom Betreiber der Seite stammen, auf der Sie gerade sind). Bitte beachten Sie, wenn Sie den Flash Player so einstellen, dass die Zulassung von Flash LSOs eingeschränkt ist, dass dies Auswirkungen auf die Funktionalität einiger Flash-Applikationen haben kann, unter anderem solcher Applikationen, die im Zusammenhang mit unseren Websites und mobilen Apps Anwendung finden. 
  * **IP-Adresse:** Ihre Internetprotokolladresse (IP-Adresse) ist eine Nummer, die dem von Ihnen genutzten Computer automatisch von Ihrem Internet Service Provider (ISP) erteilt wird. Die IP-Adresse wird ggf. neben der Dauer Ihres Besuchs und den aufgerufenen Seiten automatisch in unseren Server-Protokolldateien ausgewiesen und vermerkt, wenn Sie unsere Websites besuchen. Ihre IP-Adresse weist ggf. auch auf Ihren ungefähren physischen Standort hin. Die Erfassung von IP-Adressen ist ein Standardverfahren und erfolgt auf vielen Websites, in Applikationen und sonstigen Technologien automatisch. Wir nutzen IP-Adressen zu solchen Zwecken wie der Berechnung von Nutzerquoten und der Diagnose von Serverproblemen. 
  * **Physischer Standort:** Wir erfassen ggf. den physischen Standort Ihres Geräts, indem wir beispielsweise Satelliten-, Mobilfunkmast- oder WLAN-Signale nutzen. Wir nutzen den physischen Standort Ihres Geräts unter Umständen, um Sie mit individuell angepassten ortsbasierten Dienstleistungen und Inhalten zu versorgen. Es ist Ihnen gestattet, eine solche Nutzung zu erlauben oder diese abzulehnen. Im Falle einer Ablehnung werden wir jedoch unter Umständen nicht in der Lage sein, Ihnen ein individuell angepasstes Benutzererlebnis zu bieten. ****
  * **Technologien in den Geschäften:** Wir bieten ggf. Technologien in den Geschäften, die dazu beitragen, Ihr Einkaufserlebnis individuell anzupassen und zu verbessern. Diese Technologien erfordern unter Umständen eine Erhebung bestimmter Informationen über Ihr mobiles Gerät, wie etwa Ihre MAC-Adresse oder andere Daten zur Gerätekennung, und gestatten es Ihnen außerdem, personenbezogene Daten zum Zwecke einer besseren individuellen Anpassung zu übermitteln, etwa zu Ihren Interessen, Ihren Einkaufsvorlieben und Informationen zu Ihrer Größe. 
  * **Zusammengeführte Informationen:** Wir erfassen und nutzen ggf. zusammengeführte personenbezogene Informationen, die nicht Ihre Identität erkennen lassen. Beispielsweise berechnen wir unter Umständen den Prozentsatz an Nutzern unserer Website, die eine bestimmte Telefonvorwahl haben.

**Was passiert, wenn ich mich mit dem in Geschäften von Gap Inc. angebotenen WLAN-Netz verbinde?**

Wenn Sie sich mit dem in unseren Geschäften angebotenen WLAN-Netz verbinden, werden die Gap Unternehmen Informationen über Sie und Ihr Gerät erhalten, unter anderem die MAC-Adresse Ihres Geräts, die IP-Adresse, den RSSI-Indikator und technische Daten zu Ihrem Gerät, wie etwa dessen Betriebssystem und Gerätetyp (darunter Hersteller und Modell) und technische Fähigkeiten. Sollten Sie Ihrem Gerät einen Namen zugewiesen haben, können wir diesen erhalten. Außerdem werden wir Informationen darüber erhalten, wie Sie unser WLAN-Netz nutzen, während Sie damit verbunden sind, unter anderem den Standort des Geschäfts, die Bereiche innerhalb des Geschäfts, die Sie aufsuchen, die Namen und/oder Internetadressen der Websites, die Sie besuchen, und die Applikationen, die Sie nutzen, und auch darüber, wie lange Sie mit solchen Websites oder Applikationen interagieren. Wir erheben diese Informationen jedes Mal, wenn Sie sich mit dem WLAN-Netz verbinden, und bringen diese unter Umständen in Verbindung mit anderen Informationen, die wir von Ihnen eingeholt und über Sie gesammelt haben. 

Sollte Ihr mobiles Gerät so konfiguriert sein, dass es nach verfügbaren WLAN-Netzen sucht, erhalten wir ggf. Informationen über Ihr Gerät, selbst wenn Sie sich nicht dazu entschließen, sich mit unserem WLAN-Netz zu verbinden. 

Als Annehmlichkeit können wir Ihnen die Möglichkeit anbieten, mit dem WLAN-Netz der Gap Unternehmen verbunden zu bleiben. Sollten Sie sich dafür entscheiden, werden Sie automatisch in das WLAN-Netz eines jeden Gap Unternehmens eingeloggt, das ein solches anbietet, und wir können die oben beschriebenen Informationen erfassen, selbst wenn Sie während Ihres Aufenthalts in unserem Geschäft nicht aktiv Ihren Internetbrowser oder Ihre mobilen Applikationen nutzen. Sie können jederzeit über die WLAN-Einstellungen Ihres Geräts die Verbindung zum Gap-WLAN-Netz unterbrechen. Doch beachten Sie bitte, dass die Unterbrechung der Verbindung zum WLAN-Netz eines Geschäfts Sie nur während Ihres aktuellen Aufenthalts von diesem Netz trennt. Sie können sich jederzeit gegen die automatische Verbindungsherstellung entscheiden, indem Sie [http://www.smart-places.org](http://www.smart-places.org/) besuchen. 

Um umfassende Einzelheiten zu den WLAN-Praktiken in unseren Geschäften zu erhalten, lesen Sie bitte unsere [ WLAN-Nutzungsbedingungen. ](https://secure-www.gap.com/customerwifi/splash?base_grant_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure-www.gap.com%2Fcustomerwifi%2FmerakiTestDouble&node_mac=00:18:0a:da:4e:f0&client_mac=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx)

**Was passiert, wenn ich unterschiedliche Geräte verwende, um die Websites oder mobilen Applikationen von Gap Inc. aufzurufen?** ****

Um Ihnen ein effizienteres und angenehmeres Einkaufserlebnis zu bieten, wird es Ihnen ermöglicht, auf unterschiedliche Inhalte zuzugreifen oder sich von vielen verschiedenen Geräten aus in Ihr Konto einzuloggen. Sollten Sie viele verschiedene Geräte nutzen, um unsere Websites oder mobilen Applikationen zu nutzen, wie etwa Ihren Heimcomputer, Laptop und/oder mobile Geräte, können wir unter Umständen jedes dieser Geräte mit Ihrem Konto verknüpfen. Beispielsweise werden unsere Websites es Ihnen gestatten, Ihre bevorzugten Artikel oder Ihren Einkaufswagen über einen E-Mail-Link, der einzig Ihrem Konto zugewiesen ist, aufzurufen. Wenn Sie auf den Link klicken, werden Sie automatisch in Ihr Konto eingeloggt, so dass Sie Ihren Einkauf dort fortsetzen können, wo Sie ihn unterbrochen haben. Wenn Sie diesem E-Mail-Link nun auf einem neuen Gerät folgen, können wir Ihr aktuelles Gerät mit Ihren Kontoinformationen verknüpfen. Die Informationen, die wir von Ihren unterschiedlichen Geräten gesammelt haben, können mit anderen Informationen kombiniert werden, die Sie uns zur Verfügung gestellt haben, auch mit Informationen, die in Ihrem Kundenkonto gespeichert sind. Wir sind berechtigt, solche Informationen zu nutzen, um, wie in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie dargelegt, ein besser auf Sie zugeschnittenes Erlebnis sowie konsequente Dienstleistungen und Erlebnisse auf all Ihren Geräten zu bieten. Sie haben die Wahl, unsere Website zu besuchen, ohne dass Ihr Gerät erkannt wird, indem Sie sich aus Ihrem Konto ausloggen. ****

**Was passiert, wenn ich an Programmen lokaler Geschäfte teilnehme?** ****

Wir bieten ggf. in bestimmten Geschäften oder an bestimmten Standorten besondere Gelegenheiten für Kunden, individuell angepasste Einkaufs- oder sonstige Dienstleistungen zu beziehen, etwa eine Mitteilung, wenn Ihr Lieblingsprodukt in Ihrem lokalen Geschäft verfügbar ist, Produktempfehlungen, Sonderangebote für bestimmte Gemeinschaftsmitglieder, wie etwa Lehrer oder Fitnesstrainer, sowie Einladungen zu besonderen lokalen Ereignissen. 

Um diese auf Sie ausgerichteten Dienstleistungen bereitstellen zu können, wird ein Verkaufsmitarbeiter Sie unter Umständen um Informationen zu Ihren Interessen, Aktivitäten, Einkaufsvorlieben und zu anderen Personen, für die Sie einkaufen, bitten. Wir sind auch berechtigt, Aufzeichnungen zu Ihrer bevorzugten Größe, Ihren Produktwunschlisten, dem Verlauf Ihrer Transaktionen in lokalen Geschäften und Ihren Kontaktinformationen zu führen. Diese Informationen werden wir ggf. nutzen, um Sie gemäß dieser Richtlinie per Telefon oder SMS zu kontaktieren. In bestimmten Fällen können Sie auch einen Verkaufsmitarbeiter dazu ermächtigen, in Ihrem Auftrag mittels der Zahlungsdaten, die Sie zuvor im Rahmen einer online oder im Geschäft vorgenommenen Transaktion bereitgestellt haben, einen Einkauf zu tätigen.

Wir tun unser Bestes, um Ihr Einkaufserlebnis sicher und komfortabel zu gestalten. Wir haben bestimmte physische, elektronische, vertragliche und geschäftsleitende Sicherheitsvorkehrungen zum Schutz Ihrer Sicherheit und der Vertraulichkeit Ihrer personenbezogenen Informationen eingerichtet.

Unter keinen Umständen werden wir Ihr Passwort, Ihren Nutzernamen, Kreditkarteninformationen oder sonstige personenbezogene Informationen per E-Mail erfragen.

** Ich habe von einer Gap Inc.-Marke eine verdächtige E-Mail zu einer Bestellung erhalten, die ich nicht aufgegeben habe. Was soll ich tun? **

Wir wissen, dass gefälschte E-Mails unter unseren Markennamen versandt werden. Diese E-Mails stammen nicht von Gap Inc. Auch wurde Personen, die betrügerische Bestellstatus-E-Mails erhalten haben, dies nicht in Rechnung gestellt. Zu Ihrem eigenen Schutz sollten Sie nicht auf Links klicken oder Anhänge zu verdächtigen, nicht angeforderten E-Mails öffnen. Sollten Sie der Meinung sein, dass Ihr PC in Folge von Betrügerei kompromittiert wurde, ziehen Sie bitte einen IT-Experten hinzu. Wenn Sie mehr erfahren möchten, nehmen Sie bitte über [http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/ ](http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/) Kontakt mit „Action Fraud“ („Aktion Betrug“), Großbritanniens Meldestelle für Betrugsfälle und Cyberkriminalität, auf.

** Ich habe auf eine Online-Stellenausschreibung zu einer Vakanz bei Gap Inc. geantwortet und soll dazu persönliche Finanzinformationen hochladen. Ist dies Teil Ihres Einstellungsverfahrens? **

Nein. Gap Inc. erfragt von Bewerbern keine Informationen zu ihren Bankkonten, ihrer Kredithistorie oder Passwörtern zu Finanzkonten. Sollten Sie im Rahmen einer Stellenausschreibung um persönliche Finanz- oder Sicherheitsdaten gebeten werden, handelt es sich wahrscheinlich um ein betrügerisches Stellenangebot, das von Spammern eingestellt wurde, um Bewerber in die Irre zu führen. Sie können alle Stellenausschreibungen von Gap Inc. auf [https://jobs.gapinc.com](https://jobs.gapinc.com/) finden und gegenprüfen. Spammer kreieren auch gefälschte Alias, wie etwa the-gap.co.uk, um unsere Unternehmens- und/oder Markennamen in dem Bemühen nachzuahmen, Identitätsdiebstahl oder andere Formen der Betrügerei zu begehen. Wenn Sie verdächtige E-Mail-Aktivitäten dieser Art beobachten, melden Sie dies bitte „Action Fraud“ („Aktion Betrug“), Großbritanniens Meldestelle für Betrugsfälle und Cyberkriminalität, über [http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/ ](http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/) .
