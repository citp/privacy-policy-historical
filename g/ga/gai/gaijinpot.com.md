# Jobs in Japan: Advertisement - Jobs - Japan Jobs - Japan Info - Japan Apartments - Japan Classifieds - Japan Forums

**You decide whether you wish to show your details to an employer by applying to a job and if you want to have your profile searchable in our resume bank.**

If you decide to add your profile to our resume bank — which companies use to find and invite candidates — companies can only send you an email through our secure system, leaving your personal details unseen. Your name, address, telephone number, and the name of your current company remain strictly confidential. 

Here is an example of what employers will see when you apply for a specific job:

## Resume Bank: _Maximize Your Employment Chances_

**Fact:** There are always more candidates than jobs available. How can you help employers find you faster? Make your resume searchable. Remember, employers are just as proactive about finding the right candidate as you are about finding the right job. When your resume is in the resume bank employers can use keyword searches to seek you out. 

## Stay Hidden: _Lock Your Resume_

You can opt to leave your resume locked up tight. No one will be able to access your data unless you specifically apply for a job. You minimize risk, but you also minimize your opportunities. The choice is yours, and you can change your mind at any time.
