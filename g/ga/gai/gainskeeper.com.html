              <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
              <h2>This statement discloses the privacy practices of www.gainskeeper.com </h2>

<p>GainsKeeper, a part of <a href="http://www.wolterskluwerfs.com" target="_blank">Wolters Kluwer Financial Services</a>, offers a service that is founded on a trusting relationship with its customers. That is why each bit of information processed by GainsKeeper is encrypted, password protected, and stored on secure servers. GainsKeeper's host environment provides security personnel that monitor the systems 24 hours a day. Access to our servers requires multiple levels of authentication, including biometrics (hand print scan) procedures.
GainsKeeper's uses SSL encryption technology to provide a secure connection between a user's browser and GainsKeeper's servers. In addition, GainsKeeper is recognized as a "VeriSign Secure Site."  VeriSign's rigorous authentication practices undergo an extensive SAS 70 Type II audit by KPMG. The Statement of Auditing Standard 70, SAS 70, was established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to certify trusted practices. </p>

<h2>Our commitment to you</h2>

<p>Our data collection policies were created to make your online experience satisfying and safe. We allow you to determine how much information and what information you provide, and to control how that information is used. Our goal is to provide you with an accurate tax lot accounting service, while allowing you to maintain your privacy.</p>

<h2>What information is collected?</h2>

<p>GainsKeeper does not sell, trade, or rent your information to a third party without your consent or request. During registration and account setup, we ask you to submit information such as your name, email address, zip code, brokerage names and account descriptions, and the type of operating system your computer uses.  Information provided during the registration and/or subscription process will only be used internally by GainsKeeper's marketing department for demographic studies on our users and their investing and tax filing practices in order to generate statistics on our user base. However, we do not sell, trade, or rent your information to a third party without your consent or request. </p>

<h2>How is the information used?</h2>

<p>GainsKeeper uses the information you enter to provide its tax lot accounting service, such as custom Capital Gain/Loss and Schedule D reports with the user name and address in the report header for proper tax filing. We also use the information to do research on demographics, interests, and behavior. Our research is done to better understand and serve our users. For example, GainsKeeper uses investment information to determine what type of trading activity the majority of our users undertake. In general, if our users are trading more mutual funds than stocks we can target future development efforts on services focused on mutual fund analysis. A past study of this kind indicated that a large portion of our users required option functionality, and we made development plans accordingly to now offer this. This information and analysis is compiled only on an aggregated basis for general statistics. </p>

<p>There are opportunities where individuals can opt-in to receive a premium service from GainsKeeper or its partners. An example of opt-in premium services are if GainsKeeper partners with a brokerage or an advisory company to provide GainsKeeper members with services, such as automatic data downloads. GainsKeeper members will opt-in to elect this type of premium service before any of your information is shared.</p>

<h2>What kinds of security procedures are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under the company's control?</h2>

<p>GainsKeeper operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our systems are hosted with <a href="http://www.savvis.net" target="_blank">SAVVIS Communications</a>, using state of the art security and redundancy. SAVVIS delivers IP VPNs, managed hosting and Internet services to enterprises around the world through an IP infrastructure spanning 45 countries. GainsKeeper generates bi-daily backups of all user data in protection of system failures. Every time you send or request a web page from GainsKeeper's servers, we encrypt the page using SSL technology and a digital certificate provided by a third party, VeriSign, Inc. This includes encryption of any credit card or billing information entered into the site. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. However, information submitted under this privacy notice will never be used in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prevent that use. Only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers. You the consumer are ultimately responsible for the access to GainsKeeper via protection of your GainsKeeper Login ID and password.</p>

<h2>Can you prohibit GainsKeeper from sending any email to you?</h2>

<p>GainsKeeper reserves the right to send infrequent Service Alert messages to its customers to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of our Terms of Service. GainsKeeper is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters which will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications is rare. </p>

<h2>How to contact us?</h2>

<p>Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please email us at
