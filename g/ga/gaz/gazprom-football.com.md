 **2.** **Processing of personal data and purposes of processing** **a.**

 **a. When visiting the website**

You can visit our website without disclosing information regarding your identity. In the context of any access to our website, however, it is essential that certain personal data are stored on the server of our provider in order to enable the connection to the website. This includes information such as:

\- Your client IP address,  
\- the name and the URL of the file that has been requested,  
\- the website from which access has been made,  
\- the name and the description of the internet browser you have used,  
\- the date and time of each access  
\- the amount of data transmitted.

The information is stored in a so called log file on the server of our website and is automatically deleted there after 4 weeks.

The IP address is processed for technical and administrative purposes of connection establishment and connection stability in order to ensure the security and functionality of our website and to be able to track any illegal attacks if necessary.

The information shall also be used to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage for the purpose of market research and needs based website design.

The legal basis for processing the IP address and other information from the log file is Article 6 para.1 S.1 lit. f of the GDPR. Our legitimate interest arises from the security interest mentioned and the need for a trouble free and user friendly provision of our website. From the processing of the IP address and other information in the log file, we can not draw any direct conclusions about your identity.

Only authorised personnel who are responsible for the management of the servers are authorised to access the data. As no personal assignment takes place, the data records for the statistical evaluation are kept in anonymous form by deleting the last digit sequence of the IP address.

Specific personal data, such as email addresses, first name, name, telephone number or address, are requested for separate services and activities. A request for personal data will be applicable especially when you register to access our website, when you request to use a special service and when you take part in a prize competition. This information is collected entirely on a voluntary basis. This information shall also be treated confidentially and shall not be passed on to any third parties.

Online offers provided by our cooperating partners that are integrated into our website and which are referenced as such are excluded from the provisions stipulated in the preceding paragraph. These online offers are governed by separate technical and legal conditions. Please refer to the relevant information provided by our cooperating partners.

On the instructions of competent government authorities, we or our cooperating partners could be obligated in individual cases to hand over personal data if this is required to prevent danger, to provide protection against threats, for public prosecution purposes or for any other reasons regulated by law.

Otherwise, no collection, processing or use of your personal data shall take place, unless the following information indicates otherwise (see, for example, web analysis, remarketing or social networks).

The specification of a telephone number is voluntary. If you do not specify this, you will not incur any disadvantages. However, providing a telephone number makes it easier for us to contact you if you have any questions.

These data is collected to identify you as a user and to give you access to your own user account. The username and a password of your choice are also valid as access data to your user account by means of which you can also log in later. By means of your user account you can use the exclusive functions and offers of the website after successful registration.

\- for possibly necessary contact with you for inquiries.

After your registration, you will receive a registration message via email, which you must confirm to verify your email address. This serves as proof that the registration was actually initiated by you.

The processing of the data provided during the registration takes place at your request and is pursuant to Article 6 para. 1 S. 1 lit. b of the GDPR for the aforementioned purposes for the use of exclusive functions and offers and thus for the performance of the contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract.

In this context, a pixel ID is created and stored in a cookie so that we are able to analyse your user behaviour until the tracking pixel expires. The tracking pixel is not for personal identification purposes.
