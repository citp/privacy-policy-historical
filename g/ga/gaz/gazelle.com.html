  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Gazelle takes your privacy seriously, and we have designed and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy, the types of personal information we gather when you use Gazelle services, and the steps we take to safeguard it.</p>
<p>This policy covers how Gazelle treats personal information that Gazelle collects and receives for our services on the Gazelle websites. It applies generally to the gazelle.com website and content and other related websites where this policy appears in the footer of the page. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, physical address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.</p>
<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>You can browse gazelle.com without telling Gazelle who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. However, when you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, and zip code; once you register with Gazelle and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information.</p>
<p>Gazelle collects personal and non-personal information when you use Gazelle products or services, transactional information when you sell, ship, or purchase an item, when you register with Gazelle, when you visit Gazelle pages or the pages of certain Gazelle partners, when you provide information we may ask you for to authenticate yourself, when you complete a survey, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. Gazelle might also receive information about you from other sources and add it to your account information.</p>
<p>Gazelle automatically receives and records non-personal information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, browser type, browser language, date and time of your query, Gazelle cookie information, and the page you request.</p>
<p>Gazelle uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, conduct research, contact you under certain circumstances, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. <br>
Gazelle will use your email address to contact you under the following circumstances: to respond to your support questions, to notify you of material changes to our policies or website, to request your participation in user surveys, and to deliver products, services and marketing communications that you request.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Gazelle may set and access Gazelle cookies on your computer. Upon your first visit to Gazelle, a cookie is sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer and stored on your hard drive when you visit a website. Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however if you reject cookies, you will not be able to sign in to Gazelle or take full advantage of our services.</p>
<p>Gazelle uses cookies for the following general purposes: to track your preferences, such as the address or local zip code you enter; to access your information when you sign in so we can provide you with your personalized content, to display the most appropriate advertisements, based on your interests and activity on our web site; and to help us estimate our traffic. Gazelle may use other companies to show advertisements on some of our pages. These other companies set and access their own cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Gazelle's cookies.</p>
<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p>Gazelle does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Gazelle under confidentiality agreements. These trusted partners include companies with which Gazelle may operate co-branded websites or web-pages to expand their services using Gazelle. These trusted partners may use your personal information to provide services to you on our behalf, evaluate the effectiveness of the services, and to help Gazelle communicate with you about offers from Gazelle and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.</p>
<p>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
<p>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Gazelle's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>We transfer information about you if Gazelle is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Gazelle will post a notice on its website before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p>Gazelle displays targeted advertisements based on personal information, including zip code and profile. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, men ages 25-34 from a particular geographic area. Gazelle does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>The sites displayed as search results or linked to by Gazelle's services are developed by people over whom Gazelle exercises no control. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information.</p>
<p>Gazelle may present links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed. We use this information to understand and improve the quality of Gazelle's search technology. For instance, this data helps us determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results.</p>
<h2>Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences</h2>
<p>Registered Users can edit their Gazelle Account Information, including contact preferences, at any time from their "My Account" account management page.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to Gazelle services, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Gazelle Newsletter, that are considered part of your Gazelle account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.</p>
<p>You can delete your Gazelle registered account by requesting an account deletion via email to support@gazelle.com. You must provide us with the email address of the registered account. After we have confirmed your request via email, we will remove access to your personal information from our user database.</p>
<h2>Confidentiality and Security</h2>
<p>We limit access to personal information about you to our employees and agents who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</p>
<p>Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use many tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we request that you not send private information to us by email or instant messaging services.</p>
<h2>Third Parties</h2>
<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Gazelle does not own or control or to people that Gazelle does not employ or manage. Gazelle's website may include applications, content and/or ads from third parties that may perform user activity tracking in addition to that described herein; Gazelle accepts no responsibility for said activities. Gazelle does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others. For more information about each such third party, please refer to the third party's privacy policy.</p>
<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted on the site, unless that amendment states otherwise. In addition, we will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Gazelle account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.</p>
<p>If you have questions, concerns or suggestions, please feel free to send an email to privacy@gazelle.com.</p>
