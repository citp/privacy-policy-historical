 **PRIVACY POLICY**

We believe you have a right to know what personal information is collected during your visits to Bliss sites and how the information is used and safeguarded. You can view some of our content anonymously, but circumstances exist when information about you is collected. The information gathered falls into two categories: information you supply voluntarily and information we gather through technology.

 **Information you supply voluntarily**

To use certain features and services on Bliss sites, you may be asked to provide specific information about yourself. This information is collected when you fill out a browser-based form and is necessary to make the features useful and valuable. The forms have blank spaces into which you type the information. We collect information, including but not limited, your name, email address, telephone number, birth date and mailing address.

 **How we use information you supply voluntarily**

We use the information you voluntarily supply to develop and offer content that best suits your interests, to complete transactions, or to communicate with you. For example, if you purchase a print subscription, we use your information to process your order. If you contact us for help, we use the information to contact you with a resolution to your problem or answer to your question. If you enter a contest, we use the information to determine eligibility and to contact winners.

 **Information gathered through technology**

Technology helps us gather other information. Our web servers automatically collect information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, which is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet. You likely enter the Internet through your Internet service provider, your company or your school. Your IP address does not identify you personally. Your email address is not collected through this process, and no data on your hard drive or personal or institutional servers are read.

We also collect aggregate information on how many people visit our sites and what pages people access on our sites. Some of this information is gathered using a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie." A cookie cannot read data on your hard drive or server or gather other personal information about you such as your name or email address. Aggregate information is processed by third party services: Omniture and Google Analytics.

 **How we use information gathered through technology**

The information gathered through technology helps us make our sites more interesting and useful to you and other visitors. It helps us evaluate the value of and interest in specific sections of our sites. We can build better sites if we know which content you and other people visit and how often you and others visit that content. In turn, we are able to deliver content most suited to an individual's preferences. Site content includes, but is not limited to, news and information content and advertising.

 **Sharing information with other parties**

Personal information you voluntarily provide is used for internal purposes only and is not shared with or sold to other businesses or organizations. Use of certain interactive features, such as commenting on a news article, implies your permission to share your information. Situations where permission is implied are clearly labeled on the browser-based forms. We will share personal information with law enforcement officials as required under subpoena or court order to protect the safety and security of our sites, our visitors and the community. We do share aggregated statistics on site visits and page views with advertisers, as well as audience profiles. This to helps them understand and target certain audiences and confirm the value of advertising on our web sites. Personal information about individuals is not shared with advertisers.

 **Special notice about children**

Children should always get parental permission before sending any information about themselves over the Internet -- to us or anyone else. We encourage parents to review and share safety tips with their children using the Internet. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe we have any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us.

The Gazette, Bliss Communications, Inc., and Bliss New Media are affiliated with other online companies and providers, some of which feature our branding. Our web sites also provide text and graphic links to web sites over which we have no control or responsibility for content or business practices. This policy statement does not apply to the web sites of those companies and organizations. Please refer to these affiliated sites to obtain information on their privacy policies. If you cannot find the privacy policy of these sites via a link from the site's home page, you should contact the business or organization directly for more information.
