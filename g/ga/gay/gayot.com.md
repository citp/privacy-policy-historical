# Gayot.com: About Us

**Gayot Privacy Policy**

Maintaining your privacy—online and off—is of utmost importance to Gayot. This policy will tell you exactly what we will and won't do with the private, personal information you provide us. Please feel free to read it in full, but here is a summary: 

  * Gayot does not share your personal information with anyone without your permission. 
  * Gayot does not contract with third parties to share your personal information of any kind. 
  * Only you can choose to share your personal information with someone else. 
  * Gayot does not collect billing nor credit card information online. All online book orders are processed by third party companies such as Amazon.com. 



If you ever have any questions about your privacy, please email us immediately at [privacy@gayot.com](mailto:%20privacy@gayot.com). 

**Who We Are**  
André Gayot—who with his friends, Henri Gault and Christian Millau, invented the term "Nouvelle Cuisine" in the early '70s—has been directing sophisticated travelers to the best restaurants, hotels, shops, sightseeing, and cultural attractions throughout the world for over 40 years. Written by a team of savvy restaurant critics and food-and-travel experts, Gayot guidebooks are informative, honest and witty. Above all, they tell it like it is! Since 1981, "The Best Of" guides in English have become the travel bible of an international readership in quest of the best. And since 1995, "Restaurants" guides cover everything there is to know about the food and restaurant scenes of major American cities. Gayot guidebooks are complemented by a comprehensive website for up-to-date travel and restaurant information, [Gayot.com](http://www.gayot.com/). For more information about Gayot Publication, please visit the [About Us](http://www.gayot.com/aboutus/main.html) area on Gayot.com. 

**Personal Information Collection**  
Two kinds of personal information are requested during registration: personally identifiable information and demographic information. Personally identifiable information is required for registration, but other demographic information is optional and may be given at your discretion. During registration, Gayot asks for your full name and an e-mail address. Personally identifiable information is not shared with anyone, nor is it sold to anyone. The demographic information gathered includes street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone and fax. The more information you provide us with, and the more accurate it is, the easier it is for us to provide information to you that you will find useful. 

In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, such as when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. Gayot may also occasionally ask members to complete surveys that we use for internal research. Gayot also tracks information about website visitation, on an aggregated basis. Gayot calculates the aggregate number of visits to a site by all Gayot members together. 

**Personal Information Utilization**  
Your personal information is used only for demographic statistics and to display appropriately targeted advertisements. For example, Gayot does internal research on our members' demographics, interests, and behavior based on what you tell us when you register and from our server log files. In general, Gayot automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visits to Gayot. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis, meaning your personal demographic information is never directly accessed. The collective data helps us determine how often Gayot members use parts of the site, primarily so that we can improve our site to keep it as interesting and appealing as possible. Gayot may disclose aggregated user statistics so that we may describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. By providing this information, you acknowledge that Gayot may use this profile information to improve or customize the Gayot service or to provide demographic profiling to obtain advertising. Any use of profile information will be conducted in line with the guidelines set forth in this Privacy Statement. 

Note that Gayot will not send you any unsolicited information, including email, unless you have indicated your willingness to receive such information. Upon registration, new members will receive a Gayot newsletter. Members can unsubscribe to this newsletter at any time. 

**Security**  
Personal information collected by Gayot is stored and maintained in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. Gayot does not sell or rent member information to anyone, although as discussed under the section on "Personal Information Utilization," certain demographic information is made available to other sites or advertisers on an aggregated basis. When we ask you for personal information, you are sharing that information with Gayot alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. We do not share personal information with any third parties unless we have belief that such action is necessary to: either conform to legal requirements, protect the rights of Gayot, or enforce the Gayot Terms of Service. Please be aware that Gayot advertisers or websites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you when you access their site or use their services. As stated below, the information practices of third-party websites are not covered by this privacy statement.
