Data protection has a very high priority. Therefore, as a user of our website, you hereby receive all necessary information about how and for what purpose we collect data about you and about we use it. 

### Legal basis of processing

Art. 6 I lit. a GDPR is the legal basis for processing operations where we obtain consent for a particular processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfill a contract of which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, in processing operations necessary for the provision of any other service or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b GDPR. The same applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures, such as in cases of inquiries about our products or services. 

If our company is subject to a legal obligation that requires the processing of personal data, such as For the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be required to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor to our premises were injured and his or her name, age, health insurance or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d GDPR.

Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f GDPR. On this legal basis, processing operations that are not covered by any of the above legal bases are required if processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or a third party, unless the interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the person concerned prevail. Such processing operations are particularly allowed to us because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In that regard, it considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a customer of the responsible person (recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR).

### Authorized interests in the processing that are being pursued by the controller or a third party

Is the processing of personal data based on Article 6 I lit. f GDPR is our legitimate interest in carrying out our club activities to fulfill our club purpose. 

### Duration of storage of personal data

The criterion for the duration of the storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After the deadline, the corresponding data will be deleted, if they are no longer required to fulfill the contract or to initiate a contract.

### Legal or contractual provisions for the provision of personal data; Necessity for the conclusion of the contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of non-provision

We clarify that the provision of personal information is in part required by law (such as tax regulations) or may result from contractual arrangements (such as details of the contractor). Occasionally it may be necessary for a contract to be concluded that an affected person provides us with personal data that must subsequently be processed by us. For example, the data subject is required to provide us with personal information when our company enters into a contract with her. Failure to provide the personal data would mean that the contract with the person concerned could not be closed.

For all questions and concerns concerning the correction, blocking or deletion of personal data, please contact the address stated in the imprint. 

A use of our internet pages is basically possible without any indication of personal data.

However, if you use special services through our website, processing of personal data may be required. The collection and use of your data is strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Data Protection Act "Bundesdatenschutzgesetz" (BDSG) and the Telemedia Act "Telemediengesetz" (TMG). The collection of these personal data takes place on a voluntary basis, if this is possible for us. We will only share this information with third parties with your express consent. We ensure the security of your data with regard to your requests to us by using SSL encryption. At this point we point out the general dangers of internet use, which we have no influence on, because internet-based data transmissions can in principle have security gaps, so that an absolute protection can not be guaranteed on our part. Especially in e-mail traffic your data is not safe without further precautions and may be recorded by third parties. For this reason, you are free to transmit personal data to us in alternative ways, such as by phone or by post.

### Information, deletion, blocking, limitation of processing

At any time you will receive free information about the personal data we have stored about you as well as the origin, the recipient and the purpose of data collection and data processing. In addition, you have the right to request the correction, blocking or deletion of your data. This does not apply to data that is stored due to legal regulations or required for the proper conduct of business. If data is not recorded by a legal archiving obligation, we delete your data at your request. If the archiving obligation takes effect, we will block your data. If the storage purpose is deleted, the data will be deleted. 

If the accuracy of the data is disputed by the data subject, you have the right to request that the processing be restricted until the examination is completed in a reasonable time. Or we no longer need personal information for processing purposes, but the data subject requires them to assert, exercise or defend legal claims. Or the person concerned has objection to the processing conformable to art. 21 para. 1 GDPR and it is not yet clear whether the legitimate reasons for processing predominate.

### Collection of general data and information
