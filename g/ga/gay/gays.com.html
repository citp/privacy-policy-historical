<!-- <h1>Gays.com Privacy Policy</h1> -->

<p>At Gays.com we couldn’t care more about you and your privacy and are strictly following four fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We only ask you for the personal information we really need. (We believe a social network really doesn’t need to ask about your income level and whether you like cats or dogs – you provide all information you want yourself and at your privacy.)</li>
<li>We would never share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
<li>We store your personal information on our servers only as required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
<li>We offer you as many possibilities as we can for the privacy settings of your profile. We want you to be solely in control of who can see what on your Gays.com profile.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following Privacy Policy incorporates these goals.</p>

<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p>Like most website operators, Gays.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use Gays.com. From time to time, Gays.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Gays.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We do not use such information to identify the Gays.com visitors, however, and do not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that we use and disclose personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Most visitors to the Gays.com website choose to interact with Gays.com in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Gays.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a basic Gays.com account to provide a name, email address, gender, orientation, date of birth and location. Once you are a member, you may provide additional information in the profile section describing your interests, background and networking objectives. Whether or not to provide this additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely up to you, but it will allow you to better present and express yourself on Gays.com. In each case, Gays.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with Gays.com. We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Generally, visitors and members of Gays.com can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
<p>Gays.com may collect anonymous statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Gays.com may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Gays.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Gays.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide services available at the Gays.com website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Gays.com website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Gays.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Gays.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Gays.com believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Gays.com, third parties or the public at large. Gays.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Gays.com may contain links to other websites. We are not and cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave Gays.com to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally-identifying information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected at Gays.com.</p>

<h2>Email Communications</h2>
<p>If you are a registered user of the Gays.com website and have supplied your email address, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Gays.com and our services. We also use the website itself to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. You may also receive notification emails from Gays.com which inform you of actions (e.g. friend requests) that have been performed on the website. Please note that in all cases you will continue to receive all system emails (e.g. those regarding forgotten member passwords) and legal notices (e.g. updates to our policies) from Gays.com. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via a feedback mechanism), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. However, we will never provide your email address publicly on the website or to a third party without explicit permission.</p> 

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Gays.com uses cookies to help us identify and track visitors, their usage of the Gays.com website, and their website access preferences. Gays.com visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before accessing the Gays.com website, with the drawback that certain features of the Gays.com website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>In order to secure your personal information, access to your profile and personal data on Gays.com is password-protected. In order to further protect any of your data stored on our servers, we also regularly audit our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and we use a tier-one secured-access data center.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Gays.com may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Gays.com’s sole discretion. We encourage members and visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to the Privacy Policy. If you have a Gays.com account, you should also check your home page for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p> 

<h2>Effective Date of this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of April 1, 2008 and last updated April 30, 2008.
