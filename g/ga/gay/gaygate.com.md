# GayGate


    Gaygate.com attaches great value to your privacy. This privacy statement explains which details we collect from you and what we do with them. The responsibility in all this rests with Gay Group BV in Amsterdam, registered in the Commercial Register of Amsterdam under file reference number 34184879.

### General work method
    
    
    We only store and use those personal details that you provide us with, for instance, by completing your profile. You can view, change and remove all entered details on your profile page, as you see fit. If you are unable to do this, please contact us.

### Publication and search engines
    
    
    Details from your profile are published on the website and in search results, but also on the overview page and maybe even on the homepage. Other users, as well as any third parties and search engines, can view and store these. They can republish this information elsewhere, whether or not in a different format or in combination with other details they collect about you. We are unable to control this.
    
    Through your management page, we offer you the opportunity to shield certain details from non-registered users. However, in this case too, registered users can copy the information and republish it without our consent.
    
    The website offers you the opportunity to start a public video broadcast. Be discrete in what you show and remember to stop the broadcast at the end. Third parties are able to record footage of your video broadcast.

### E-mail and newsletter
    
    
    When you complete a contact or registration form on the website, or when you send us an e-mail, the personal details disclosed therein are stored for as long as the nature of the form or the contents of your e-mail allows in order to fully respond to and process these.
    
    We offer a newsletter in which we inform those interested about our products, services and related matters. Your e-mail address is added to the subscription list, subject to your explicit approval. Each newsletter contains a link to unsubscribe from the service. The newsletter subscription list is not disclosed to third parties.

### General visiting details
    
    
    The website logs general visiting details from both registered and non-registered users. Examples thereof include the IP address of your computer, your username (if applicable), the time of enquiry and details sent along by your browser. We use this information for the statistical analyses of website visiting and clicking behaviour and to show you targeted advertising.
    
    These visiting details are not disclosed to third parties, except in cases of abuse (see next paragraph). We do aggregate this information into anonymous user profiles which we make available to third parties (such as advertisers).
    
    In the event of suspected fraud or abuse of our website, we can disclose personal details to the competent authorities. 
    In the event that a third party submits a claim against us with regard to contents published by you, e.g. for defamation, privacy breach or copyright infringement, we are entitled to forward all relevant details about you to this third party. However, such a decision is only taken after having consulted you and our legal advisors.

### Use of cookies
    
    
    We use cookies in order to operate the website. A cookie is a simple, small file that is sent along with pages of this website and stored by your browser on the hard disk of your computer. This makes it possible to combine different website page requests and to analyse user behaviour, among other things. You can disable the use of cookies, although this may impair the functionality and ease of use of the website.
    
    After having logged in with your username and password, our website sends you a cookie in order to be able to recognise you during the rest of a session. Through this cookie, we can keep a log of which pages you visit. We process this information into the aforesaid user profiles, anonymously.

### Third-party websites
    
    
    This statement does not apply to websites of third parties hyperlinked to this website. We cannot guarantee that these third parties handle your personal details responsibly and safely. We recommend reading the privacy statements of these websites before using them.

### Changes to the privacy statement
    
    
    We reserve the right to make changes to this statement. We recommend consulting this statement on a regular basis, to keep yourself informed of any changes. We shall inform you of any changes by means of a profile message.

### Inspection of and changing your details
    
    
    Questions about our privacy policy or with regard to inspection of and changing (or removing) your personal details can be sent to helpdesk@gaygate.com at all times, or by post to Postbus 10482, 1001 EL in Amsterdam.
