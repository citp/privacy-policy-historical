# Marriott Online Privacy Policy | Hotel Privacy Policy Information

This privacy statement (“Statement”) applies to all of the hotel brands owned or licensed by Marriott International, Inc. and its affiliates, including The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C. (collectively, the “Marriott Group”).

We have prepared this Statement to inform you of the privacy principles that govern our use of information we obtain from our customers, including information we obtain through our websites, including Marriott.com, Ritz-Carlton.com and other websites owned or controlled by the Marriott Group (collectively, the “Websites”). As used in this Statement, the term “Authorized Licensees” means certain companies that have entered into a license or similar agreement with a Marriott Group company to sell products and services under a Marriott Group brand. Authorized Licensees are independent from the Marriott Group, and include entities such as Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation operator of the Marriott Vacation Club and Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Real Estate, and the issuer of the Marriott Rewards Credit Card.

Our Websites are available to visitors located throughout the world, and operated for different purposes. For instance, some may be specific to a hotel brand or property, and others may enable you to shop for travel-related products. Our Websites are generally operated from the United States in accordance with laws of the United States and visitors to our Websites should be aware that the laws of the United States may differ from those of your country of residence. Marriott International, Inc. and its Affiliates are certified to the U.S.-E.U. and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for the transfer of personal data to the United States, and such transfers are subject to our [European Union and Switzerland Privacy Statement](https://web.archive.org/corporateinfo/euswissprivacy.mi). Where we operate country-specific Websites, those Websites are operated in accordance with the laws of that specific country.

This Statement was last updated on **May 21, 2015** , to describe how the privacy statement applies to all of the information we obtain from you and to update the privacy statement with respect to Marriott’s Authorized Licensees, franchisees and certain other commercial partners set out below.

  * **eFolio**
    * If you are an employee or contractor of a company that participates in Marriott's eFolio Program and you use the corporate credit card that is provided to you by your employer to pay for your hotel expenses (hotel folio) at a Marriott participating property, an extract of your hotel folio detailing the goods and services provided to you during your hotel stay (as an individual traveler, or as part of a group, meeting or event) will be transferred electronically to the credit card company or its agents, who will in turn, forward that extract to your employer to facilitate the processing and tracking of the travel related expenses of their employees.

    * Your Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number, as entered on your reservation, acts as an eFolio identifier, allowing the transmission of your bill to your email address. If your Marriott or Ritz-Carlton Rewards number is applied to another person's room reservation, or if you make a reservation for another person and provide your email address for that reservation, that person's bill will be transmitted to your email address as well.
