# Gaylord Hotels Privacy Policy

Confidentiality and privacy of personal information are obligations Gaylord Hotels and its affiliates (including Gaylord Entertainment) take seriously. Gaylord Hotels maintains strict policies and procedures to protect the confidentiality of your information during all stages of our relationship. Only those individuals who need to do so as a part of their job responsibilities are authorized to have access to your information. Employees and associates of affiliated companies are required to treat all personal information as confidential. In addition, Gaylord Hotels maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and anticipated threats and hazards.

While on the Gaylord Hotel or affiliated sites, you may provide us with personally identifiable information. Gaylord Hotels asks for and maintains the personally identifiable information of its visitors and customers to provide a better, more personal experience on the site and to deliver certain services or information to you.

**Information Gathered**  
Gaylord Hotels will gather information such as what kind of browser visitors are on, what operating system they are using, their IP address, cookie information, time stamp (time page accessed as well as time spent per web page) and their clickstream information (for example, which pages they have viewed and how long they have been there). Note that information is only gathered while the visitor is on the site. Gaylord Hotels monitors how a visitor arrives at the site, but cannot and will not gather information about other third party sites the user has visited. Gaylord Hotels automatically receives and records such information on our server logs from your browser.

In certain sections of the site, Gaylord Hotels may invite you to contact us to pose questions, request information, or complete a registration form. We may ask for personally identifiable information to be entered as a means of registration before accessing a certain part of the site.

"Personally Identifiable Information" means any information that identifies you personally, including, without limitation, your name, e-mail address, password, login ID and other contact information that you voluntarily submit to us. Visitors of the site can also choose not to enter any of their Personally Identifiable Information.

Gaylord Hotels may also collect Personally Identifiable Information when you use certain Gaylord Hotels services, through the use of the Gaylord Hotels or hypersite web pages, or when you enter promotions or contests offered by Gaylord Hotels on and through the site.

When you visit the Gaylord Hotels websites, we collect information, including PII that you provide, in order to provide you with the products and services you requested or with offers or promotions that may interest you, service your accounts, and save you time and better respond to your needs.

**Usage of Personally Identifiable Information**  
Gaylord Hotels uses your personally identifiable information to register you on our site, contact you to deliver certain services or information you have requested, verify your authority to enter into certain areas of the site, improve the content and general administration of the site and our services, provide you with notices regarding our services, and, with permission, provide visitors with updates and information about Gaylord Hotels and its services.

The site may track information that will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and which will not contain your Personally Identifiable Information e.g., the total number of visitors to our site, the number of visitors to each page of our site, browser type, external web sites linked to, and IP addresses. Gaylord Hotels may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, and we may use such aggregate information to administer the site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

**Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information**  
Gaylord Hotels may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information without prior notice to you: (a) if we believe we are required to do so by law, court order, subpoena from a court with proper jurisdiction, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an ongoing investigation by a governmental authority or agency. Only information requested or described is disclosed as directed pursuant to the subpoena or court order. Subject to its legal obligations, Gaylord Hotels will notify customers of the information request as allowed by the subpoena or court order. (b) Gaylord Hotels may occasionally share personal information, purchase behavior, web usage and other navigation information with third party analytical companies. This information helps us improve the quality of our web experience and provides guidance on product and promotional offerings. This may include, but is not limited to, sharing your contact information with these third parties for the purposes of contacting you for survey and focus group opportunities. Gaylord Hotels will not share, sell, or rent your personally identifiable information to any company, organization, or third party for their promotional purposes. However, we may occasionally send you offers on behalf of our partners that we feel may be of interest or value to you. Gaylord Hotels utilizes great care in keeping customer information secure and private.

**Children's Privacy**  
No part of Gaylord Hotels or its affiliates are directed towards persons below the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18 but at least 13 years of age, you may use Gaylord Hotels website only with the involvement of a parent or guardian who agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions.

Gaylord Hotels automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your product or service usage including your cell phone number or IP address and all messages sent to Gaylord Hotels short codes.

**Cookies**  
Gaylord Hotels employs cookies in order for its server to recognize a return visitor as a unique user. Cookies are small text files placed in the 'Cookies' folder on a visitor's hard disk and allow Gaylord Hotels to remember the visitor. The cookies placed by the Gaylord Hotels server are readable only by Gaylord Hotels, and cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on a computer. All web-browsers offer the option to refuse any cookie. If a visitor refuses the Gaylord Hotels cookie, Gaylord Hotels does not gather any information on that visitor, but doing so will require you to re-enter certain information at each visit, or prevent us from customizing the site's features according to your preferences. You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive. Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information. We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
