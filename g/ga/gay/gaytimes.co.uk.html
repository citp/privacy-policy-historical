            <p>We take your contact preferences very seriously. If you would prefer for your details not to be passed to any 3rd parties as laid out in this section, you are advised not to register for the virtual product.</p>

            <h2>SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

            <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical measures to safeguard personal information against loss, theft and unauthorised uses, access or modifications.

            <h2>MAKING AUTOMATED DECISIONS</h2>

            <p>We do not ordinarily use personal information for the purposes of automated decision making. However, we may  do so in order to fulfill compelling obligations imposed by law, in which case we will inform of any such processing and provide you with an opportunity to object.</p>

			<h2>SKIM LINKS</h2>
            
			<p>This site earns revenue using Skimlinks. In the interests of disclosure and ethics, we want to be open about how we make money from our site. Besides display advertising and other paid sponsorships, we also sometimes get paid a commission if you purchase a product or service that we link to in our content. We want to be clear that our reviews are driven entirely by our editorial staff based on what we think. We use Skimlinks to help us automate the process of linking to products, especially as it distances our editorial staff from creating affiliate links themselves.</p>
            
            <p></p>			

            <h2>CONTACTING US</h2>

            <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, or no longer wish to receive anything from Millivres Prowler Ltd.  or have your data made available to 3rd parties, you can email us at <a href="mailto:kim@millivres.co.uk">kim@millivres.co.uk</a> or write to Kim Watson, MILLIVRES PROWLER LTD., Unit M, Spectrum House, 32-34 Gordon House Road, London NW5 1LP</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Please review our privacy policy on a regular basis to make sure you have read the latest version and you understand what we do with your personal information. Your continued use of our services or our web sites following the posting of changes to these terms means that you consent to those changes.</p>
