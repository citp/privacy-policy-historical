  | **Gay.com Privacy Policy**

PlanetOut Partners USA, Inc. has created this privacy policy because we value our members and recognize their right to keep personal information private. This statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the World Wide Web site located at www.gay.com (the "Gay.com Site"). We believe very strongly that private information should remain private. We'd like to hear your feedback about this statement. If you have comments or questions, please e-mail us by clicking [here](mailto:privacy@gay.com). 

**GAY.COM GATHERS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:**

**Cookies**  
Our Web site sets cookies to keep track of the contents of your shopping basket, to administer our site, to gather broad demographic information, to deliver content requested by you or specific to your interests, to customize our Web site for you, and to save your password and member name so that you don't have to enter it each time you visit. 

A cookie is a small line of data that is stored on your hard drive. Some cookies are only stored for the duration of a single browser session; others persist across sessions. We only save your password and member name if you tell us to do so; your password is encrypted, stored on your computer and transferred over the Internet in an encrypted format. Keep in mind that anyone using your Web browser would be able to access the Gay.com Site as you if you choose to store your member name and password. Gay.com's Web servers also set session ID cookies that are used to allow our servers to deliver information you request (e.g., search results). Members who do not want to receive cookies can instruct their Web browsers to refuse them; however, doing so may prevent certain parts of Gay.com's site from working (e.g., anything that requires login, including member chat, personals, or message boards). Other organizations that place advertising on Gay.com sometimes have the ability to assign a different cookie to you in a process that we do not control. Unless you've saved your member name, cookies aren't useable for identifying individuals (your computer will be assigned a random number and neither Gay.com nor advertisers will know who you are. While cookies set by Gay.com may be used to collect personally identifiable information and can be traced to an individual user, this personally identifiable information is used only for internal purposes; when information collected through cookies is shared with third parties, it is only used in aggregate form. 

**Registration Form**  
Membership on the Gay.com Site is completely optional. Gay.com's registration form requires users to give contact information (e.g., your name, address and e-mail address) and demographic information (e.g., your birthdate). On our join form, required fields are marked with an asterisk. We use this information to send members information and announcements about Gay.com (e.g., a weekly newsletter) and our partners. 

During registration, you may be offered the opportunity to receive information from third parties or to register for third-party products or services. By choosing to accept such an opportunity, you consent to Gay.com's disclosure of your contact and demographic information to that third party. Please remember that the use of your contact and demographic information by the applicable third party will be governed by that third party's own privacy policy. 

At times and only with a member's permission, Gay.com may share names and mailing and e-mail addresses with carefully selected organizations. Members may opt out of these programs by selecting "don't share my mailing address" and/or "don't share my e-mail address" on our registration form. Aggregate demographic information collected through the registration process is shared with advertisers and other partners. This aggregate information is not traceable to an individual user. 

**Order Forms**  
When purchasing products or services on the Gay.com site, you're asked for credit card, billing, and shipping information. This information is transmitted using a secure, encrypted form. You can see that the transaction is secure from the fact that the URL begins with the secure address https:// and we ensure encryption through the use of standard SSL encryption technologies. If you are not sure whether your browser is set up for security or not, you can check yourself by viewing your frame information. If you are using Windows with Netscape Communicator, just "right click" on the form page you are filling out. Then click "View Frame Info." If you are using Mac with Netscape Communicator, hold down the mouse button on the form page you are filling out until the options show. Then select "Page Info." Our secure information will appear there. 

This credit card, billing and shipping information is gathered to bill customers for goods and services purchased and to ship merchandise. Only billing vendors have access to financial information and only for the purpose of billing customers. At times Gay.com may refer users to other Web sites to purchase products. User activity on those sites is covered by the privacy policies on those sites. 

**Online Surveys**  
At times Gay.com may run online surveys asking for specific contact or demographic information. These surveys are always optional. At times Gay.com may share both the results of, and individual entries in, surveys with the sponsors of the survey. Results of surveys may be shared with partners and advertisers on an aggregate basis. 

**Contests**  
At times Gay.com may run contests on the Site where we ask for contact or demographic information. These contests are always optional. At times Gay.com may share both the results of, and individual entries in, contests with the sponsors of the contests. Results of contests may be shared with partners and advertisers on an aggregate basis. 

**Message Boards, Chat Rooms, Polls, and Community Tools**  
Gay.com provides many venues for member interaction and community, including message boards, chat rooms, online polls, and other tools. In some cases use of such tools (e.g., chat rooms and message boards) may reveal a user's member name or e-mail address and may permit users to publish certain personal information (e.g., Web page links and content ratings) on the Gay.com Site. In all cases, users affirmatively choose to expose or place this information in public areas of the Gay.com Site, and thereby agree that such information may be viewed by or forwarded to anyone. Users who do not want this information to be publicly available should not use these optional features on the Gay.com Site. The aggregate result of polls may be shared on the Gay.com Site. 

**Gay.com Personals and Premium Personals**  
Gay.com permits users to submit personal information for use in both our Personals and Premium Personals. This information is stored for the purposes of member self-publishing and interaction and we may also use this information to customize your Gay.com experience. By registering for Gay.com Personals and submitting your user information, you understand that anyone may have access to and forward this information. As with all parts of the Gay.com Site, we will not use Gay.com Personals to knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. 

Gay.com permits users to submit additional adult-oriented personal information for use in the Gay.com Premium Personals service. This information is also stored for the purposes of member self-publishing and interaction and to customize the user's Gay.com site experience. By registering for Gay.com Premium Personals and submitting your additional user information, you understand that anyone may access and forward this information. Gay.com will not knowingly collect Premium Personals information from those under the age of 18. 

The feature of the site previously known as Member Profiles has been replaced with the new Personals and Premium Personals services and is subject to the terms applicable to Personals and Premium Personals. 

**Member Feedback**  
Gay.com stores feedback members send to us. This feedback is used to administer and refine the Gay.com Site and associated services and at times may be shared with Gay.com partners either in aggregate form or individually with specific identifying characteristics about the Member (e.g., e-mail address or name) removed. 

**IP Addresses/Clear GIFs**  
Gay.com tracks individual IP addresses and uses clear GIFs to help diagnose problems with our service, to administer our site and to gather broad demographic information. User IP address information is used only for our internal purposes. Information gathered through our use of clear GIFs cannot be traced to an individual user and is used only for our internal purposes. 

**ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE SCENARIOS**  
Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, Gay.com may also disclose personal and aggregate information when required by a valid legal mechanism such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, or when we deem it necessary, in our sole discretion, to protect our rights and the safety of others, or our members, employees, or properties. 

Gay.com believes that members' private communications in chat rooms, e-mail, and instant message-like conversations should generally remain confidential. Gay.com does not read or disclose private communications unless ordered to do so through a valid legal mechanism such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, to protect the company's rights and property, or during emergencies when we believe safety is at risk. Please remember that what you write or post in public areas such as chat rooms and message boards is available to all Gay.com members, and in many cases other visitors to the Gay.com site. Also keep in mind that Gay.com is not responsible for what other users may do with private communications you've had with them. While chat and instant message-like conversations pass through Gay.com's servers, we do not store logs of these conversations. 

Gay.com reserves the right to share some or all of your personal information with its parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures or other companies under common control with Gay.com, in which case Gay.com will require such entities to honor this privacy policy. If Gay.com is acquired by another company, that company will obtain the member information collected by Gay.com and will assume the rights and obligations set forth in this privacy policy regarding that information.

**AD SERVER**  
Gay.com uses a reputable third party to serve some of the advertisements you see on the pages of the Gay.com Site. We use clear GIFs, or pixel tags, provided by our ad serving company to help manage our advertising. These clear GIFs allow our ad serving company to recognize a browser's cookie when the browser visits the Gay.com Site. This allows us to learn which banner ads bring users to our site. The information we collect and share through this technology is not linked to any information that would allow our ad server to personally identify our users. For more information about our ad serving company or for your choices about not having this anonymous information used, please click [here](http://www.privacychoices.org/). 

**CHANGE POLICY**  
From time to time we may revise this privacy notice. If we make a material change, we will post a notice on the Gay.com Web site or notify you by e-mail, at which time you'll be able to "opt out" of these new practices by contacting us (using the contact information above).
