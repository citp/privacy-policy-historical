GaGa Trends Online must keep and use customer data reliably. We value your trust and will never sell your information to third parties.

### Customer personal information and how it’s used?

Personal information is considered any information that is definite to you, such as your email address, credit card information, name, body measurement etc.

When you make a purchase, we need your address, phone number and credit card information (if purchasing by credit card). This information is amassed in a secure database, only open to selected employees with access rights to this information. 

Additionally, The GaGa Trends Online logs your Internet Protocol Address (IP). An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when browsing the Internet. Information from IP addresses is used for system administration, to examine overall traffic trends, troubleshooting, etc. This information is used only in the aggregate form. IP addresses are not linked to any PII, meaning that your session on our site is tracked, but will not be linked to any personal information.

### How protected is my personal information?

Customer information is protected with GaGa Trends Online! To protect customer order information is a main concern. Only selected and related employees can access the customer data with the permission of the company owner. So customer payment details, measurement details, email addresses and home or office addresses are very secure.
