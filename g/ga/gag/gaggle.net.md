### Background

Gaggle has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy, and in particular our pledge to ensure the safety of our student users. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Gaggle web site.

In general Gaggle automatically gathers usage information like frequency of users to certain areas, number of log-ins, number of e-mails sent and received, etc. We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps Gaggle determine how often certain areas of the site are being visited so we can improve the site to make it as user friendly as possible. We use your assigned access level to deliver content specific to your interests or position.

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information such as their name and email address. We use this contact information from the registration form to verify your status as a teacher or school district employee and your affiliation with a particular school, district, or educational institution. This is done to protect the safety of our users. We at Gaggle want to provide safe, controlled e-mail accounts for students and teachers. The customer's registration information is also used to contact the user with information about our company and updates to the Gaggle E-mail Service.

In the future Gaggle will ask our users to voluntarily provide their date of birth and gender. This personal information is collected from student users for the purposes of targeted advertising and to insure that our younger users are not exposed to material appropriate for an older audience.

### Disclosure

We do not disclose personal information such as your name, address, email address or telephone numbers to any outside companies. But, as mentioned above, we may share with our Web site partners aggregated information regarding the overall use of Gaggle.

### Third-Party Advertising

Gaggle uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see the links below for our Ad Network Partners:

### Demographic Data

In the future, advertising shown to users may be based upon demographic data that has been collected during the sign up process. Such data would include geographic location, age, and gender. Targeting based upon this data will enable us to ensure that advertisements are appropriate for the age of the user and of general interest to users fitting a specific profile. We welcome your feedback on this topic and encourage you to [email us](mailto:admin@gaggle.net) your thoughts.

### Security

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. Users should be aware, however, that Gaggle cannot guarantee security and confidentiality. Users should also be aware that the use of Gaggle E-mail is not private. While Gaggle does not routinely monitor message content, it may be necessary to back up or review messages to identify network problems or if a user has violated the terms of service. Gaggle, at its' discretion, may choose to turn over or make available message content to appropriate personnel or law enforcement agencies if required.

### Student Safety

Gaggle supports the efforts of COPPA to insure the online safety of children. Email accounts on the Gaggle system are provided only through a qualified school or educational organization. Schools receive a master account which enables them to create accounts for student users. Schools should obtain parental permission before issuing accounts to students.

We meet the following guidelines listed below and agree to:

  * NOT collect online contact information without the consent of either a parent or a qualified educational institution. Without prior parental consent, online information will only be used to respond directly to the child's request and will not be used for other purposes without prior parental consent
  * NOT collect personally identifiable offline contact information without prior parental consent 
  * NOT distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information without prior parental consent 
  * NOT give the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent 
  * NOT entice by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity or to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity
