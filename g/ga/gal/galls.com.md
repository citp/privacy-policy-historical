6\. Security Procedures in Place to Protect Information  


You are an important customer at Galls and your online ordering is highly valued.

Our web servers are authenticated by VeriSign so you can trust that you are doing business with Galls. We protect the security of credit card and other sensitive information you provide online by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) security software that encrypts such information. The security features are automatic. For example, once you've clicked the SUBMIT button on the Checkout page, your browser looks for a digital certificate to confirm that it is communicating with Galls.com. Once a positive ID is made, your order continues. We use VeriSign software to enable the use of digital certificates. You can click on the VeriSign logo (on the Galls homepage) to verify that Galls.com is a VeriSign site. For your security, the verification process happens in the background every time you place an order on our site.

Additionally, Galls employs industry standard firewall and anti-virus protection along with maintaining vendor security patches. We also utilize a 3rd party security scanning service to scan our web servers and web sites to assure we are up to industry standards in regard to patching and security configurations.

Although Galls has implemented measures designed to secure personal information collected on our website from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.

If you have any questions or concerns about security on the Galls site, please feel free to send an e-mail to: [help-desk@galls.com](mailto:help-desk@galls.com).
