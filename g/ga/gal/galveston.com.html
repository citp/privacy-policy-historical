		</b></font> <br><br> <font size="2" face="arial,helvetica" color="#000000">Your
		privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operation of
		GALVESTON.COM, GALVESTONCVB.COM, GALVESTONTOURISM.COM, GALVESTONPARKBOARD.ORG,
		GALVESTONONLINE.COM, GALVESTONTEXAS.US, GALVESTONTX.US, VISITGALVESTONTEXAS.COM
		and ESCAPEANDEXPLORE.COM (henceforth, referred to as "OUR WEBSITE(S)"), we
		gather certain types of information about OUR WEBSITE(S) users, and we would
		like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how
		to correct or change the information. <br><br>OUR WEBSITE(S) collect two types
		of personally identifying information from users: personal data (such as names
		and e-mail addresses); and aggregated data (such as information about traffic
		patterns on OUR WEBSITE(S) on a daily basis). <br><br><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica" color="#3366cc"><b>Personal Data</b><br><br></font>
		Personal data is collected when users provide personal data to OUR WEBSITE(S),
		for example in registering for electronic newsletters or other membership
		services, in answering surveys, in requesting information, and purchasing items
		from OUR WEBSITE(S). Also, we collect the e-mail addresses of users who post
		messages to our message boards (forum). <br><br><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica" color="#3366cc"><b>Aggregated Information
		</b><br><br></font> Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or
		visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or
		site registrations, is collected through various methods. For example, OUR
		WEBSITE(S) collect IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is
		automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web
		servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your
		computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from OUR WEBSITE(S) do
		not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your
		session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us. OUR WEBSITE(S) collect
		IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to provide aggregate
		data to advertisers about the volume of use on OUR WEBSITE(S). <br><br><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica" color="#3366cc"><b>Use of Cookies
		</b><br><br></font> OUR WEBSITE(S) also use "cookies" to collect information. A
		cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive
		for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow OUR WEBSITE(S)
		to measure activity on the Site and to improve your user experience, for
		example, by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing
		you to visit various member-only parts of the Site without reregistering.
		Cookies are used by OUR WEBSITE(S) to measure activity on the Site and make
		improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not.
		OUR WEBSITE(S) do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer
		that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except for personal information
		voluntarily provided by you (i.e., during membership registration or a request
		for information), OUR WEBSITE(S) do not use information transferred through
		cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information
		shared with any third parties whatsoever. You may occasionally get cookies from
		our advertisers, which is standard in the Internet industry. OUR WEBSITE(S) do
		not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to OUR WEBSITE(S)
		privacy policies.<br><br> Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If
		you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies
		are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the Site will not
		function properly if you do so. <br><br><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica" color="#3366cc"><b>Use of Information Collected by GALVESTON.COM,
