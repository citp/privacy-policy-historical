# Privacy Policy | GalTime

When you decide to become a member of GalTime.com, we ask you for some personal information like your name, gender, birth date and email address. When creating your account, you must provide accurate information.

Your mailing address is only required if you plan on entering GalTime giveaways and contests.

GalTime will not share this information with anyone outside of GalTime, its parent company or its partners unless you choose to enter a giveaway or contest and it is required in order to deliver your gift/prize, or we are required to do so by law or subpoena. We will never sell your information to anyone.

You do not have to register to visit the GalTime website, but in order to access certain features, such as our social network components, and to enter our giveaways, you will need to open a member account. You are solely responsible for any activity that occurs in your account.

You are asked to choose a user-name and password. You must keep your password secure and notify GalTime immediately of any unauthorized use of your account. GalTime will not be liable for any losses caused by the unauthorized use of your account.

Any personal information or content that you post voluntarily on GalTime or its social network becomes available to the public. GalTime reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the User Content posted on its site. GalTime has the right to edit or remove any material that in its opinion, violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Use Agreement or to protect its rights or those of any third party.

GalTime allows other companies to serve advertisements on its site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Galtime.com. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens.

**Links to Other Web Sites**

We are not responsible for the practices employed by Websites linked to or from GalTime.com, nor the content contained therein. Your interaction on any other Website is subject to that Website’s own policies.
