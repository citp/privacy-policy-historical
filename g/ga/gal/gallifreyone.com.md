# Outpost Gallifrey

The only individually-identifiable customer information collected on Outpost Gallifrey is in our discussion community (the Forum) which collects names, e-mail addresses, IP addresses, and personal information volunteered on a free-will basis by customers wishing to participate in the Forum. Additionally, email addresses of those who participate in the Gallifrey Conventions/Gallifrey One mailing list (an opt-in mailing list administered by Yahoo! Groups) are collected, again on an at-will basis.

Outpost Gallifrey will not disclose individual customer information to any third parties without the customer's permission, and maintains its mailing list on a private, secure, internal database. However, any users who wish to participate in the Forum are required to provide a valid e-mail address as a condition of participation, which will not publicly viewable but will be visible to the Forum staff. A customer may opt out at any time, and have their user ID and account removed by e-mailing the webmaster through the [email gateway](https://web.archive.org/web/20051213210337id_/http%3A//www.gallifreyone.com/mail.php). The administrators of the Forum reserve the right _not_ to remove any posts from a user who opts out of the Forum.

Outpost Gallifrey does not collect any individually-identifiable personal profile information from its customers, except when offered in the context of customer support.

Outpost Gallifrey will only send someone updates by e-mail if they opt to receive them. A customer may opt-out at any time by e-mailing via our [email gateway](https://web.archive.org/web/20051213210337id_/http%3A//www.gallifreyone.com/mail.php) with 24 hours notice.

Outpost Gallifrey will only view customer profile information in anonymized, aggregate form for statistical purposes.

Outpost Gallifrey promises to amend this privacy policy as needed, and make it available online.

Any and all questions regarding privacy issues can be addressed through the [email gateway](https://web.archive.org/web/20051213210337id_/http%3A//www.gallifreyone.com/mail.php).
