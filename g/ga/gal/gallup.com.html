					<b>The Gallup Organization - Privacy Policy</b><br>
					</font>
					<p>
					
					</p><p>
					<font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
					Protection of personal privacy has always been a hallmark of The Gallup Organization.  Since its inception in 1935, Gallup has maintained the anonymity of each survey respondent unless express consent to the release of a respondent's personal information or individual responses has been provided by that respondent.  In a like manner, Gallup protects the identity of individuals who access its Web sites.  Please read the following policy for further details as to the types of information collected through Gallup Web sites, including personal information, and how it is treated.
						</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
						

</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><font color="#003300"><b>INFORMATION COLLECTED BY GALLUP WEB SITES</b></font>
</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
Gallup Web sites gather information in two ways: (1) indirectly (for example, through our site's technology), and (2) directly (for example, when you, the site visitor, voluntarily provide information on various pages).
</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
						<font color="#003300">
						<i><b>Information Collected Indirectly</b></i></font>
						<br>

Gallup indirectly collects a variety of information pertaining to use of its Web sites.  One type of this information is that which is related to site traffic volume and patterns, such as the number of visitors to a given site or page on a daily basis.  This type of indirectly collected information is gathered through various means, such as an IP address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web.  Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address.  When you visit a page from Gallup, our servers log your computer's IP address.

</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Only designated administrators can access this information, and it is used only for administrative and planning purposes to meet the needs of our users, such as to improve the content of the site and to customize the content and/or layout of the site for individuals or groups of users.

</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Other types of indirectly collected information are stored in "cookies."  Cookies are small files of electronic information that a Web site can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to help that visitor while on the site.  Some Gallup sites use cookies simply to store a user code so that the user does not have to re-enter their information when rejoining the site.  The use of cookies is standard on the Internet.  Although most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, the decision of whether to accept them is yours.  A browser can usually be adjusted to prevent the reception of cookies, or to provide notification whenever a cookie is sent to you.  Even without accepting a cookie, users can still access most of the features offered by Gallup Web sites.
</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
						<font color="#003300">
						<i><b>Information Collected Directly</b></i></font>
						<br>

Gallup also collects information that is voluntarily provided by site visitors, such as a name or an e-mail address.  When Gallup collects this type of information, we will notify you as to why we are asking for the information and how it will be used.   It is entirely your decision to provide the requested information.   Such personal data is collected when a site visitor registers with a site or requests Web services.  This information is kept totally confidential, and will be used only to contact you.  You may choose to have this information removed at any time.  Gallup will never barter, trade, or sell access to our database of registered users.
</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
						<font color="#003300">
						<i><b>Correcting and Changing User Information and Preferences</b></i></font>
						<br>

If you are receiving e-mail communications from Gallup but wish to discontinue this service, you may request to do so at any time by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:Privacy_Administrator@Gallup.com">Privacy_Administrator@Gallup.com</a>.

</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">You also have the option to request a revision of your user information at any time by e-mailing the requested changes to <a href="mailto:Privacy_Administrator@Gallup.com">Privacy_Administrator@Gallup.com</a>.
</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
						<font color="#003300">
						<i><b>Information Security</b></i></font>
						<br>

Gallup employees understand the need for user privacy, and we maintain strict security procedures to protect your information.  Gallup has appointed a Privacy Policy Administrator to monitor privacy practices.  Access to user data is strictly limited to specific individuals who are trained to respect user privacy.  The access given to these employees is restricted to their need of such information for business reasons.  A log of those who accessed the data is maintained and monitored to prevent security breaches.
</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
						<font color="#003300">
						<i><b>Third-Party Information Storage</b></i></font>
						<br>

Some information is stored for Gallup by authorized third-party companies.  These companies are carefully selected by Gallup.  We limit such third parties in their access to and use of your personal information, and like Gallup, they will never barter, trade, or sell access to your information.
</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
						<font color="#003300">
						<i><b>Children and Privacy</b></i></font>
						<br>

Gallup encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children.  Gallup sites will not contain content that is generally considered unsuitable for children.
</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
						<font color="#003300">
						<i><b>Links to Other Sites</b></i></font>
						<br>

Gallup Web sites may contain links to sites owned and/or operated by other organizations, and the privacy policies of those sites may differ from that of Gallup.  These sites may collect data and make use of it in ways that Gallup does not.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on all third-party sites.
</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
						<font color="#003300">
						<i><b>Transfer of Information to the United States</b></i></font>
						<br>

In accessing Gallup Web sites, you may be transferring personal data that is used by Gallup for statistical, administration, or marketing purposes. As a worldwide organization, Gallup collects data that may be transferred internationally throughout Gallup offices worldwide. In using any Gallup site you consent to having your information transferred to and processed in the United States or any other country in which Gallup is located.  If Gallup seeks to collect any additional personal data, you will be informed of the proposed uses of that data and asked for your consent.
</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
						<font color="#003300">
						<i><b>Policy Updates</b></i></font>
						<br>
 
This Privacy Policy is Gallup's promise to its Web site users.  Additional information that is particular to specific Gallup sites may exist, and updates to this policy may be posted.  For these reasons we suggest that users who may have specific concerns about the information being gathered and use of that information regularly view the Privacy Policy on each site.  Gallup reserves the right to change the policy on use of information collected at any time.
