				    <h4>Websites</h4>
<p>We currently operate the web site <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com" target="_blank">www.us.playstation.com</a>. In addition, we own several other domain names that point to the web sites listed  above. From time to time we may add new sites that may not be listed above, but  will provide a link to this policy. </p>
				    <h4>Links</h4>
				 <p> This policy applies only to sites maintained by SCEA or our subsidiaries. We  may create links to the websites of our promotional partners and licensed  software publishers or other entities that are owned or affiliated with SCEA. Although we will make every effort to link only to sites that meet similar standards for maintaining each individual's right to privacy, this policy does  not apply to third party sites. Additionally, many other sites that we are not  associated with and have not authorized may have links leading to one of our  sites. We cannot control these links and are not responsible for any content appearing on these sites.</p>
				 
    <h4>Collection of Personal Information through our Websites</h4>
				  <p>We do not require that visitors reveal any personally identifying information  in order to access our websites. However, visitors who do not wish to, or are not allowed by law to share personally identifying information, may not be able to access certain areas or participate in certain activities (like making a purchase or entering a promotion) which require registration.</p>
				  
				 <p>Although information may be required to participate in certain promotions or  sales offered through our websites, participants provide information on a voluntary basis only. Generally, we may wish to collect personal information about you in connection with the following services:</p>
				<ul type="disc">
                  <li>Participation in online contests, sweepstakes or other promotions </li>
				  <li>Questions or comments sent through our websites </li>
				  <li>Inclusion in our email newsletter program </li>
				  <li>Participation on our message boards </li>
				  <li>Registration to become a registered user of our site and a member of the PlayStation Underground </li>
				  <li>Repair of, replacement of or service on system hardware</li>
                  <li>Verification of a SOCOM account or purchase through a SOCOM Store</li>
			  </ul>
				  <p>Collection of personal information for these services may include the  collection of your name, address, telephone number, email address,  hardware/software information and/or credit card number or personal check  information. </p>
  <h4>Collection of Demographic Information through www.playstation.com</h4>
				 <p> From time to time we will offer visitors the chance to answer questions about  their favorite PlayStation products and other issues. This general and  demographic information (such as gender, game and platform preferences,  hobbies, recently purchased products and date of birth) is collected  anonymously and will not be linked to any personally identifying information  through cookies* or other methods, without the approval of the user. (*To learn  more about what "cookies" are and how we may use them, please see the  section titled "Cookies" below.) </p>
  <p>Underground members are also asked, but are not required, to provide  demographic information that is connected to their personally identifying  information, to create their Underground Member profile. This information is  compiled so that we can create a site that better serves the needs and  interests of our Underground Members. For further information on our collection  of information from Underground Members, see the PlayStation Underground  Members section below. </p>
  <h4>How We Use Your Information</h4>
  <p>Personally identifying information, which we collect for a particular  promotional purpose or sale through our websites, will be saved and used only  for that purpose, unless the participant chooses to opt-in to one of the  programs discussed below or is creating a verified SOCOM account or making a  purchase through a SOCOM Store. Consumers who create a Verified SOCOM Account or make a purchase through  a SOCOM Store automatically become members of the PlayStation Underground  (described below). They are sent an  email that confirms this membership and provides a method to opt out of  PlayStation Underground membership.</p>
				<p>Information obtained from customers who contact  our consumer services department or submit an online complaint will be  maintained by the consumer services department, so that we may use it to assist  these customers on current or future service issues. Additional information  such as credit card, personal check information may be collected by our  consumer services department if you contact them to request repair of, exchange  of or service on your PLAYSTATION 3 system, PlayStation 2 system, PlayStation  console, PS one system or PSP hardware system. This information is used only  for payment verification purposes. </p>
                   
				  <p>When you have provided personally identifying information for a particular  purpose, we may disclose your information to certain third parties that we have  engaged to assist us in fulfilling your request and in maintaining our database  records. This includes, but is not limited to, fulfillment houses, transaction  managers, credit verification services and data management companies. SCEA may  share information with appropriate third parties, including law enforcement or  other similar entity, in connection with a criminal investigation,  investigation of fraud, infringement of intellectual property rights, or other  activity that is suspected to be illegal or may expose you or SCEA to legal  liability.</p>
  <h4>PlayStation Underground Members</h4>
  <p>We offer all purchasers of our PlayStation product and visitors to our websites  the opportunity to become a member of the PlayStation Underground. Consumers  may also register for the PlayStation Underground outside of these websites by  mail, telephone, by registering their Network Adaptor (Ethernet/Modem) (for  PlayStation®2) or their PlayStation®2 with integrated network and line  connectors for online gaming through the Online Start-Up Disc or by creating a PLAYSTATION® Network account (see PSN Privacy Policy  for details). Consult the product manual for full details.</p>
  <p>Membership in the PlayStation Underground is free and grants the member certain rights which may include, but are not limited to, discount offers, game news,  free demo discs, access to restricted areas of our websites, the opportunity to be a registered user or subscriber of our websites and more. We may also share information collected from PlayStation Underground members with other Sony  companies, affiliates and subsidiaries, who we think will provide you with  additional information you'll enjoy.</p>
  <p>We will give PlayStation Underground Members the opportunity to provide information about themselves on the registration materials, and will from time to time send out surveys or questionnaires for members to provide additional  information. Underground Members may also be given the opportunity to link to store locators for our retail partners. We will share your Underground  registration number only with our retail partners so that our partner can let us know about any purchases you make. Our partner will delete your number from  its records once we have received this information or if you do not make a purchase. We will use the information about your purchases, whether from us or  from our retail partners, to update members' records and make their PlayStation  experience more enjoyable. </p>
				<p>If you choose to download content from this site you will be asked to consent to  having information regarding these activities, from other internal sources and/or  from other Sony related entities or affiliates connected with and added to your  Underground profile. This will allow us  to provide you with information about our products that best suit your  interests and customize your experience. Members of the PlayStation Underground who join after August 23, 2005,  also consent to having their personal information connected to data regarding  their activities and purchases in this manner.</p>
                   <p>
                  <a name="OLE_LINK1" id="OLE_LINK1">Finally, as we operate internationally, and many of our  computer systems are based in the United States, your personal data and  information will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and  privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other  parts of the world, such as the European Union.</a></p>
				<p>Additionally, we may also use your personal information for  marketing and demographic studies. Such studies may be conducted by us or by an  outside firm hired by us. These studies are for internal purposes only, to help  us improve our web sites and products to better meet your needs. We may share  non-personally identifying information and behavioral data.</p>
				<h4>Your California Privacy Rights/ Information Sharing Policy</h4>
				<p>PlayStation Underground Members whose information is collected through us.playstation.com will have an additional option to "opt-in" to have their information shared with our promotional partners, licensed software publishers, licensed peripheral makers and other licensees (Our Partners). This will give us the opportunity to work with partners to provide you with additional material on PlayStation and related product, which we think you will enjoy. </p>
				<p>Beginning on January 1,  2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of SCEA who are  California residents to request certain information regarding SCEA’s disclosure  within the immediately preceding calendar year of the California resident’s personal  information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; To make such a request, contact our Consumer  Services group through the following link: <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/Corporate/ConsumerServices" target="_blank">http://www.us.playstation.com/Corporate/ConsumerServices</a><o:p></o:p></span></font> or via telephone at 1-800-345-7669. If you would like to change your current account preferences, please click on the following link: <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><a href="https://secureus.playstation.com/Registration/SignIn" target="_blank">https://secureus.playstation.com/Registration/SignIn</a><o:p></o:p></span></font>.</p>
				<p>Except for law enforcement and certain third parties that we have engaged to assist us in fulfilling your requests and maintaining our database records, your personally identifying information will not be shared with non-Sony parties unless participants choose this option or register through the PLAYSTATIONNetwork.</p>
				
				<h4>Policies for Children 12 Years Old and Under</h4>
                    <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifying information through our  websites from children 12 and under. We encourage parents to take an active  role to protect the privacy of their children and to prevent inappropriate uses  of information about their children. Parents should instruct their children never to provide their real names or any other identifying information on the  web without first getting permission.</p>
 <p> We encourage parents to register for the PlayStation Underground on their  child's behalf so that parents can supervise their child's participation on our  websites.</p>
				<h4>Business Contacts</h4>
				<p>For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in a  business capacity different from information we receive in a non-business  capacity. Personal information  submitted to us in a business capacity (e.g. resumes, potential developer  contact information) may be shared with other Sony Companies or third parties,  depending on the nature of the inquiry. </p>
				<p>Through our job page at http://www.us.playstation.com/jobs/,  SCEA allows job seekers to inquire about jobs and submit personal information  to apply for employment. If you inquire about a position and create a profile, we may use the personal information that  you provide to contact you about positions that may be of interest to you,  determine whether or not you qualify for a position or process your employment application. If you create a job  profile, you will be asked to provide your email address and create a password. You can use your email address and password to access your account, review the information in your profile, edit and delete your profile at any time.</p>
				<h4>Cookies</h4>
                   <p>Cookies are bits of electronic information which a website can transfer to a  visitor's hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit at the site. Cookies allow website operators to better tailor visits to the site to  visitor's individual preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many major web sites use them.</p>
 <p> We may use cookies in certain areas to improve your experience when visiting our websites. They may be used to anonymously track interest and collect aggregate information on various parts of the sites. Cookies will also be used  to keep track of your shopping cart in our online store. If you are a  PlayStation Underground member, cookies will be used each time you visit to  tell our websites not to prompt you for your PSU number and password more than  once per session.</p>
  <h4>Log Files</h4>
 <p>We may use log files to gather statistics about our users' browsing habits and to assess overall website activity, including how many "hits" a particular web page is getting. These entries are generated anonymously, and enable us to track interest in specific  promotions, troubleshoot technical concerns, and provide you with content  that is most interesting to you. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer, or browser.</p>
				<h4>Web Beacons</h4>
				<p>Our  websites use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including  Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites. We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our websites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our websites. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information  on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.</p>
				<h4>Message  Boards</h4>
                   <p>Our web site message boards are a place where users can go to freely share  their thoughts and ideas about all that's PlayStation. Bulletin Board  participants must adhere to our standard website terms of use, as well as  additional terms and conditions which are posted in that section. Any information we collect for participation in the Bulletin Board section will  adhere to this privacy policy. We ask our users to respect the privacy of  others. Posting of phone numbers, addresses, or other personal information in the Bulletin Board section, which may violate someone's privacy is prohibited. Additionally, we prohibit the posting by any user of his or her own personally  identifying information. We reserve the right to remove any postings that  violate this rule or any other term or condition posted on this site. Additionally, We reserve the right to ban any user who has violated this requirement.</p>
 <h4>Accuracy &amp; Security</h4>
  <p> We seek to maintain reasonable security measures in order to  attempt to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the personally  identifying information under our control. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as perfect security. As a result, although we strive to protect  your personally identifying information, we cannot ensure or warrant the  security of any information you transmit to us through or in connection with  our website or that we store on our systems or that is stored on our service  providers' systems.</p>
  <h4>Contact Us</h4>
 <p>For further information on our privacy policy, or for questions on information that we may have collected from you, or should you wish to have your name removed from the PlayStation Underground mailing list,  please contact us by either of the following methods and we will be happy to review, update, or change  your record status as appropriate:</p>
