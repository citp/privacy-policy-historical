Privacy Policy and Legal Statement

Privacy Policy  
We take the privacy of our supporters seriously and are committed to protecting your privacy.  
This Policy explains the privacy and the data protection practices that apply to all websites operated by GODNET.TV, INC. 350 Conover Blvd W Suite 315 Conover, NC 28613

Our aim is to safeguard privacy while providing a personalized and valuable service. Collecting personal information is necessary if we are to satisfy the expectations and requirements of our users, e.g. by communicating with them and providing an interactive service. We appreciate that you do not want the personal information you provide to us distributed indiscriminately and here we explain how we collect information, what we do with it and what controls you have.

The information we collect

We collect two kinds of information about our users:

\- non-personal information such as IP address (the location of the computer on the internet), pages accessed and files downloaded. This helps us to determine how many individuals use our sites, how many people visit on a regular basis, which pages are most popular and which pages are least popular. This information doesn’t tell us anything about who you are or where you live, it simply allows us to monitor and improve our service.

\- personal information such as name, postal address, telephone number, email address, date of birth (where appropriate), card or bank details, etc. We collect this information only in connection with specific activities such as requests for publications, product purchases, feedback, donations, etc. The information is either needed to fulfill your request or to enable us to provide you with a more personalized service. You don’t have to disclose any of this information to browse the sites. However, if you do choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.

Any personal data relating to you will be used and recorded by us in accordance with current data protection legislation and this Privacy Policy.

We will use the information you provide to us to:

\- process donations, sales transactions, or other payments

\- handle orders, deliver products and communicate with you about orders

\- provide a personalized service to you when you visit our websites e.g. by customizing the content and/or layout of our pages for each individual user

\- record any contact we have with you

\- communicate with you by appropriate means such as written communication, email, SMS message, and other methods as appropriate technology develops.

\- prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our websites and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf

\- in aggregate (and therefore anonymously) to profile your use of the websites and carry out research on our users’ demographics, interests and behavior to help us gain a better understanding of how our users navigate and use the websites, and to enable us to improve our service to you.

We may use other companies to provide services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer’s questions about products or services, sending postal mail, emails and text messages, analyzing data, processing credit card payments and contacting supporters. We will only provide those companies with the information they need to deliver the service and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. We require all such companies to treat your personal information as fully confidential and to fully comply with all applicable United States Data Protection and consumer legislation.

We may disclose aggregate statistics about our site visitors, customers and sales in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.

We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property or personal safety of GODNET.TV Inc., the site or its visitors.

Except as indicated above we will not use or transfer this data to any third parties without your prior permission.

Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized personnel have access to user information.
