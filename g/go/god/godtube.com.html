    <div class="article articleBody">
        <p>
	Salem Web Network ("We" or "Company") recognizes that its customers, visitors, users and others who use <span>GodTube.com</span> or other websites owned or operated by Company (collectively, the “Site”) (collectively or individually “Users”) value their privacy. This Privacy Policy details important information regarding the use and disclosure of User information collected on the Sites. Company provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Site.<br>
	<br>
	This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the Company Terms of Use. Your use of the Site and any personal information you provide on the Site remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.<br>
	<br>
	Please note that any video, audio, image and/or any other content posted at the direction of Users onto the Site becomes published content and is not considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy.<br>
	The Information Company Collects<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * When you visit <span>GodTube.com</span>, you provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us and Website use information collected by us as you interact with our Website. You may provide us with information by such things as uploading videos, posting messages in our forums or in the video comments section, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys or subscribing to newsletters or other mailing lists.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * When you register with <span>GodTube.com</span>, you provide us with certain personal information, including but not limited to your name, your email address, your telephone number, your address, your gender, schools attended and any other personal or preference information that you may provide to us.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * When you enter <span>GodTube.com</span>, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is generally gathered for all GodTube visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to GodTube. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Log File Information: When you use the Site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include, but are not limited to, information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Clear GIFs Information: When you use the Site, we may employ “clear GIFs” (<span>a.k.a</span>. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our Users anonymously (<span>i.e</span>., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * When you use GodTube, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, form groups, set up events, add applications and transmit information through various channels as these services are added to the Site. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * You post User Content (as defined in the Terms of Use) on the Site at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Content.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on GodTube is a violation of the Terms of Use and should be reported immediately.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site or our sharing service for videos, photos and similar items, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as your friend’s email address. If it is the invitation service, we will send your friend an email or instant message in your name inviting him or her to visit the site, and may send up to two reminders to them. If it is the sharing service, GodTube will add any email addresses that you share materials with to our database and those individuals may begin receiving GodTube emails. GodTube stores this information to send invitations and reminders, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, to allow you to see invitations you have sent and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * GodTube may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs and other users of the GodTube service through the operation of the service (<span>e.g</span>., content tags) in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * By using GodTube and the Service, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.<br>
	<br>
	The Way Company Uses Information<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * When you register with GodTube, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your name, email and photo, are displayed to people in the networks specified in your privacy settings to enable you to connect with people on GodTube. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by GodTube that we think you may find valuable.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Profile information is used by GodTube primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information by your privacy settings. In some cases where your privacy settings permit it (<span>e.g</span>., posting to your wall), other GodTube users may be able to supplement your profile.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Profile information you submit to GodTube will be available to users of GodTube who belong to at least one of the networks you allow to access the information through your privacy settings (<span>e.g</span>., school, geography, friends of friends). Your name, network names and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the GodTube network and those limited pieces of information may be made available to third party search engines. This is primarily so your friends can find you and send a friend request.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * GodTube may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. For instance, if a friend sends you a new message, or someone posts on your profile page, you may receive an email alerting you to that fact. Generally, you may opt out of such emails by clicking the Unsubscribe button at the bottom of any GodTube email, though GodTube reserves the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * GodTube may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people in a network like a band or movie and personalizing advertisements and promotions so that we can provide you GodTube. We believe this benefits you. You can know more about the world around you and, where there are advertisements, they're more likely to be interesting to you. For example, if you put a favorite movie in your profile, we might serve you an advertisement highlighting a screening of a similar one in your town. But we don't tell the movie company who you are.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, GodTube Platform developers and other users of GodTube, to supplement your profile.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (on uploaded video and/or audio content, in comment areas, in messages and public areas such as People, Ministries, Groups and Music areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload videos or send messages through the Site and other Users can contact you through messages and comments. Any videos that you submit to the Site may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels and may be viewed by the general public.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If you are a registered User, we may use your email address or other personally identifiable information without further consent to send commercial or marketing messages to you as part of a general or specific program or feature for which you may or may not have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may also use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of Site changes, changes to the Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, other Company or Site policies and/or for customer service purposes).<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, click stream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Site and to create new features, promotions, functionality and services by storing, tracking and analyzing User preferences and trends.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * We use cookies, clear gifs and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions and status in promotions, sweepstakes and contests.<br>
	<br>
	When Company Discloses Information<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * We may share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) if you are a registered User with third parties for their commercial or marketing use without further consent.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * We do share non-personally-identifiable information for all Users (such as anonymous User usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) for use in advertising by the Company and/or third parties and by and with third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions and/or functionality on the Site.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as <span>U.S</span>. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena or search warrant.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as <span>U.S</span>. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena or search warrant.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Company also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Company believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our website and to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Company, our Users or others.<br>
	<br>
	Your Choices<br>
	<br>
	You may, of course, decline to register as a User and submit personally identifiable information through the Site, in which case Company may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your individual profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page. Please note that media files uploaded by Users to the Site cannot be removed and remain subject to our Terms of Use. You may be able to opt out of certain communications from the Company and/or its partners.<br>
	<br>
	To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.<br>
	<br>
	Please contact Company with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, your personal information, your consent or your opt-in or opt-out choices using this contact form.<br>
	Third-party Advertisers<br>
	<br>
	Advertisements that appear on Sites are sometimes delivered (or “served”) directly to users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and “web beacons” (also known as “1x1 gifs”) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. Company does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on Company’s Sites unless you choose to share it with them. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Company and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.<br>
	<br>
	We use Google, among others, as a third party vendor, and Google in turn uses cookies to serve ads on the Sites. You may opt out of the use of the Google DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy at http://<span>www.google.com</span>/<span>privacy_ads.html</span>.<br>
	Our Commitment to Data Security<br>
	<br>
	Company uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Company and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Company makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical or managerial safeguards.<br>
	<br>
	If Company learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Company may post a notice on the Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us immediately.<br>
	Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy<br>
	<br>
	Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Company does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the Site from persons under 13 years of age without the verified consent and permission of a parent or legal guardian. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Site at any time or in any manner. If Company learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Site, then Company will take prompt and appropriate steps to delete this information. At all times, Company strives to protect children and to provide a family friendly site. Company recommends that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone via the Site and/or Service or otherwise over the Internet.<br>
	<br>
	Special Note to International Users<br>
	<br>
	The Site is hosted in the United States and is intended for and directed to Users in the United States. If you are a User accessing the Site from the European Union, Asia or any other country or region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Site, which is governed by <span>U.S</span>. law, this Privacy Notice and our Terms of Use, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer and the processing of same in the <span>U.S</span>.<br>
	In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy<br>
	<br>
	In the event that Company is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred or used.<br>
	Changes and updates to this Privacy Policy<br>
	<br>
	This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically and at the Company’s sole discretion with such changes becoming effective upon the applicable revision and thereafter. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your ongoing and continuing agreement to this Privacy Policy and any future revisions.</p>
