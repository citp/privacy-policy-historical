</ol>
<blockquote>This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information collected on the Websites
where this Privacy Policy is posted, and, unless Pokémon specifies otherwise in writing, does not
apply to any other information collected by Pokémon through any other means.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and
collected online, and does not apply to information that may be collected by Pokémon offline. This
Privacy Policy applies only to websites maintained by Pokémon, and not to our international
affiliates, or any websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link.
Pokémon is therefore not responsible for the content or activities provided on those
websites.</blockquote>
<blockquote>This Privacy Policy applies to use and sharing of personal information collected as of
the date this Privacy Policy is posted. Finally, the terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to
all applicable laws.</blockquote>

<li>
<a id="12" name="12"></a>What types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our
guests?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>We don't require personal information to access our website. However, if you prefer not
to disclose personal information, you will not be able to enjoy certain features of our website.
Personal information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact
you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>We receive information from our guests and, with our guests' consent, from third
parties such as Pokémon Organized Play ("POP") tournament organizers. We collect personal
information directly from our guests when they: 
<ol>
<li>register on Pokémon's websites</li>
<li>create a wishlist or purchase at one of our online stores</li>
<li>participate in games, reward programs, contests, sweepstakes, events, or promotions</li>
<li>send questions, correspond with us via e-mail concerning their participation in POP or request
customer support</li>
<li>participate in polls, surveys, or questionnaires</li>
<li>use our Email-a-Friend feature</li>
<li>provide us with business information, such as when they apply for or have a special role in POP
(such as Pokémon professors or league or tournament organizers) or seek employment</li>
</ol>Typically, this information includes: 
<ol>
<li>name</li>
<li>email address</li>
<li>telephone number</li>
<li>shipping and billing address, and</li>
<li>for those purchasing products online, credit card information.</li>
</ol>Additionally, we may also collect other types of non-personal information (known as
demographic information) such as your age, gender, dates of birth, hobbies, and toy and game
ownership preferences. This demographic information may be associated with your personal
information.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Business Information (Including Pokémon Professor, League or Tournament Organizer
Applications)</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Personal information submitted to us in a business capacity is not subject to this
Privacy Policy. We treat personal information submitted to us online by persons applying to be or
serving as a POP organizer as information submitted to us in a business capacity. We will share
this personal information with independent third parties who run POP events so that they can
contact the POP organizers about participating in those events and other POP matters. These
independent third parties may not have agreed to abide by the terms of this Privacy
Policy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We also treat personal information submitted to us on-line by job applicants, and by
persons specifying that they are submitting personal information in a business capacity, as
information submitted in a business capacity. Personal information gathered in this context will be
used solely for its intended purpose.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Information Collected Through Technology</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>We collect information through technology to make our websites more interesting and
useful to you. For example, when you come to one of our websites, we collect your IP address. An IP
address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP
(Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university. By itself, your IP address is not
personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the
frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our websites. We may combine this
information with personally identifiable information.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Cookies</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Our Websites also use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a Website sends
to your computer while you are viewing the Website. We and other companies use cookies for a
variety of purposes. For example, when you return to one of our Websites after logging in, cookies
provide information to the Website so that the Website will remember who you are. You can choose to
have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all
cookies. You can do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer)
settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the
correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features
that make your web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services
may not function properly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Web Beacons and Log Files</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Our Websites use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web
beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites.
We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our websites, such as the
frequency with which our users visit various parts of our websites. These technical methods may
involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us
to collect information on our behalf. Our Websites use log files to record which pages visitors to
our site accessed, how long they stayed on the site, where they came from and other data. We also
use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests
have opened those e-mails or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these
technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement or other link and have left our
Websites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the host of
that site to see how your personal information will be handled on their site.</blockquote>

<ol class="header3" start="3">
<li>
<a id="13" name="13"></a>How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>We don't share, sell, or rent your personal information to third parties without your
prior consent. We don't require personal information to access our website. However, if you prefer
not to disclose personal information, you will not be able to enjoy certain features of our
website.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably
necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Pokémon Online Tools and Events</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>For example, if you register on our website, your information will be used to provide
you the benefits associated with registration, including an automatic subscription to our online
store newsletter and the ability to make a purchase through our online store. Any credit card
information is solely used to fulfill and process purchase orders. In addition, if you participate
in a game, contest, sweepstakes, or other similar event ("promotion"), the information provided in
connection with the promotion will be used to determine your entry eligibility, to contact you with
the results, and for prize fulfillment purposes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>POP Participants</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>If you chose to participate in the POP tournament ratings and rankings portion of our
site, 
<a href="http://www.op.pokemon-tcg.com">www.op.pokemon-tcg.com</a>, then we will use your personal
information about you to track your tournament results, Player Ranking, rating, player status
(e.g., active, terminated, winner etc.). If you are 13 and older, we will post your full name or
first name and last initial (as you direct us) and your state and country on our website with your
Player Ranking. If you are under 13, then your parent or guardian can choose to post your username,
full name, or first name and last initial in the Player Rankings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Also if you chose to participate in the POP tournament ratings and rankings portion of
our site, 
<a href="http://www.op.pokemon-tcg.com">www.op.pokemon-tcg.com</a>, we will share your personal
information with independent third parties who run POP events (such as league leaders and
tournament organizers) so that they can run POP events that you may participate in. In most cases,
these are independent third parties and not Pokémon employees. They've agreed to abide by the terms
of this Privacy Policy, but Pokémon cannot guarantee that these independent third parties will
safeguard your personal information. If you don't want your personal information shared with
independent third parties who run offline POP events, then don't apply to participate in the POP
tournament ratings and rankings portion of our site.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Message Boards.</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>If you register for access to our message boards or chat rooms, we will use your
personal information to enable you to view and post messages on the boards. However, you should
understand that community forums and message boards are tools that allow you to communicate with
members of the online community. That's why whenever you give out personal information online in
public areas, that information can be collected and used by people you don't know.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Other sharing</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Occasionally, we may share your personal information with a third party sponsor,
co-sponsor, or other reputable third party that provides products or services that may be of
interest to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Operational Uses</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>We may also use your personal information for other purposes such as "Operational
Uses." For example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications either
about your account with us or about features of our Websites, including any future changes to this
Privacy Policy. If you have selected to receive online marketing communications from our site, your
personal information may be used to send you marketing material about our products and
services.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Internal vendors</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Pokémon may share your personal information with outside entities hired to assist with
internal website support operations (e.g., online product fulfillment, email services, or technical
support). We also provide postal addresses to delivery service companies for delivery purposes. In
the course of providing such services, these companies may have access to your personally
identifying information. These entities have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and
integrity of all the personal information they obtain from us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Aggregate Information</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Finally, we may take your personally identifiable information and make it
non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals
(aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing
characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you
(de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this information, no restrictions apply
under this Privacy Policy on our right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information,
and we may use and share in any way with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable
information.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Purchase or Sale of Businesses</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the event of a merger, sale of assets, acquisition, dissolution, reorganization,
bankruptcy, change of control or other similar event, your personally identifiable information may
be transferred to our successor or assign, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable
law, or if we sell one or more of our businesses, your personally identifiable information may be
transferred as a part of the sale. If we purchase a business, the personally identifiable
information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if
it is practicable and permissible to do so.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our
Websites and Others</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such
disclosures 
<strong>(a)</strong> are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or
subpoena, or 
<strong>(b)</strong> will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes,
promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security
of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of our Websites or third
parties.</blockquote>

<h5>Last updated March 24, 2009</h5>
<h2 align="center" style="clear: both;">OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT</h2>
<p>Pokémon has developed its websites with the goal of creating an enjoyable experience for all
users. This Kids Privacy Policy is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies
and principles with respect to children under the age of 13.</p>
<p>Building on our general Privacy Policy, we recognize the need to provide additional privacy
protections when children visit the sites on which this Kids' Privacy Policy is posted. We explain
those additional protections in this Kids' Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal
guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years
of age; and that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13
years of age to use certain features of our Web sites. Below we explain how we do that for these
"kids." Also, when we use the term "parent" below, we mean to include legal guardians.</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement and the certification seal shown on this page confirm that Pokémon USA,
Inc. is a member in good standing of ESRB's Privacy Online Program. ESRB's Privacy Online Program
is designed to ensure that our website's information disclosure practices are responsible and
appropriate. To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and
all of our websites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established
online information collection and use practices. As part of this privacy program, we are subject to
frequent audits of our websites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered
independently by the ESRB.</p>
<p>Pokémon is a self-certified member of the U.S. Department of Commerce's EU Safe Harbor privacy
program jointly established to comply with the European Commission's 1998 Directive on Data
Protection. For more information about this privacy initiative, visit the Department of Commerce's

<blockquote>Note that all commercial sites directed to children under 13 are prohibited by U.S. law
from conditioning a kid's participation in an online activity on the kid's providing more personal
information than is reasonably necessary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Some areas of our website offer features like electronic postcards that allow kids to
submit personal information (e.g., email address) without first disclosing their age or obtaining
verifiable parental consent. These areas of our website provide services in a way that doesn't
require prior verifiable parental consent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Finally, we may collect demographic information about a kid. For example, if a kid
participates in a survey, we may collect those responses. Among them, we may collect age, gender,
hobbies, and interests or other demographic information about gaming and preferences. We also use
some passive technologies, including cookies and web beacons, to monitor traffic on our websites.
This demographic information may be associated with a child's personal information.</blockquote>

collect from kids?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>We may collect personal information from parents to allow kids to participate in
certain activities offered on our websites and within our kids' subscription products. These
activities may include participating in games, reward programs, contests, sweepstakes, events or
other promotions; purchasing in one of our on line stores or creating a wishlist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We may use your child's information to allow your child to send questions or request
customer support. We may also use your child's information to participate in polls, surveys or
questionnaires. We may also use that information to send your child email and messages with
promotional information about new products and features, special offers, and other interesting
events concerning new products, events and other information about Pokémon.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Other website features include sending e-mail message to "tell-a- friend" and product
ratings. If a parent allows us to collect personal information about their kid, we may link certain
information collected through technology (see the "Information Collected Through Technology"
section of A2 of our General Privacy Policy) to that personal information.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We may use the information that we collect from and about kids for our business
purposes, including record-keeping, transaction fulfillment, and marketing. The contact information
gathered from a kid is used to obtain consent to our information collection from their
parents.</blockquote>
<blockquote>After registration, contact information may also be used to notify users of promotional
activities such as contests, sweepstakes, newsletters or new products, or functional changes to our
website or privacy policy. Finally, we may use personal and demographic information for our
internal marketing and study ways to better improve our services.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If a kid wins a sweepstakes, contest or other promotional event if we have not already
collected the parent's consent, we notify the parent at the email address provided to us during the
registration process, and request that the parent provide his or her postal address for purposes of
delivering the prize. We may publish a winner's first name, city, and state of residence on our web
site.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If you allow your child to participate in the POP tournament ratings and rankings
portion of our site, 
<a href="http://www.op.pokemon-tcg.com">www.op.pokemon-tcg.com</a>, then we will use personal
information about your child to track your child's tournament results, Player Ranking, rating,
player status (e.g., active, terminated, winner etc.). As parent or guardian, you can choose to
post your child's username, full name, or first name and last initial, in the Player
Rankings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Also if you chose to allow your child to participate in the POP tournament ratings and
rankings portion of our site, www.op.pokemon-tcg.com, we will share your personal information with
independent third parties who run POP events (such as league leaders and tournament organizers) so
that they can run POP events that you may participate in. In most cases, these are independent
third parties and not Pokémon employees. They've agreed to abide by the terms of this Privacy
Policy, but Pokémon cannot guarantee that these independent third parties will safeguard your
personal information. If you don't want your personal information shared with independent third
parties who run offline POP events, then don't apply to participate in the POP tournament ratings
and rankings portion of our site.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Pokémon may share kids' personal information with outside entities hired to assist with
internal website support operations (e.g., online product fulfillment, email services, or technical
support). These entities have agreed to maintain confidentiality, security, and integrity of all
the personal information they obtain from us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We do not share any information about a child with any third parties unless the
disclosure is reasonably necessary to: 
<ul class="styled">
<li>comply with law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena;</li>
<li>enforce our Terms of Service, or site or game/promotion rules;</li>
<li>in connection with the purchase or sale of assets, a merger, reorganization, bankruptcy or
similar corporate transaction; or</li>

personal information from their kids?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>When a child under the age of 13 attempts to register with our website, we send their
parent an e-mail notifying them that their child would like to register, and asking them to visit
our website to grant consent for their child to register. If the parent ignores or refuses to
register their child, we will delete all contact information from our database. If the parent
permits the registration, their child will be granted access to the features described in the
notification e-mail.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Alternatively, your child can download and print a parental consent form. Then, you, as
the parent, can fill out and sign the parental consent form and mail or fax it to Pokémon or an
authorized third-party, like a Tournament or League Organizer. These parental consent forms may
also be available at Pokémon Organized Play and other Pokémon events.</blockquote>

seriously. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect
children's personal information from unauthorized access and improper use. To prevent unauthorized
electronic access to personal information, we limit access to only those employees performing a
legitimate business function; maintain information collected online behind a firewall-protected
server; verify your and/or your child’s identity by asking for an email address or by other means;
store your and/or your child’s personal information on servers separate from other corporate
information and systems; and notify you and/or your child by email if we learn that a breach has
occurred. From time to time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new
technology and methods. However, please understand that, despite our best efforts, no security
measure is perfect or impenetrable.</blockquote>
