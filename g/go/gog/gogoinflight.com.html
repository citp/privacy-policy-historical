We may, and you hereby authorize us to, disclose your Personal Information (including your Account Information) and your communications through the Service, if required by law or by law enforcement officers acting under the color of law, or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect or defend the rights, property, or safety of Aircell, you, other users, or third parties (especially in emergency situations).</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p align="justify" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: " times="" new="" roman";"=""> <strong>Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information</strong> </p>      <p align="justify" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: " times="" new="" roman";"="">We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Information. When you receive promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further promotional communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the promotional e-mail you receive or by contacting us directly (please see contact information below).</p>      <p align="justify" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: " times="" new="" roman";"="">Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you administrative e-mails regarding the Service, including, for example, purchase confirmation, account creation confirmation, and notices of updates to our Terms of Use Agreement or Privacy Policy. You may change any of your Account Information by editing it in your account page. You may request deletion of your Account Information by us, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request, only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete Account Information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives.</p>      <p align="justify" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: " times="" new="" roman";"=""> <strong>Third Party Content and Ads</strong> </p>      <p align="justify" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: " times="" new="" roman";"="">We may enable certain third parties (such as the Wall Street Journal Digest) to deliver content and ads on the Site.

In addition, we use standard Wi-Fi protocols for transmission of data on the Service. You should know that unauthorized persons may attempt to intercept your network communications.
