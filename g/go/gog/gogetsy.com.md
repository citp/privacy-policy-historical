### Information Collection and How it is Used

### General Information:

  * Etsy will not sell or disclose your name or email address to third parties without your explicit consent, except as specified in this privacy policy.
  * Your username, Etsy ID or alias is displayed throughout Etsy (and so available to the public) and is connected to all of your Etsy activity. Other people can see your items for sale, store, feedback, ratings and associated comments. You have the option to publicly display your full name.
  * Etsy collects personal information when you register to use Etsy services or to post content on Etsy. At registration you are asked for your email address and certain other optional information.
  * If you would like to obtain a Seller account, Etsy will ask for your billing address, phone number, and credit card information.
  * Etsy automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookies, and the pages you request. This data is only used in the aggregate.
  * Etsy uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provisioning, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, research, and anonymous reporting. IP addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. Your IP address is stored in Etsy's user registration databases when you register with Etsy. IP addresses may be used for various research purposes.



### Service-related Announcements

Etsy will send you a welcome/confirmation email when you sign up for Etsy's services. Receipt of this email is required for using Etsy's services.

Etsy will send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.

You may not opt-out of service-related communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account by emailing support@etsy.com from the email address you signed up with.

### Administrative Messages

Etsy may periodically email you with administrative messages. Etsy will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. Your information may be combined with information Etsy collects from other companies and used to improve and personalize services, content and advertising. If you don't wish to receive administrative messages or participate in these programs, simply opt-out by emailing support@etsy.com.

### Newsletter Emails

Etsy offers subscriptions to Etsy email newsletters. To opt-in, Etsy will ask for your email address and the newsletter(s) you wish to receive. This email address will only be used for this feature. You may change your subscription or unsubscribe at anytime by following the instructions contained in the email.

### Friend Features

"Tell a Friend" allows members to share information about a specific item listed on Etsy by sending a personalized email message. If you choose to use Etsy's "Tell a Friend" feature, Etsy will ask for the information needed to send the message, such as your friend's email address. Etsy will then automatically send your friend an email, inviting your friend to visit the site. Etsy does not store "Tell a Friend" information on our servers. Your friend may utilize the "unsubscribe" link in the email to opt-out of receiving future "Tell a Friend" emails from Etsy.

We utilize a contact-importer feature to help you identify people from your email address books who are current members of Etsy and invite any other contact to join Etsy. You may connect directly with your email service provider and import your contacts to Etsy. When you add contacts to your Etsy circle, they will automatically receive an email notification. When you invite contacts to join Etsy, you may preview the email invitation before Etsy generates and sends it. Recipients of invitations may opt out of receiving future invitations via a convenient link located in the invitation email. If you do not want your contacts to be able to find your Etsy username through your email address, you may opt out through your account privacy settings.

### Choice/Opt-out

If you no longer wish to receive administrative messages, you may opt-out by emailing support@etsy.com. Please note that if you do not wish to receive administrative messages from us, those notices will still govern your use of the Etsy website and service, and you are responsible for reviewing such notices for changes.

### Cookies

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Etsy products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of the Etsy service. Etsy uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to: Access your information when you "sign in"; keep track of preferences you specify while you are using Etsy's services; display the most appropriate advertising banners, based on your interests and activity on Etsy; estimate and report Etsy's total audience size and traffic; conduct research to improve Etsy's content and services. Etsy cookies do not collect personal information, and Etsy does not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your username or email address is.

### Tracking Technologies

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to your personally identifiable information. The use of cookies by our third party tracking partners is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners use session ID cookies to support our site functionality such as web analytics reporting.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

When you post a message, your Etsy ID or alias is visible to other users. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Etsy may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the Etsy Terms of Use. Etsy may disclose personally identifiable information to parties in compliance with Etsy's Copyright and Intellectual Property Policy, as Etsy in Etsy's sole discretion believes necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. In such events, Etsy may disclose name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email address and company name. Etsy may share aggregated demographic information with business partners.

Etsy is affiliated with a variety of businesses and works closely with them. These businesses may operate stores on the Etsy website or sell items to you from the Etsy website. Etsy may also provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. Due to the nature of Etsy's business model, when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, you will share customer information that is related to such transaction with that affiliated business.

Etsy employs other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and needs to share your information with them to provide products and services to you. Examples include but are not limited to fulfilling orders, handling billing disputes and collections, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service.

Etsy will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with nonaffiliated parties except as specified in this Privacy Policy to provide products or services you have requested or when Etsy has your permission. It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Etsy's Terms of Use, as specified in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by law. In some cases, Etsy may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Etsy will transfer information about you if Etsy is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Etsy web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

As part of the buying and selling process, you may obtain another Etsy user's email address, shipping address and/or other information. Pursuant to Etsy's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use this information. This information should only be used for Etsy-related communications or for Etsy-facilitated transactions. Etsy has not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages. Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent from the user, you are not licensed to add any Etsy user to your email or physical mail list.

Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and Etsy's ability to keep the community free from bad actors, Etsy will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order, legal process, or substantially similar legal procedure, except when Etsy believes in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to protect Etsy's rights, prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or to report suspected illegal activity.

### Forums / Chat Rooms

If you use a forum or chat room on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by others or could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Etsy is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

### Third Parties

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information Etsy collects from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are buyers or sellers on Etsy or throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Etsy does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. Etsy is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other websites on the Internet, even those linked to or from the Etsy site. Etsy encourages you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

### Editing and Deleting Account Information

You can change your Etsy Account Information (except your username), at any time. Etsy may send you certain communications relating to the Etsy service, such as service-related announcements and administrative messages that are considered part of your Etsy account. You can delete your Etsy account by emailing support@etsy.com. Please note that your identification, billing and contact information may remain in Etsy's records for some period.

Etsy limits access to personal information about you to employees who Etsy believes reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. Your Etsy Account Information is password-protected.

If your personally identifiable information changes you may correct or update it by making the change on Your Etsy Page. You may delete or deactivate your account by emailing Customer Support at support@etsy.com or by postal mail at the contact information listed below. Etsy will respond to your request within 10-20 business days.

### Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. Your Etsy account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) for registration Etsy encrypts that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Etsy follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once Etsy receives it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while Etsy strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, Etsy cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on Etsy's Web site, you can email Etsy at support@etsy.com.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

If the privacy policy is changed, Etsy will post changes so that you are aware of those changes. Etsy reserves the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If Etsy makes material changes to this policy you will be notified here, by email, or other places Etsy deems appropriate.
