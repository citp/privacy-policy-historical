### **Data Controller vs. Processor; Our Legal Bases for Using Your Information**

Under applicable law, GoGuardian is considered the "data controller" of information from or about our Website visitors. In other words, GoGuardian is responsible for deciding how to collect, use, share, and disclose this information.

The laws of some jurisdictions such as the laws of the European Union (" **EU** ") require companies to tell you about about the legal ground that they rely on for using, sharing, or disclosing your information. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:

  * **_Contractual Commitments:_** We may use, share, or disclose information to honor our contractual commitments to you. For example, to comply with our [Website Terms](https://www.goguardian.com/terms.html), which you accept by browsing our otherwise using our Website.
  * **_With Your Consent:_** Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the basis of your consent.
  * **_Legitimate Interests:_** In many cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, certain promotional activities, analyzing and improving our business, providing security for our Website, preventing fraud, and managing legal issues.
  * **_Legal Compliance:_** We need to use, share, and disclose information in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.



### **How Long We Keep Information**

We generally retain information for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes above. To dispose of any personal information, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Information may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for an additional time period of time.

### **Your Choices**

You have certain rights and choices with respect to your information such as:

  * **_Marketing Communications:_** You can decline promotional communications at the point information is requested for such purpose on our Website (e.g., by checking or un-ticking (as directed) the relevant box) or, by following the unsubscribe instructions on communications sent to you. You can also contact us as described in the "How to Contact Us" section below.
  * **_Cookies & Analytics._** You can opt out of certain cookie-related and analytics processing by following the instructions in our Cookie Notice below. 
  * **_California Rights:_** Under California law, California residents may annually request a list of the third parties to which we disclose personal information for such third parties' marketing purposes and the types of information disclosed. However, we do not disclose personal information to third parties for such third parties' direct marketing purposes.
  * **_Do Not Track:_** Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.
  * **_Your Legal Rights Under Local Law:_**
    * Your local laws (e.g., laws of the EU) may permit you to request that we: 
      * provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you;
      * prevent the processing of your information for direct-marketing purposes; (including any direct marketing processing based on profiling)
      * update information which is out of date or incorrect;
      * delete certain information that we are holding about you;
      * restrict the way that we process and disclose certain of your information;
      * transfer your information to a third party provider of services; and
      * revoke your consent for the processing of your information.
  * **_Note About Do Not Track:_** Do Not Track ("DNT"): is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Some browsers do not recognize DNT settings. At this time, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals because we do not track you across websites.



We will consider all of your requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include needing to continue processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to your request.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us as described in the "How to Contact Us" section below. In addition to those rights, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority.
