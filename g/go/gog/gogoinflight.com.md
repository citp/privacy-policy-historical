# Gogo Inflight Internet - Privacy Policy

**Gogo Inflight Internet Service Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy (the “ **Privacy Policy** ”) is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information through the Service (and associated Site) and at www.gogoinflight.com. Aircell LLC (“ **Aircell** ”, “ **us** ” or “ **we** ”) operates the Service. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms set forth in the Terms of Use Agreement (available at www.gogoinflight.com/terms ) for the Service.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information collected via the Aircell corporate website (www.aircell.com), other than information related to registration for the Service. The airlines on whose planes the Service is available do not collect any information through your use of the Service, but we may share certain types of information with such airlines, as described below.

**Certain Definitions**

“ **Contact Information** ” means information that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, and email address.

“ **Personal Information** ” is any information about you that is associated with or linked to your Contact Information.

“ **Account Information** ” means Personal Information that we collect during your registration for the Service, including your name, e-mail address and e-mail preferences, password for your Account and password hint question, mailing address, billing address, and complete set of credit card information that enables us to receive your payment (including credit card authorization number – we do not retain your credit card number). Account Information includes Personal Information we receive (if any) from any Roaming Partner with which you have registered or any airline partner (collectively, “ **Partners** ”). We may also ask you to provide additional information on an optional basis in connection with setting up your Account.

“ **Anonymous Information** ” means information that is not associated with or linked to your Contact Information; Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons.

**User Consent**

By using the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy.

**If you are a User who resides outside the United States, you understand that your Personal Information may be processed in countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.**

**Personal Information You Provide to Us**

When you register to use the Service, we collect your Account Information. When you leave us feedback, we will collect any information that is contained in your feedback. When you contact us by sending us an e-mail, fax, or letter, we will collect your address, fax number, or e-mail address and any information contained in the e-mail, fax, or letter you send us. We record any e-chat sessions you have with us or our service providers.

**Personal Information Collected via Technology**

As you use the Service, certain information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We may also store a small text file called a “Cookie” on your computer to store certain information about your Account. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). We may include web beacons with the content and ads that we deliver to you, which we use to collect information regarding your interaction with such content and ads. We will also collect the MAC address of the wireless device that you are using to access our Service. We may associate your MAC address with your Personal Information.

The “ **Media Access Control Address** ” or “ **MAC Address** ” is an identifier attached to a network adapter, such as you wireless (WiFi) card, device, or component. An “ **Internet protocol address** ” or “ **IP Address** ” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We assign your computer or device a dynamic IP Address that varies from session to session when you use the Service.

**Personal Information from Other Sources**

We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources, like our Partners or other third parties. We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you.

**Use of Information**

We use your Personal Information to provide the Service to you, to respond to requests that you make, to improve the Service, and to better tailor the features, performance, and support of the Service. We track IP Addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page flow. We may use records of e-chat sessions for support, training, and improvements to our Service.

We may use your Personal Information to send you electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails, unless you have requested not to receive such promotional communications from us. We may also use your Personal Information to send you Service-related communications, for which you may opt out if you terminate your Account.

We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding Contact Information (which makes the information personally identifiable to you). We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information at our discretion.

**Feedback**

If you provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any purpose, provided we do not associate such feedback with your Contact Information.

**Disclosure of Personal Information**

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not trade, rent, or share your Personal Information with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.

If you are a Roaming Partner User, we may send to the applicable Roaming Partner: (a) the userID and password you submit to us when you sign in to use the Service in order to authenticate you and for security purposes; and (b) information regarding the times that you started and stopped use of the Service and bandwidth used. We may also disclose your Personal Information to our airline Partners.

We may provide your Personal Information to third party service providers who work on behalf of or with us to provide the Service. However, these service providers do not have any independent right to share this information (except pursuant to a legal requirement such as a subpoena or warrant).

We may share some or all of your Personal Information with our Affiliates (“ **Affiliates** ” are parent companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control) in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.

If our company or our assets related to this Privacy Policy are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Law Enforcement Compliance**

We may be required by law, or by law enforcement officers acting under the color of law, to record some or all of your communications on or through the Service. We may, and you hereby authorize us to, disclose your Personal Information (including your Account Information) and your communications through the Service, if required by law or by law enforcement officers acting under the color of law, or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect or defend the rights, property, or safety of Aircell, you, other users, or third parties (especially in emergency situations).

**Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information**

We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Information. When you receive promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further promotional communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the promotional e-mail you receive or by contacting us directly (please see contact information below).

Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you administrative e-mails regarding the Service, including, for example, purchase confirmation, account creation confirmation, and notices of updates to our Terms of Use Agreement or Privacy Policy. You may change any of your Account Information by editing it in your account page. You may request deletion of your Account Information by us, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request, only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete Account Information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives.

**Third Party Content and Ads**

We may enable certain third parties (such as the Wall Street Journal Digest) to deliver content and ads on the Site. These third parties may collect (via tracking technologies like cookies or web beacons) and use Anonymous Information regarding your interaction with the content or ads that they deliver and with which you interact.

**Regarding Children**

We do not intentionally gather Personal Information about Users who are under the age of 13.

**Other Sites**

Our provision of links to other websites or locations is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other websites or location or its contents. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of our Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites.

**Security**

We make reasonable efforts to protect the information contained in your Account, but no company, including Aircell, can fully eliminate security risks connected to handling information on the internet. In addition, we use standard Wi-Fi protocols for transmission of data on the Service. You should know that unauthorized persons may attempt to intercept your network communications. We encourage you to exercise caution in accessing Wi-Fi hotspots; the only Aircell-authorized access point on each plane will have an SSID labeled “gogoinflight”.
