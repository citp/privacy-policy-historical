Please check these policies before you submit any personal information to their websites.</p>

            <h2>4. Use of Internet</h2>

            <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure.

            We reserve the right to transfer ownership of the website (including personal information you submit) to a third party in the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of us, a subsidiary or line of business associated with us.</p>

This is to prevent third parties from gaining unauthorised access to a user’s account and is for users’ own protection.<br><br>

            You should note that technical details which we cannot associate with any identifiable individual do not constitute "personal data" for the purposes of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.<br><br>
