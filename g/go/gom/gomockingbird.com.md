# Mockingbird | Wireframes on the fly | Privacy Policy

#### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, GoMockingbird.com (“Mockingbird”) collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Mockingbird’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Mockingbird’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Mockingbird may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Mockingbird also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Mockingbird does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

#### Information Gathering

We ask visitors who sign up for an account to provide a valid email address. Those who engage in transactions with Mockingbird – by purchasing premium Mockingbird accounts, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Mockingbird collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Mockingbird. Mockingbird does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

#### Aggregated Statistics

Mockingbird may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Mockingbird may monitor the types of widgets most used in mockups made by visitors. Mockingbird may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Mockingbird does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

#### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Mockingbird discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Mockingbird’s behalf or to provide services available at Mockingbird’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Mockingbird will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone, except in the following cases: 

  * when required to do so by law
  * or when Mockingbird believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Mockingbird, third parties or the public at large.



If you are a registered user of Mockingbird and have supplied your email address, Mockingbird may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Mockingbird and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Mockingbird takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

#### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Mockingbird uses cookies to help Mockingbird identify and track visitors, their usage of Mockingbird’s website, and their website access preferences. Mockingbird visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers may set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Mockingbird, with the drawback that certain features of Mockingbird’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

#### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Mockingbird may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Mockingbird’s sole discretion. Mockingbird encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
