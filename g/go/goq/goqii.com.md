# Welcome to GOQii Life

#### Our Policy

* We, GOQii (collectively used to refer to GOQii Inc., GOQii Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and its affiliates, successors and assigns) bring to you a digital health and fitness subscription service that combines one-on-one mobile personal coaching and fitness tracking technology to help you shift to a healthier lifestyle and reach your goals. While fitness trackers and apps are useful tools, they are missing the elements of on-going engagement, motivation and accountability. GOQii solves this by connecting your activity tracker or smart watch to a professional health and fitness coach of your choice via the “GOQii App” (available on iOS and Android) and a wearable GOQii fitness band (" **GOQii Tracker** "). You can read more about GOQii and our product at website [goqii.com](https://goqii.com/) (together with the GOQii App is hereby referred to as the " **Platform** "). For ease of reading and clarity, the Platform, the GOQii App and the GOQii Tracker are collectively referred to as the " **Services** ". Your use of the Platform and Services are governed by the Terms of Use and other policies of GOQii.

We know that the privacy of your personal data is very important to you. This Privacy Policy sets forth GOQii’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (" **Personal Data** ") and other information that is collected from Platform visitors and users.

In operating this Platform, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Platform gives to your browser when you access the Platform. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Platform and help us analyze Platform usage more accurately.

In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Platform’s features.

his Platform may enable the use of the Adobe Flash Player. Adobe’s Flash Player is used by the vast majority of websites that offer video and other interactive content. By default, your use of the Adobe Flash Player generates “flash cookies” (also known as “persistent identification elements” or “local shared objects”). The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use flash cookies to remember user settings, preferences and usage similar to the browser cookies referenced above. You can disable, delete and control the degree to which you accept flash cookies by accessing your Adobe Flash Player management tools directly through the settings manager for Adobe Flash, located here.
