## Privacy Policy

**Collection of Information**

We collect personal information that is important for the purpose of giving our services on the website i.e. to enable individuals to collect and manage your bookmarks, share what you like and build an online reputation based on the reputation of the content shared. We do not possess this information in a way that is incompatible with our business purpose. The information collected from our users is as below:

**1\. Information You Provide to Us:**

We store information that we receive from you while registering for our services or provide in any other way for example by connecting via other social networking services e.g. Facebook, Twitter etc. You can choose not to provide additional information other than what is mandatory but that would result in our inability to serve you to the full.

In order to register, you can complete the registration form available on our website or connect via third party services like Facebook or twitter. Based on the permissions granted by you on these services, we can automatically pull your information that is relevant to us. The basic information include: First Name, Last Name, your photo, email address and date of birth. 

User Profile: To allow you to express yourself beyond just the information collected during registration; we enable you to provide additional information, such as a bio, favorite URLs, social networking URL's for LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook.
