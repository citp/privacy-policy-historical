# Privacy Policy

**Introduction**

This privacy policy is designed to inform users of the Gobza website (www.gobza.com), mobile applications, microsites, software and service (collectively, the “Service”) about how Tops Global, Inc., doing business as Gobza (“Gobza”, “we” or “us”), gathers and uses personal information collected by us in connection with use of the Service. Gobza will take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and with applicable U.S. laws. In this policy, “user” or “you” means any person using the Service, whether by browsing the Gobza website or mobile apps, purchasing a Gobza promotional voucher (“Vouchers”) that may be exchanged for goods and services offered by Gobza merchants (each a “Merchant”), uploading or exchanging a Voucher, or participating in any other activities available through the Service. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR WEBSITE TERMS OF SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.

**First Up, We Want You to Know This**

We will never disclose your email address to any user (including Merchants) or any other third party for their marketing purposes. This allows you to use Gobza without receiving a whole lot of direct marketing you don't want.

**What Information Do We Collect?**

When you sign up to create a Gobza account, purchase a Voucher, submit content to Gobza, complete a survey, send us feedback, request information about the Service, apply for a job, post a video, or sign up for special offers from third parties, Gobza may collect personal information from you, such as your email address, first and last name, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information (collectively, “Personal Information”) when you, for example:

  * submit or post content to Gobza,
  * participate in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games or applications,
  * create, or engage in discussions in, forums or message boards,
  * send us feedback or request information about the Service, or

_Information Others Share_. [We may also receive information about you from other people who use the Service and submit or post content about you in a forum or message board].

_Web Tracking Information_ : Gobza and its third party service providers may use web tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs, to collect data related to usage of the Service, the Vouchers and web and email marketing conducted by or on behalf of Gobza.
