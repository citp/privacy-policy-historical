Refer to the Official Rules and Privacy Policy for each individual sweepstakes for Go Banking Rates’s specific policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to sweepstakes entry.</p><h2>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</h2><p>Many of the features of www.GoBankingRates.com are available to you without your providing personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information generally includes information that could be used to determine your identity, such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and birth date. The following are certain situations in which Go Banking Rates may collect personally identifiable information from you:</p><ul style="list-style:disc; margin-left:3em; padding:0"><li><strong>Registration for Newsletters and Sweepstakes.</strong> Go Banking Rates collects personally identifiable information from you if you register online for one of Go Banking Rates’s newsletters and when you enter Go Banking Rates’s sweepstakes. When you register online with Go Banking Rates, Go Banking Rates asks for personally identifiable information like your name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, ZIP code, occupation, industry, personal interests and other demographic information.</li><li><strong>Use of Forums.</strong> If you choose to transmit, submit or post information through Go Banking Rates’s chat rooms, bulletin boards or other forums (the “Forums”), Go Banking Rates will collect that information you provide. Go Banking Rates retains this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law and pursuant to Go Banking Rates’s Terms of Use.</li><li><strong>Forms.</strong> Go Banking Rates may collect personally identifiable information from you if you choose to fill out any forms, profiles, or surveys on www.GoBankingRates.com.</li><li><strong>Correspondence.</strong> If you send Go Banking Rates personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send Go Banking Rates correspondence about your activities or postings on www.GoBankingRates.com, Go Banking Rates may choose to collect such information into a file specific to you.</li><li><strong>Business Partners</strong> Go Banking Rates may receive your personally identifiable information from one of Go Banking Rates’s business partners.</li></ul><h2 style="margin-top:1em">Use of Personally Identifiable Information</h2><p>Go Banking Rates uses your personally identifiable information as follows:</p><ul style="list-style:disc; margin-left:3em; padding:0"><li>to improve Go Banking Rates’s marketing and promotional efforts, analyze site usage, improve Go Banking Rates’s content and product offerings, and customize Go Banking Rates’s content, layout, and services;</li><li>to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of www.GoBankingRates.com;</li><li>to fulfill your requests for certain products and services;</li><li>for market research, project planning, troubleshooting problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity, to enforce Go Banking Rates’s Terms of Use, for other internal purposes, and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection; and</li><li>as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.</li></ul><div class="subb" style="margin:1em 0"><h1>Policy and the Terms of Use</h1></div><h2>Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information</h2><p>Unless you are entering one of Go Banking Rates’s sweepstakes, Go Banking Rates does not currently sell your personally identifiable information. The following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business:</p><ul style="list-style:disc; margin-left:3em; padding:0"><li><strong>Advertisers.</strong> Go Banking Rates may aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. For example, Go Banking Rates may aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose it to network advertisers in a non-personally identifiable manner as set forth in the section entitled “Network Advertisers,” set forth below.</li><li><strong>External Service Providers.</strong> There are a number of separate services offered by third parties, including, without limitation, Go Banking Rates’s affiliates, that Go Banking Rates refers to as external service providers that may be complementary to your use of www.GoBankingRates.com (e.g. realtors, mortgage brokers, lenders, financial institutions, credit card issuers, information aggregators). If you choose to use these separate services, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy. With your consent, Go Banking Rates may provide some of your personal information to the external service provider offering such services, for your convenience. To prevent Go Banking Rates’s disclosure of your personally identifiable information to an external service provider, you can decline such consent or simply not use their services. You should evaluate the practices of external services providers before deciding to use their services.</li><li><strong>Internal Service Providers.</strong> Go Banking Rates may use third parties that Go Banking Rates refers to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of Go Banking Rates’s business, product and service operations that Go Banking Rates provides to you (e.g., technology, Forums, newsletters/alerts, analytical tools, advertising campaign management) and therefore Go Banking Rates may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with Go Banking Rates or other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information Go Banking Rates provides them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced Go Banking Rates related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In some instances, the internal service provider may collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personally identifiable information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.<br> Personally identifiable information and other personal information collected from you may also be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization, other transfer or bankruptcy (a “Transfer”) involving Go Banking Rates and/or its affiliates. Go Banking Rates specifically reserves the right to transfer personally identifiable information collected from www.GoBankingRates.com, and any of its databases, together with any personally identifiable information contained therein, to a third party in connection with a Transfer, and nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Go Banking Rates to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets (including www.GoBankingRates.com) to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever.</li><li><strong>Network Advertising.</strong> Go Banking Rates may use third-party advertising companies for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you. Using third-party advertising companies helps us and third-party advertisers better determine which advertisements or content to serve to you. For example, the third-party advertisers may use information regarding your visits to www.GoBankingRates.com and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services, that third party advertisers believe will be of interest to you.</li></ul><p>The types of information that may be collected by third-party advertising companies include the following:</p><ul style="list-style:disc; margin-left:3em; padding:0;"><li>the type of Internet browser you use;</li><li>the type of computer operating system you use;</li><li>the domain name of a Web site you visit, as well as information related to Web sites and Web pages you are viewing when an advertisement is requested;</li><li>whether or not you visit specific pages of www.GoBankingRates.com or other Web sites;</li><li>the location of your Internet service provider’s point of presence;</li><li>the date and time of a visit to a Web site;</li><li>search keywords passed from another server;</li><li>the number of times you have clicked on an advertisement; and</li><li>other interactions between you and a Web site.</li></ul><p>If you would like to opt-out of third-party advertising companies’ use of such information, go to <a href="http://www.savingssavy.info/unsubscribe">www.SavingsSavy.info/unsubscribe</a></p><h2>Newsletters and CAN-SPAM Compliance</h2><p>GoBankingRates.com sends only verified newsletters, specifically requested by Go Banking Rates subscribers.
