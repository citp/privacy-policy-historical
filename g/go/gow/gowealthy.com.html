                    A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer 
                    tied to information about the user. Gowealthy uses cookies 
                    to manage the user state. Gowealthy does not use any persistent 
                    cookies. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally 
                    identifiable information while on our site. We use only session 
                    ID cookies for the session ID cookie, once users close the 
                    browser, the cookie simply terminates. If users reject the 
                    cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to 
                    this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our

                    referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and 
                    number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track 
                    user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic

                    what information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
                    circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information 
                    in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information

                    we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying 
                    users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice
