                  let us know. Send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@allriserecords.com">info@GotVape.com.</a></p>
                <p><b>What information does Got Vape? collect from me?</b></p>
                <p>During registration we ask for your name, company name, address, 
                  zip/postal code, email address, phone, age. In addition to the 
                  information we obtain at registration, we may ask you for information 
                  at other times, such as when you make a purchase or register 
                  for a service on www.gotvape.com Web site, when you submit a 
                  listing for a Web site, or when you report a problem with one 
                  of our services or the site(s) of our strategic alliance companies. 
                </p><p>If you contact Got Vape? we may keep a record of that correspondence 
                  or communication. Information on how you communicated with us 
                  may also be recorded and can include your Internet address, 
                  the language you selected for viewing order forms or other documents, 
                  your browser type, the currency in which you viewed prices if 
                  such feature is available, your use of a secure or insecure 
                  Web page, the return email address shown in any email message 
                  from you, the return address on any envelope or facsimile number 
                  on any facsimile, or the telephone number from which you called.<br>
                  <br>
                  Got Vape? also may occasionally ask you to provide information 
                  to participate in certain voluntary promotions, surveys, or 
                  contests (see the Sponsors/Contests/Surveys section below). 
                  Finally, Got Vape? collects information about its Members in 
                  general, which does not necessarily identify the Member, by 
                  using our server log files and some of the methods described 
                  in the "cookies" section below. </p>
                <p><b>Why does Got Vape? gather this information, and how is it 
                  used?</b></p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li> When you order a product or service we use your name, email 
                    address, delivery address, and credit card number and expiration 
                    date (or financial information) as part of a credit check. 
                    This information allows us to process the order and deliver 
                    the product or service. 
                  </li><li>We ask for your telephone number to enable us to contact 
                    you if there is a problem with your order or the delivery 
                    of a product or service. In the event you have asked for the 
                    delivery of tangible goods, we may need to share the telephone 
                    number with the carrier delivering the goods. 
                  </li><li> When you order a product or service from a company linked 
                    to the www.gotvape.com Web site, it may be necessary for Got 
                    Vape? to share certain limited information, such as your IP 
                    address, with such company in order to process and complete 
                    your purchase or other transaction. In such cases, Got Vape? 
                    shares the minimum information necessary to complete the transaction 
                    and only shares such information when you make a purchase 
                    or engage in a transaction - not when you simply visit and 
                    leave the other site. 
                  </li><li> If you choose to enter a contest or other promotion, we 
                    ask for your name, address, email address, and other information 
                    in order to notify winners. As noted in the rules of the contest 
                    or promotion, we may publish certain information about the 
                    winners. <br>
                  </li><li> In addition to using your information to deliver services 
                    requested by you, Got Vape? may use the information to notify 
                    you about important service issues, functionality changes, 
                    and other customer support issues. If you choose, Got Vape? 
                    will also notify you about special offers and services from 
                    Got Vape? that we believe you will find valuable. <br>
                  </li><li> We also use the information you provide us to enhance the 
                    operation of the www.gotvape.com Web site and to provide you 
                    a customized experience when you navigate through our site. 
                    <br>
                  </li><li> Finally, we analyze our users' demographics, interests, 
                    and behavior based on the information provided to us through 
                    the www.gotvape.com Web site. Our research and analysis is 
                    done on an aggregate basis and is not intended to identify 
                    individual Members. <br>
                </li></ul>
                <b>What about third party sites linked to the www.gotvape.com 
                Web site or strategic alliance companies?</b> 
                <p>Certain products and services offered through the www.gotvape.com 
                  Web site are made available by other companies with which Got 
                  Vape? has a strategic alliance. To obtain some of these products 
                  and services you may be on the other company's Web site or a 
                  site they share with Got Vape?. When ordering, registering for, 
                  or purchasing products or services from these other companies, 
                  you will be entering into an agreement with that company, not 
                  with Got Vape?. In these cases, this privacy policy does not 
                  apply; instead, the privacy policy of the company actually providing 
                  the goods or services will apply. We urge you to read and understand 
                  those policies before entering into agreements with such companies. 
                  We are committed to working with companies that share our privacy 
                  concerns. Got Vape?, however, can't control or take responsibility 
                  for the way these companies collect or use information. </p>
                <p>Also, when you access the Web site of another company, an advertiser, 
                  or Web site linked from the www.gotvape.com Web site, those 
                  companies or sites may use cookies or other means to collect 
                  information about you. Again, the www.gotvape.com privacy policy 
                  does not apply to these instances; instead, the privacy policy 
                  of the site you visit will apply.</p>
                <p>If you have questions about the privacy policies of strategic 
                  alliance companies or the privacy policies of other sites, we 
                  encourage you to contact them directly. </p>
                <p><b>How and with whom does Got Vape? share my information? </b></p>
                <p><b> Strategic Alliance Businesses/Advertisers<br>
                  </b>If you choose to receive information from companies with 
                  which we have a strategic alliance, Got Vape? (or agents working 
                  on behalf of Got Vape? and under confidentiality agreements) 
                  will send you these direct mailings. Got Vape? will not provide 
                  your information to strategic alliance companies unless it is 
                  necessary to complete a purchase from or transaction with such 
                  company or to provide a co-branded product/service on the www.gotvape.com 
                  Web site that you have ordered. This may be necessary so that 
                  the company may process your orders and ship, supply, maintain, 
                  or service the goods or services that you requested. If you 
                  register directly with another company reached through the www.gotvape.com 
                  site, that company will have control over the information you 
                  provide. </p>
                <p>From time to time, we share aggregated data regarding the Members 
                  and users of our services (for example, the percentage of our 
                  users that are architects, or that Members who choose one type 
                  of service request a related service a certain percentage of 
                  the time). Some of this information may include the data obtained 
                  as described in the "cookies" section below, but no 
                  personally identifiable information is included in these types 
                  of statistics. </p>
                <p><b>Sponsors/Contests/Surveys</b><br>
                  Information we obtain from voluntary programs such as surveys, 
                  promotions, and contests may be subject to additional or different 
                  terms or may be used in a slightly different way. If different 
                  terms do apply, details of the shared use of this information 
                  will be outlined in the specific terms and conditions or rules 
                  of these special surveys, promotions, or contests. Please be 
                  sure to read those specific terms and conditions, as they may 
                  deviate from what is set forth in this privacy policy on a case-by-case 
                  basis.</p>
                <p><b>Special Cases</b><br>
                  Got Vape? may also share information for the following purposes:

                <p><b>What are my choices regarding the use of my information?</b></p>

                  All areas on the GotVape.com Web site that prompt you to log
