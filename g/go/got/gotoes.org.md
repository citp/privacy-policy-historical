GOTOES respects your privacy. This Privacy Statement informs you of our privacy practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected online and how that information is used. This statement is readily available on our home page.  

GOTOES collects very limited information about you. For example, when you order products, you will be directed to PayPal to make a payment.  Paypal retains all of your personal information, but by necessity PayPal must send us your email address (so we can provide you with your purchase and receipt).  PayPal may or may not make your shipping information available to us, depending on the transaction.

The GOTOES website may provide links to third-party websites for your convenience and information. If you access those links, you will leave the GOTOES website. GOTOES  does not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from GOTOES' practices. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites. The personal data you choose to provide to or that is collected by these third parties is not covered by the GOTOES Privacy Statement. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information. 

GOTOES will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others.

GOTOES takes seriously the trust you place in us. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, GOTOES utilizes appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact us using the contact us link - available on most pages, and our home page.
