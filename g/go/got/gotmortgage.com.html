  <p class="sm" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Security 
  Statement</b><br>
  <br>
  Secure web pages. All of the pages on our website that ask for your personal 
  information are delivered to your browser through HTTPS, a secure server 
  communications layer. To verify the security of a page, look for the “lock” 
  (in Internet Explorer) or “key” icon (in Netscape) on your browser. <br>
  <br>
  Encryption technology. When you send your personal financial information to 
  Gotmortgage.com, it is protected by the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) system. 
  SSL prevents anyone from intercepting or reading your personal information by 
  encrypting, or translating, the data into a string of gibberish characters. 
  Only we can decode the encryption.<br>
  <br>
  Firewall protection. Your financial information is not kept on our web server, 
  but on a different computer that is separate from the Internet. Even in the 
  unlikely event that our website is “hacked,” your data will still remain 
  safely out of reach. <br>
  <br>
  Password protection. To obtain any information about your loan status, you are 
  required to enter a username and password. This procedure is in place to 
  prevent unauthorized users from accessing your account and personal 
  information.</font></p>
