<h2>Information Collection and Use by GotchaMovies.com</h2>

musical interests, gender, age, location and occupation.
</p>

<p>
GotchaMovies.com also logs non-personally-identifiable information, such as
IP address and browser type, from all users and visitors to the site. This
data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website
services.
</p>

<p>
User Profile information including members' pictures and first names are

also to send reminders of the invitations. GotchaMovies.com does not sell
these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides
invitations, invitation reminders, and notifications of member services
(such as messages from other members). Recipients of invitations from
GotchaMovies.com may contact GotchaMovies.com to request the removal of this
information from our database.
