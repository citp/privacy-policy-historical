"This is by far the most effective safelist around. I started out as a free member and immediately started to receive a few sales to the program I was promoting the same week I sent out my ads on GOT Safelist. I was so impressed with the response rate I decided to upgrade my membership and I have not looked back since. It's so hard to find a good safelist these days I am sticking with this one!"  
\- **Audrey Fogbrono - Texas**

"I joined Gotsafelist during prelaunch. I was looking for a way of advertising and making money doing it and their safelist seemed to fit the bill. Although the list is still very young, membership is growing rapidly and I have already had a large increase in requests for further information regarding my internet marketing exercise with nonileads while, simultaneously, new members have been joining my safelist downline due to promotions I am running on other sites. Fantastic!"  
\- **Mick Popp - Japan**

"I just signed up and I started promoting the software I was selling a few hours later! The site is so easy to navigate and the instructions were very clear. I am no computer wiz so thank you GOT Safelist for making it so easy for me!"  
\- **Adrian Martinez - New York**

"I've been doing online marketing for over 6 months and needless to say that I've spent a lot of money and very little success. When I heard about GOTSafelist from a colleague I signed up for an account. I mean it was free so I had nothing to loose. Out of the dozen of safelists I had already joined I have to admit this one by far had the most professional support staff I have ever ran into. They helped me with all my questions and even helped me with my HTML ad. This one is a keeper for me! Where else can you find a more reliable safelist ... "

"I belong to a lot of safelists because it’s essential for marketing my business. But this is the only safelist that I have seen that will actually give you credits month after month and then give you the opportunity to turn them back into cash. All the other safelists I belong to just let me use them to send out ads and that’s it. Thanks for helping out the little guy GOTSafelist PLUS!" "
