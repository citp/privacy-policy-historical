To register, we will ask for contact information (job seekers and employers) and information on your company (employers). GotoGulf.com is the sole owner of information collected on the registration pages and we will not disclose this information to anyone outside of GotoGulf.com. Your contact information (such as name and email address) may however be used to contact you about any features/services on our site and partner sites which we believe may be of interest.
