**Information you choose to provide:**

In order to register, you will be asked to sign-in using your Facebook login.  If you do so, you authorize us to access certain Facebook account information, including information about your Facebook friends who might be common Facebook friends with other Tinder users. By allowing us to access your Facebook account, you understand that we will obtain and share your name and a profile picture, as well as the name and profile picture of your Facebook friends who are common Facebook friends with other Tinder users in your network or geolocation. 

Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable screens or pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.

You may also (but are not required to) provide information about yourself (such as your gender, location, URL, or a biography).  Any additional image or information you provide may be publicly displayed. If you wish, we will delete your account information; to do so, please close your account by sending an email to [help@gotinder.com](mailto:help@gotinder.com)

**Information about others:**

We may collect and store personal information about other people that is available to us through your Facebook login, namely the name and picture of certain of your Facebook friends as follows: we will only share this information with other Tinder users who are already friends with your Facebook friend and who already have access to such information.
