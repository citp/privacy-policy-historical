## About This Site

GoToBermuda.com is the Official site for Bermuda Tourism, established by the Government of Bermuda.

## Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy is important to Bermuda Tourism. We hope the following policy will help you understand how gotobermuda.com collects, uses, and safeguards the personal information you provide on our web site.

## Information Collection

If you browse the Bermuda Tourism website, you can do so anonymously. We do not automatically collect personal information -- including your e-mail address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which parts of our web site you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable. The only other information automatically provided to us is the type of computer and operating system you are using. Your browser supplies us with this information.

Like many other commercial web sites, the Bermuda Tourism website may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site.

At times we may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information, such as your e-mail address, phone number, and postal address, for purposes such as corresponding with us, making a purchase, entering a sweepstakes, or participating in an online survey.

Except as described in this policy, we do not share your profile with anyone else outside of Bermuda Tourism without your consent, and no one else can access your information.

## Information Use

If you provide us with your e-mail or postal address, or have done so in the past, we will ask you if we can use it to send you updates on the latest Bermuda events and promotions. If you do not want us to contact you, you can choose to "opt out," and Bermuda Tourism will respect your wishes.

When you supply Bermuda Tourism with your personal information, we may use it to confirm a purchase, or to learn more about our customers so that we can develop better products and services. We may also use the information to inform you about new products, services and offers that may be of interest to you. These offers may be based on information you provided in your initial transaction with us or in surveys. We may also share the information with authorities as required by law or an order of a court or regulatory agency.

## Declining Email Offers

Bermuda Tourism provides customers with an easy means to decline to receive e-mail offers. Although most customers tell us they appreciate receiving notice of these opportunities, we recognize the importance of providing you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these offers from us by simply replying to the e-mail and informing us of your preferences. All e-mail offers that you receive from gotobermuda.com will tell you how to decline further e-mail offers. It will take seven (7) days for Bermuda Tourism to process all unsubscribe requests.

## Information From Third Parties

We may receive personally identifiable information from third parties as follows:

  * Updated delivery and address information from our vendors and other third parties who furnish various fulfillment and consulting services
  * Information from our business partners who are third parties that offer products and services, including but not limited to, travel services. These specialty business partners have received your information in connection with transactions that you conduct with them or because you have provided it to them in connection with your purchase of their products or use of their services. These specialty business partners have established their own respective policies and practices on the collection and use of personal information gathered from you. Therefore you should refer to their privacy policies to understand how they handle your information and your options available to you.
  * Information from our service providers who perform functions on our behalf.
  * Information from our product suppliers with whom we participate in joint promotional activities.



Demographic information such as age and gender and number of household members, dates of travel, travel preference information and mailing lists from our partners and other third parties.

Bermuda Tourism encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites their children visit. No information should be submitted to, or posted at, Bermuda Tourism web site by visitors under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. In the event we become aware of the inadvertent collection of personal information from children under 13, we will delete such information.

We have put in place the appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to prevent unauthorized access and safeguard and secure the information we collect. Any information we collect our sites is stored on a secured server and is not directly connected to the Internet.

It should, however, be recognized that no company can perfectly protect personal information.
