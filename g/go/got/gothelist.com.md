how we collect, protect, use and share information gathered from/about you and all third parties on our

1.2     You should feel free to decline to provide any information that we request, however, please
        note that in doing so, it may make it difficult for The List to fulfill your request or advertise
        your product. We use the information that we collect to provide the products or services that
        you may search or request, to improve and customize our Service, and to contact you about
        special promotions and new products.
1.3     Information we collect from Third Parties. We may collect information about you from the
        parties and services that we engage to provide your requests. We may also collect information
        about you from third party services and from publicly available sources. For example, we may

2.1     We may automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our Website
        or use our Service. For instance, when you visit our Website, we may send one or more
        cookies—a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters—to your computer
        that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us enhance your navigation through the Website.
        A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use our Website (e.g., the
        products you view, the links you click, how frequently you access our Website, and other

      invisible to the human eye, which allow websites or other online services to track users. The
      List and our third-party advertising company use pixel tags in HTML-enabled email to track
      whether (and when) the recipient opened the message.

      pixel tags to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it the next time
      you use our Service; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including
      advertising; (c) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our website and our email
      communications; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage,
