Your privacy is very important to us. GotSoccer, LLC and our affiliates (collectively "GotSoccer", "we", "us", "our") value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using our websites, services, products, social media sites, support, tools and applications (collectively our "Services"), you signify your consent to our collection and use of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.   
In connection with using our Services, we may collect information from you which can be used to identify you, such as your name, address, email address, phone, date of birth, gender, username and password ("Personal Data"). This Privacy Policy explains what Personal Data about you we collect from you and others, and how we use it. As you use our Services, we want you to be clear how we are using your information and the ways in which you can protect your Personal Data.

If you opt-out of the use of your Personal Data, you will not be able to use our Services. 

#### WHY WE COLLECT AND USE PERSONAL DATA:

We use your Personal Data with your consent and in furtherance of our legitimate interests, including providing you with any Services you have requested or authorized. The Personal Data we collect from you and others allows you to use our Services, and for you to register for and log into your GotSoccer Account. We collect and use your Personal Data to provide you the best experience with our Services, and so that you or your child may participate on his or her team, club and association. 

#### WHAT PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT:

We may collect Personal Data in the following ways: 

  1. Information You Provide. Many of our Services require you provide your Personal Data, including to register for a GotSoccer Account. When you register, we may ask for personal information, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, gender, birth date and other personal information necessary for you to participate on your team, club, state association and national organization. You may also provide us Personal Data when you request our Services or report a problem with our Services.

GotSoccer may collect and process Personal Data provided by our clients, which may include your team, club, association, state association, national organization, and other similar organizations (collectively "GotSoccer Clients"). These GotSoccer Clients may provide us information about you, with your consent, so that you may use our Services and participate on your team or club. For example, your team's manager, coach or your club may provide us, with your consent, your player information and other Personal Data to register you for a tournament or a league. Your club may authorize your team manager, team coach or other representatives to access your Personal Data for the purposes of administering your team. If a GotSoccer Client provides any of your Personal Data to us, the GotSoccer Client is responsible for providing any notices and/or obtaining any consents necessary from you for us to access and use the Personal Data. We do not control information collection or use practices of GotSoccer Clients. Please contact your team, club, association, state association, national organization, or other organizations regarding their own privacy policies. Once your Personal Data is provided to us by a GotSoccer Client, you may access and control your Personal Data pursuant to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
