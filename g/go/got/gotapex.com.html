              <b>RealGN's Privacy Policy: </b><br><br>
In an attempt to streamline and enhance your experience at RealGN, we as a network do not collect any information about you or
your computer without your prior consent. During your stay at RealGN or any of its affiliate sites, we do provide you with ads
to view and outside links to follow. We here at RealGN feel that your privacy is of utmost importance and that you should only
have to give up personal information that you want to. There are 2 points at which we will collect information about you, and
these 2 places are completely voluntary. 
The first place is our forums and web email sections. Information is only collected when a user registers in the forum or for
a web mail address. Of course we do not want to force anything upon you, so the forum is completely usable by non-registered
users. They do not have some of the added features that registered users get, but as of yet it is not necessary to register.
The other place at which we collect information from you, is when you enter into a contest at the site. The information we
collect is purely for the reason that if you win one of the contests, then we will use that information to send you the
prize. Once again, the contest is optional, and we do have an option to opt out of sending information about yourself when you
enter into the contest.<br><br><b>Ad Policy: </b><br><br>
With the ads that RealGN serves, we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address,
phone number, or e-mail address. However, our ad provider does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information
such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating
system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). The information collected by our ad provider is used for the purpose of
targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers. <br><br><b>Third Party Advertising:</b><br><br>
We use DoubleClick and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may
use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web
sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to
you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by
these companies, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">here</a><br><br><b>Third Party Cookies</b><br><br>
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on
your browser.<br><br>
