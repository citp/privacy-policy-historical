# Privacy - Sphero About

## …AKA: Lots of Legal Stuff

## Overview

As the industry leaders in connected play, we are passionate about protecting your privacy. This is just a brief summary for you to get the gist of the information we collect and why. Some of our toys collect different types of information, so make sure to check our toy-specific privacy policies as well. See below for our full privacy policy and fine print, written in legalese.

## Trust is our priority

We limit the information we collect from children using our toys, and give parents control over their children’s information.

## Collection & Use of Data

**Information about you:  **We may collect information about you, such as your name, age, gender, and username. We use this to provide our service and personalize it for you. For example, we use this information:

  * to set up and maintain your account;
  * so our creations can greet you by name and preferred pronoun;
  * to localize our services;
  * to age-tag our subject matter;
  * to deliver age-appropriate content; and
  * to manage your warranty.



**Contacting You:  **We may collect information about you, such as your name, age, gender, and username. We use this to provide our service and personalize it for you. For example, we use this information:

  * deliver toys;
  * send support or administrative emails regarding the service;
  * send emails about new toys, deals, awesome content and more; and
  * help us provide support.



**Tip:  **If you want to unsubscribe from our marketing emails (although we’re not sure why you would), simply click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any Sphero email and tell us “it’s not you, it’s me” to soften the blow.

**Data from our toys:  **We collect data from our toys, like when it crashes or how the toy is working. We use this information to, for example:

  * provide the smoothest play experience we can; and
  * create analytics about how our toys work.



**User Controls:  **Several of our toys process data about the commands you give when you use audio or visual controls. The data is only processed on your toy or device in real-time. We don’t store these inputs on our servers.

**User Content:  **Our toys or applications may allow you to record video or audio content, or provide text content. Unless we tell you otherwise, like in Sphero Edu, these are processed and stored only on the device and shown when you want to play them.

**Activity History:  **This is a record of your progress, like a ‘saved game’ in video game terms. We use this so you can keep up with what you’ve done with our toys and on your account.

**Analytics:  **We collect some data if you visit our Site, such as data about the pages you visit, how you use the site, etc. We use this data to:

  * help improve our site, and
  * in some cases, as part of advertising.

## How we share your data

We don’t share your data often, but we do share it in a few ways:

Parents/Teachers
    If you use Sphero Edu in school, we share data with teachers and with parents to make sure they can keep track of their children’s information.
Service providers
    Sometimes we ask smart people to do neat things for us, like analyzing how our toys and websites are used, hosting in the cloud, and managing our mailing list.
Other parties
    We share data in a few other ways, like when we need to because the law (or our lawyers) tells us we have to.

Learn more about data sharing >

## You’re in Control!

We make sure you have control over your data and how we use it. If you don’t want to get messages from us or want to close an account, you can do so at any time. Plus, if you want to delete your in-app data from our live systems, just email our team at [support@sphero.com ](mailto:support@sphero.com)and we’ll take care of it (though we may still retain copies of your records in our routine backups). See below for more information about your data rights.

## Security

Important information sent to our servers is encrypted in transmission. This is a fancy way of saying we use a code to make sure only the right people can read it. We regularly update our apps and servers to incorporate new and improved security practices and we regularly engage third-party security experts to audit our infrastructure. While many of our toys are hackable and we encourage people to learn, experiment, and build on our platforms, we do put security measures in place to prevent our robots from being used in nefarious ways. Find or suspect a vulnerability in our system? Let us know at [security@sphero.com.](mailto:security@sphero.com)

Learn more about our security >

## International Users

Sphero’s HQ is in the (really awesome!) city of Boulder, CO. That means we have to transfer international data to the U.S. If you’re in the EU, we do this as part of a program called “Privacy Shield” that helps protect your data.

Subject to your Rights and Choices below, we generally process your data in the following ways:

A. To Provide our Services

We generally use the Personal Data as necessary to provide our Services, or complete transactions you request. For example:

  * We use identity and contact data to create your account, where applicable.
  * When you reserve or buy a toy, we will process the identity data, payment data, and contact data you give us that is necessary to complete the transaction.

  * If you apply to work at Sphero, we use the Job Data to evaluate your application and contact you about it.



B. Toy Operation

Our toys are interactive, and we are always working to improve our toys and make sure everything works. For example:

  * We process user controls and user content on the toy or device to help you interact with or control the toys, or store your content for use by the toy.
  * We use device data and toy data to understand a user’s engagement in an activity or feature, for example which activities you played on the toy and data about any crashes during use.
  * We use contact and identity data to help personalize the content, e.g. greeting you by username, tracking in-game progress, using the right language, or showing you age-appropriate activities.



C. Analytics

We are always working to improve our Site and want to keep visitors informed about our toys and Services. For example:

  * We use usage data when you visit our Site to manage traffic and help us understand and improve the design, usability, and other aspects of our Site.

These services may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you complete a purchase for a good or service you were shown in an advertisement. See your Rights and Choices below, or Facebook or Twitter’s privacy policies, for information about how you can limit or opt out of this processing.

F. Support

If you are a child under applicable law, we will only contact you regarding support in compliance with applicable law.
