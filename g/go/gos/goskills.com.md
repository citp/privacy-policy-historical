# Privacy | GoSkills.com

Please read our privacy policy, part of our [terms of use](https://web.archive.org/terms).

We collect personal information about users in order to provide GoSkills software services and to interact with and respond to users and also to organizations that GoSkills is provided to on an organizational basis.

Examples of such personal information include information provided when you fill in forms on our website to register to use it, subscribe to our courses, answer tests and quizzes, post material, enter promotions, report problems with the site, request further services, etc. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.

You are encouraged to review and update your personal information, as appropriate, at any time.

In addition, for the purpose of analyzing user trends and internet traffic (see the section about cookies and measuring website traffic below), we may collect details of your visit to our website, information about your computer, Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser, etc.

In the case of services provided on an organizational basis, for example where users redeem a coupon issued for their organization’s staff to use, we may report personal information about users to the organization’s administrators – for their own legitimate purposes and also for our own, including redeeming access coupon codes.

We reserve the right to collect any other information at our discretion, and to notify users of news and other important information via email.

### Data storage

We will store your personal information on servers located at approved locations under contract to GoSkills Ltd. Data will be stored indefinitely and used for the purposes described in this policy.

### Confidentiality and security

We will not disclose your personal information to third parties unless: you authorize us, or we are required to do so to enforce our terms of use or fulfil agreements with organizations that GoSkills is provided to on an organizational basis, or when the GoSkills certificate authenticity verification process necessarily reveals your certificate details to someone who knows your name and certificate verification number.

We strive to keep users’ personal information as secure as possible. However, as it’s impossible for any exchange of data to be completely secure, all transmissions of data are at users’ own risk.

### Cookies and measuring website traffic

We use Google Analytics and related tools to analyze how the GoSkills website is used. Google Analytics uses what are known as ‘cookies’: text files placed on users’ computers to collect standard internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. Cookie information is transmitted to Google and used to evaluate and to produce statistics about website activity.

We will not use (nor allow third parties to use) such tools to track or collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of visitors to our website. We will not associate any data gathered from our site with any PII from other sources, unless you explicitly submit that information via a fill-in form on our website.

### Advertising

We use the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the website. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy. You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by using cookie settings or permanently by using a browser plugin.
