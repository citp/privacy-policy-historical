                This policy has been developed because we want you to feel confident about the privacy and security of your

                of your information as required by law. Our security procedures mean that we may ask for proof of your identity 
                before we will disclose information about you, or to you, be this on our website or over the telephone. 
                <br><br>
                In order to provide our service to you we need to collect and process personal information about you and 
                disclose that information to a number of third party service providers. This information is necessary to 
                provide you with the quotations you have requested. All personal information will be held in strictest confidence

                Our comparison technology will disclose the information you have entered into the Gocompare.com website to 
                our partner websites for the purpose of providing us with quotations on the requested product. We will 
                also be using your data for our own research and for tracking any purchased policies. By using our

                purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime. By submitting information into our website, you consent to 
                the processing of this data about you by us and the product providers. We may also use the information you

            <p class="para-start">
                Most websites will send a confirmation email once a quote has been completed on their website, but as we go to a large 
                number of websites with our technology, you could receive further emails or phone calls from our partners. To prevent this from 
                happening we will not opt-in to marketing communications on any of the underlying websites. By taking this route 
                for you, you should not receive any communication from any of the providers other than those outlined in this 
                Privacy Statement. Although we cannot guarantee this we do have contractual arrangements in place to prevent our 
                partners doing this, so please let us know if you do experience any problems.

                If you click through to a third party website from our website, we cannot guarantee

                If you have not ticked the box in the section entitled "Helping you complete your purchase", you agree that 
                your details may be used by the top two competing individual service providers who provided you with the 
                cheapest quotes to contact you with a view to seeing if you are interested in purchasing the quote. 
                They may also highlight any special offers or ways they might be able to help you get an even cheaper 
                price with them. Please note that the companies contacting you are solely based on the cheapest price 
                retrieved not exclusively based on the cover you selected. They are only entitled to contact you on 
                this particular quotation and only for a limited period of time, after which they are obliged to 
                consider your details as 'off limits' i.e. opted-out under the terminology of the Data Protection 
                Act 1998. Some partners may also contact you by telephone if you click through to their website to 
                help you with any queries you may have, regardless of their position in the results. 
            </p>


           <h2 class="green" style="padding-top:10px;">Monitoring</h2>
           <p class="para-start">
                Monitoring or recording of your calls, emails, text messages and other communications may take place 
                in accordance with UK law, and in particular for business purposes, such as for quality control and 
                training; processing necessary for the entering into or the performance of a contract; to prevent 
                unauthorised use of our telecommunication systems and websites; to ensure effective systems operation; 
                to meet any legal obligation; in order to prevent or detect crime; and for the purposes of the 
                legitimate interests of the data controller. Please visit the following websites for further 
                information

           </p>


           <h2 class="green" style="padding-top:10px;">Confidentiality</h2>
           <p class="para-start">
                We will endeavour to treat all your personal information as private and confidential. Other than under the 
                terms of this Privacy Statement we will not disclose any of your information to anyone. We would like to bring 
                your attention though to our obligations to disclose information in the following four exceptional cases 
                permitted by law. These are where we are legally compelled to do so; where there is a duty to the public 
                to disclose; where disclosure is required to protect our interest; and where disclosure is made at your 
                request or with your consent. 
                <br><br>
                If relevant, your policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID), run by the Motor 
                Insurers Information Centre (MIIC). 
                <br><br>
                This may be consulted by the Police in order to establish who is insured to drive the vehicle. 
                <br><br>
                If you are involved in an accident, (in the UK or abroad), other UK Insurance companies, the Motor Insurers 
                Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to ascertain relevant policy information. Persons with a valid claim in 
                respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain certain information 
                which is held on the MID. You can find out more about this at <a href="http://www.miic.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.miic.org.uk</a><sup>†</sup> 
                <br><br>
                Should you take the decision to make a complaint about the service we have provided, we may be obliged to 
                forward details about your complaint, including your personal information, to the relevant ombudsman in 
                existence at the time. You can be assured that they are similarly obliged to adhere to the Data 
                Protection Act 1998 and keep your information strictly confidential. 
           </p>

            
           <h2 class="green" style="padding-top:10px;">Credit searches</h2>
           <p class="para-start">
                Many insurance and financial services providers operate a credit scoring system and will carry out checks with 
                credit reference and fraud prevention agencies. These checks will include electoral roll and credit information. 
                The insurance checks are registered as general insurance searches and may be viewed by other companies when you 
                apply for credit or insurance. Often the financial services quotes you request will only do a credit check once 
                you have decided on a particular supplier. Every application you submit for a loan or credit card may affect your 
                credit scoring so you may wish to keep applications to a minimum for your credit rating. Again, this is not 
                happening specifically because you are using our service. This may happen regardless of whether you get a 
                quote via the internet or phone for any of these services. PLEASE REMEMBER while we do not carry out credit searches 
                on our website, our partners may do so at any stage of the quote process.
           </p>
