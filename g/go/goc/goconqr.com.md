##  INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOUR COMPUTER 

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system of your computer and browser type of your computer, for our system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions (i.e. use of our Service) and patterns, and does not identify you or any individual. 

##  COOKIES 

Our Service uses "Cookies" to distinguish you from other users of our Service and to anonymously track visiting and browsing patterns. A Cookie is a small text file implanted by us and most other website operators (or an advertiser on this site) on the hard disk of your computer when you visit the site. Cookies can collect information about users of our Service like you, such as your names, address, e-mail details, passwords and your user preferences. While cookies and the information they obtain may not identify a living individual on their own, they may be able to do so in combination with other information held by us or a third party. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our Service and also allows us to improve our site. The website uses session cookies for site navigation purposes. These cookies expire and are deleted at the end of a browsing session. We also use Google Analytics for tracking and data capture purposes. Data collected through cookies is always anonymous and aggregated. 

##  WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA 

The data that we collect from you will not be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area which consists of the European Union, Norway and Iceland ("EEA"). It will only be processed by staff operating in the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, processing your subscription, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. 

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. A server is a machine that amongst others stores and processes data or information. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Service or your account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of or sending by you of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted or sent by you to our Service; any transmission or sending by you is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access _i.e._ access to your data by a person who should not have such access. 

##  ACCESSING THE SERVICE THROUGH OUR APPS 

The service is available to access through mobile applications. Our Apps use third party service providers to provide functionality to our users. 

The data gathered by the third party providers relates to the aggregate usage of our service and does not contain personal identifiable data. 

These third party service providers may transfer, store and use the data in the United States and any other country in which they operate. 

Privacy and Data protection laws in some of these countries may vary from the laws of the Country in which you live. 

##  USES MADE OF THE INFORMATION 

We use information held about you in the following ways: 

  * To ensure that content from our Service is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.

We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 users in the United Kingdom have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, users in London). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience. 

##  DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

##  GOCONQR CAMPUS 

GoConqr Campus provides businesses and educational institutions with a branded portal and Campus groups to facilitate education and knowledge sharing on the GoConqr platform.

You may leave a Campus at any time, while maintaining your membership of GoConqr and access to resources that you have created.

##  PRIVACY OF CHILDREN 

Our services and products are not targeted at children under thirteen (13) years of age.

##  SAFEGUARDING CHILDREN’S PERSONAL DATA 

We also have a number of protections dealing with the personal data of persons under 18 years of age. These are that a guardian or parent has the right to review the personal data the Service has collected from their child, have their child’s personal data deleted from the site and also request us to cease obtaining further personal data from the child going forward.

  * You are the parent or guardian; 
  * Your child is under the age of eighteen years; 
  * Whether you would like to have the right to review the information the site has collected from your child, have your child’s personal data deleted from the site and/or request us to stop collecting further personal data from your child in the future. 
  * Your child’s username or account name; 
  * Your e-mail address. 



When we receive the affidavit we will be able to carry out your instructions. If you are submitting an affidavit in relation to a child under 13 years of age, then please do not include any of their personal data.
