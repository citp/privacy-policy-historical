##  IMPORTANT PRIVACY INFO 

###  Your rights as the data subject 

GoConqr adheres to applicable data protection laws in the European Economic Area which, if applicable, affords you, the data subject, the following rights: 

  * If the processing of personal data is based on your consent, you have a right to withdraw consent at any time for future processing; 
  * You have a right to request from us, a “data controller” as defined in the law, access to and rectification of your personal data; 
  * You have a right to object to the processing of your personal data; and 



When we process personal data about you, we do so with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of GoConqr as described in the  How we use the data collected section above. 

When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in “Where we store data” below. 

###  Where we store data 

The data that we collect from you will not be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area which consists of the European Union, Norway and Iceland ("EEA"), unless it is required to be processed by a third party partner. In the instance that information is transferred outside of the EEA, it will only be done so with partners that are fully compliant with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. Thus ensuring that your data is kept safe. 

Staff maybe engaged in, among other things, processing your subscription, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. 

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. A server is a machine that stores and processes data or information. Any communication with our servers will be encrypted using SSL technology. 

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Service or your account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. 

Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access i.e. access to your data by a person who should not have such access. 

###  Security of data 

At GoConqr we are committed to protecting the security of your personal data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.

There may be legal or reporting circumstances that require us to keep some high level data regarding a user for an extended time period – e.g payment transaction records for tax purposes. If this is the case, the information will be deleted once the requested time period has passed. 

Upon successful confirmation of your account cancellation request your qualifying data will be deleted from our live database within a matter of minutes. However, a global service such as GoConqr will rely on multiple layers of caches, backups and logs, so fragments of your personal data will remain after your data has been removed from the live database. A summary of the other stores are listed below along with the type of data held and the maximum retention period before this data will be purged. 

**Data store** |  **Typical data held** |  **Retention period***

##  SPECIFIC SERVICES 

###  Mobile Apps 

GoConqr has a range of Mobile Applications (“Apps”) on the iOS and Android platforms (available until July 1st 2019) that allow you to access the platform in a manner optimised for mobile. Our Apps use third party service providers to provide functionality to our users. 

The data gathered by the third party providers relates to the aggregate usage of our service. Our partners include Fabric, Crashlytics, Firebase, Apple and Google Playstore. You may have separate data policies with Apple and Google relating to the download and purchase of mobile apps through their app stores. Compliance with app store policies is assumed when accessing the GoConqr mobile apps. 

These third party service providers are all signed up the EU-US Shield Privacy Frameworks - a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States in support of transatlantic commerce – ensuring the same level of care with personal data that we extend to you. 

###  GoConqr Campus 

GoConqr Campus provides businesses and educational institutions with a branded portal and Campus groups to facilitate education and knowledge sharing on the GoConqr platform. 

An institution may invite a user to a GoConqr Campus by providing that individual’s email contact details, and institutions that set up a GoConqr Campus undertake that they have permission to share that email for the purpose of setting up a GoConqr Campus. 

You may be invited to join a Campus on GoConqr. As a Campus member, you will receive benefits which include access to Campus groups and announcements. Users that join the GoConqr platform on the basis of a Campus invite are viewed as all other users from a data protection point of view and enjoy the same rights and privileges as all users. 

Your Campus plan may include the ability to access resources without logging in, the ability to create private resources, an ad free GoConqr experience, and the ability to have your performance tracked and certified. Performance can only be tracked by Campus administrators and users with appropriate permissions. Your Campus License Administrator is the data controller for Campus management and reporting. 

If an individual or institution on a SmartShares plan uses a capture form to capture user information on an embedded resource on their own external site, they are the data controller of that information. GoConqr will not access or process any data captured in data capture forms, save for reporting purposes for the SmartShares customer. 

You may leave a Campus at any time while maintaining your membership of GoConqr and access to resources that you have created.
