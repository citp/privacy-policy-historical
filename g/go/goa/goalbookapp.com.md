# Goalbook | Privacy

PRIVACY POLICY

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Enome, Inc. (“Enome” “us” or “we”) and Goalbook, our web-based network that provides functionality for teams of educators, parents, and students to collaborate around student personal learning plans, and provides a toolkit for organizations such as schools to personalize learning plans and resources to their individual students’ needs (collectively, the “Services”), as further described in the Goalbook Terms of Use. 

This Privacy Policy describes the information that we gather from you, how we use and disclose your information, and the steps we take to protect your information. By using the Services, you consent to the privacy practices described in this policy. 

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Goalbook [Terms of Use](https://goalbookapp.com/terms). Capitalized terms that are not defined in the Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in the Terms of Use. 

## Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy:

Protecting the privacy of children is important to us and we are committed to compliance with the Federal Trade Commission’s rules implementing the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Persons under the age of 13 (herein referred to as “Minors”), may only use the Services and disclose personally identifiable information to us when: (i) Enome has contracted with the organization  through which the Minor gains access to the Services (the “Contracting Organization”) to provide the Services for the use and benefit of the Contracting Organization, and for no other purpose, and (ii) the Contracting Organization, with full notice of our collection, use and disclosure practices as described in this Privacy Policy, has authorized us to collect a Minor’s personally identifiable information through the Services. The Contracting Organization’s authorization to us is based upon the Contracting Organization having obtained consent from the Minor’s parent or guardian. 

If we gain knowledge that we have collected personally identifiable information from a Minor without parental consent we will remove that information from the Services as quickly as possible. If you are under the age of 13 and do not have a valid Goalbook account, do not send us any personal information, such as through e-mail or otherwise. If you believe that a child under the age of 13 has sent us personal information without parental consent, please contact us at privacy@goalbookapp.com. 

## The information that we collect:

  * User-provided Information. When you use the Services you may provide and we may collect what is generally called “personally identifiable” information, such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, and demographic information. For example, you may provide us with personally identifiable information when you register for an account, post User Content, interact with other users of the Services through communication or messaging features, or send us customer service related requests. When you buy products or services from us, we may ask you for your credit or debit card number, type, expiration date, and similar information. Such information is collected and stored by our third-party payment processing company, and use of such information is governed by such company’s applicable terms of service and privacy policy.
  * Information from other Users. We may receive information, including personally identifiable information, from other users of the Services. For example, we may receive personally identifiable information about a student when a  Contracting Organization uploads that student’s “Personal Education Plan.” We protect this personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  * "Cookies" Information. When you use the Services, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to our website. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser “Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Services to their fullest potential.
  * "Automatically Collected" Information. When you use the Services or open one of our HTML e-mails, we may automatically record certain information from your web browser by using different types of technology, including “clear gifs" or “web beacons." This “automatically collected" information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after our website, the pages you view on the Services, and the dates and times that you access the Services. This information is gathered for all users.
  * Information Provided By Contracting Organizations. We may also receive information, including personally identifiable information, under our agreements with Contracting Organizations. It is the responsibility of the Contracting Organization to comply with all laws related to the disclosure of such information. For example, this personally identifiable information may include the educational records of students. It is the responsibility of the Contracting Organization to comply with the Federal Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA) and all state privacy laws and other laws. Once this information is in our possession, we will protect it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
