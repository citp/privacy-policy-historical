# Privacy Policy | Goalcast

**Privacy Policy – GOALCAST**

Goalcast Inc. (“ **Goalcast** ” or “ **we** ”) places particular importance on the protection of your Personal Information. That is why we are committed to ensure the accuracy, security and confidentiality of the Personal Information collected about you, in accordance with applicable laws. 

This Privacy Policy (the “ **Policy** ”) defines how Goalcast collects, uses, discloses and retains your Personal Information and is intended to help you understand our practices. By providing us with Personal Information, you consent to its processing in accordance with this Policy. 

This Policy does not apply to third-party websites and software (ex. Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, etc.) that may be accessed through our inspirational content website, transactional platform or application, as the case may be (collectively, our “ **Sites** ”). 

For the purposes of this Policy, “ **Personal Information** ” means any information about an identifiable individual, as defined in Canadian law.

Because Goalcast is all about trust, and to build that trust with its community, Goalcast has appointed a Chief Privacy Officer, which will answer any questions you have and address any comments or complaints about this Policy. Therefore, you may contact Anouare Abdou, Director of Operations at the following email address: Anouare (at) Goalcast (dot) com.

**4-YOUR CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION AND USE**

**Prior to use your Personal Information we will require your consent.** Your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information is required, except when inappropriate. (For example, for legal or security reasons, it may be impossible or impractical to obtain consent).

**6-OUR SECURITY MEASURES**

**We try our best to keep your Personal Information safe.** Goalcast implements industry-standard security measures to protect its customers from unauthorized access or use, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction or loss of their Personal Information.

**Sadly, not everybody is well-intentioned, and we cannot guaranty we will not get hacked.** Unfortunately, it is impossible for us to guarantee the absolute security of the Personal Information collected or transmitted through our Sites. You therefore understand and agree that (i) there are limits to the security and confidentiality of the Personal Information we collect that are beyond the control of Goalcast; (ii) the security, integrity and confidentiality of all Personal Information and data exchanged between you and Goalcast through our Sites cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) such Personal Information may be viewed or altered by a third party at the time of the transfer. For these reasons, Goalcast cannot be held responsible for any loss, capture or alteration of Personal Information. 

**7-ACCESS AND MODIFICATION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

**You can change your account information yourself.** You have access to your Personal Information through your user account on our Sites, if applicable. You can correct and update this Personal Information from this access.

**You may obtain copy of your Personal Information and have it corrected.** You may obtain a copy of your Personal Information or have it corrected, if it is incorrect, by sending us a written request by e-mail. 

**Before we consider any request, we must make sure that you are who you say you are.** No request for access, rectification or deletion may be considered unless it is made in writing by you when you prove that you are the individual concerned (or the representative, heir or successor of that individual, or the liquidator of the succession, a beneficiary of life insurance or of a death benefit). 

**We will address your request fast.** When we receive a request for access, rectification or removal, we will attempt to respond within a reasonable timeframe after receipt of the request.

**In some cases, we might not be able to provide you everything you ask for.** In certain situations, Goalcast may not be able to provide access to all the Personal Information it holds about you. Exceptions to the access requirement are meant to be limited and specific. The reasons for denying access will be provided to you upon request. 

**Some examples why we could refuse your request.** Exceptions may include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or proprietary commercial reasons and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.

A reasonable fee may be charged for the transcription, reproduction or transmission of Personal Information.

**8-PERSONAL INFORMATION DISCLOSURE**

Goalcast will not disclose your Personal Information to a third party unless you consent, or unless such disclosure or use is required by law.

**We may share your Personal Information to third parties, so that you may get information about stuff that you care about.** We may share your Personal Information with advertising partners in order to provide you targeted advertisement, either on our Sites or on those third-parties websites. Those partners may also use cookies, notably to track the effectiveness of those ads. 

**We may share aggregated data for research purposes.** Personal Information may also be disclosed without your consent for research purposes if the documents containing the Personal Information are not structured so as to allow retrieval by reference to your name or identifying code or symbol and the Personal Information cannot be retrieved by means of such a reference.

**9-POLICY CHANGE AND UPDATE**

**We may modify our Policy from time to time.** Goalcast may, at its discretion, update, revise, modify or supplement this Policy from time to time. If a change is made to the Policy, you will be notified when you log in and/or we will send you a link to the new version of the Policy. The Policy and any related agreements, if any, will be posted on our Sites. Goalcast asks its users to consult the amended Policy before continuing to use its services.

The complaints procedure is easily accessible and simple to use.

**We will accompany you in the process of a complaint and we promise to address it with care.** Goalcast will inform persons making an inquiry or complaint of the existence of the relevant procedures.
