# Privacy Policy - Goats On The Road

**GOATS ON THE ROAD PRIVACY POLICY:**

This privacy policy sets out how Goats On The Road uses and protects any information that you give Goats On The Road when you use this website.

Goats On The Road is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this website, then you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.

Please note that **Goats On The Road is a travel blog, not a multi-national corporation.** Most of the data that is collected on this website is automatic or done in the background. The only time we’d have your personal data (Like name and email address) is if you manually entered it into the site somewhere. We are not in the business of taking information or data from our users. The only reason our website takes any data at all is to help us better serve you.

If you’re worried about us using your data incorrectly, or selling it to a third-party like Facebook and other large companies have been accused of doing, that’s not the case.

These transactions will NEVER cost you an extra cent and in many cases, you actually receive a discount for using our links. Cookies are what make this possible, so by allowing our website to use cookies, you’re actually helping keep this site running. Without cookies, we wouldn’t make any commissions and therefore wouldn’t be able to offer so much amazing content for free.
