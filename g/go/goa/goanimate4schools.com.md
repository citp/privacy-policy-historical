# We treat your personal information very carefully

Thank you for visiting this GoAnimate, Inc. ("GoAnimate") Internet web site ("Site") located at the URL GoAnimate.com. This Privacy Policy details certain policies implemented throughout GoAnimate governing GoAnimate's use of personally identifiable information about users of our Site and users of our services (the "Services").   


Your privacy is important to us and, as described in this Privacy Policy, we try to protect information about you from unauthorized disclosure to others. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and, in certain circumstances, share your personally identifying information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us. 

##### Privacy Policy Updates

Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, GoAnimate may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, GoAnimate will post its updated Privacy Policy on our Site and we may send registered users an email, so you are always aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and how we may use this information. If any modification is unacceptable to you, you shall cease using this Site and the Services. If you do not cease using this Site and the Services, you will be deemed to have accepted the change.

##### Information Collection and Use

You can generally visit our Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. However, in certain sections of this Site and when you use our Services, we may invite you to register and become a member of GoAnimate. When you register, provide us with feedback or contact us, we may collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, contact data such as your email address, gender and username and password and any other personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to us in your communications that you transmit to us. We may offer you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such as occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.), or we may be able to collect that information from third party sites on which you have installed our Services (in accordance with the terms of use of those sites). 

We also may collect clear gifs and web bugs through your use of the Site. We also may collect all of the foregoing personally identifiable information about you from third party websites on which you post your animations through application programming interfaces and when you request an animation posted or created on our Site on a third party site as the animations are hosted on our Site.

In order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain internal reports, we collect aggregate information about the use of the Services, including information about users accessing the site or viewing animations or using our Services on other sites, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time. We may also use purpose-built tools provided by third parties to access, monitor, analyze, use and disclose this data.

We may use your personal information to register to use our Site and Services, deliver you certain Services, provide you with notices regarding services you have purchased or might want to purchase, improve the content and general administration of our Site and send you targeted advertising.

We make your profile and animations available to other users according to the control settings you set for yourself. If you have elected to make your animations public, then other users will be able to see that you posted animations and view your animations. We also use your name, email address and other information on our system to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, to solicit your feedback and input and to determine the type of content that you might like to view. In the event that we decide to allow you to submit other information about yourself, the availability of that information to other users will also be controlled by privacy settings you will set for yourself. In the event that you make your animations publicly available, or "embed" them on another publicly available web site (such as a social networking site), we may include links to those shows or web sites or otherwise identify them in our marketing materials as places where GoAnimate animations that may interest other users can be found.

##### Contests, Sweepstakes, and Promotions

From time to time you may be able to participate in contests, giveaways, sweepstakes or other similar promotions we sponsor on this Site. Participation such in contests, giveaways, sweepstakes or other similar promotions may require sharing your personal information with us or third parties sponsoring the contest, giveaway, or promotion, and we will use such personal information in accordance with the rules for such contest, giveaway, sweepstakes or other promotion. Therefore, you should check the rules to determine how your information will be used and shared with others. If a third party administers the contest, your participation may be subject to additional terms and conditions and that third party's privacy policy. We are not responsible for such third parties. You should carefully review these third parties' terms and conditions.

##### Children's Privacy

GoAnimate recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13. GoAnimate does not target its Services or this Site to children under 13. GoAnimate does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. 

##### Cookies

We may use small text files called cookies to improve overall Site experience. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you. 

##### Others' Information

You may decide to provide us with another person's email address so that person may be invited to join GoAnimate. We use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person that he or she has been invited to join GoAnimate. All invitees are provided with the option not to receive further invitations from GoAnimate. We may disclose such information if required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as described below.

##### Disclosure

We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to any third party. We may however provide your personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us. For example, we may provide your personally identifiable information to a marketing, research and/or advertising agency to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, and to solicit your feedback and input on our behalf. We will disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law or regulation or in cooperation with any governmental investigation. We may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which GoAnimate participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of GoAnimate's assets to which this Site relates. 

##### Links to Third Party Sites

The Site may provide links to other Web sites or resources over which GoAnimate does not have control ("External Web Sites"). Such links do not constitute an endorsement by GoAnimate of those External Web Sites. You acknowledge that GoAnimate is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that GoAnimate is not responsible for the content of such External Web Sites. Your use of External Web Sites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies located on the linked to External Web Sites.

##### Security

We may employ procedural and technological security measures that are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. GoAnimate may use secure socket layer, firewalls, password protection, and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information. 

##### Users Outside of the United States

Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal data will be processed by us in the United States where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a user account with the Site as a visitor from outside the United States, by using the Site you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

##### Correction/Updating Personally Identifiable Information 

GoAnimate provides you with the ability to review, correct and delete your contact information. If you wish to review or correct any information you have provided to us, you may access your account online.
