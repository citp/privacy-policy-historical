# We treat your personal information very carefully - GoAnimate for Schools

**Effective Date** : 7/20/2015 

GoAnimate for Schools, provided by GoAnimate, Inc. (“GoAnimate for Schools”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) recognizes the importance of the privacy of children and of all of its users. This COPPA Privacy Policy (“COPPA Policy”) is designed to comply with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and contains important information for teachers, parents, and children about how we collect, use, and disclose the personal information of users of our website [goanimate4schools.com](https://goanimate4schools.com/) (the “Site”) and the services available through our Site (collectively, the “Services”), including information from children under thirteen (13) years of age and teachers. 

While COPPA only applies to personal information collected from children under thirteen (13), GoAnimate for Schools is designed for use by persons under eighteen (18) years of age. Therefore, for purposes of this COPPA Policy, “student” or “students” means a “child” or “children” under eighteen (18). 

At GoAnimate, we provide tools for teachers and students to create animated videos. When a teacher uses our Services in the classroom or an educational setting to sign students up to GoAnimate, the teacher is required to provide consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from students and is required to affirm to us that they have the authority to do so. 

Students’ personal information will be handled as described in this COPPA Policy. Use of our Site or Services, and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this COPPA Policy and our [Terms of Service](https://goanimate4schools.com/termsofuse), including its applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes. Our [Terms of Service](https://goanimate4schools.com/termsofuse) are incorporated by reference into this COPPA Policy.

## Information We Collect

  * **Information We Collect Directly from Students.** We collect the login credentials for students provided to us by teachers, which may include a student’s name or email address. If a student chooses to record his/her own voice in an animation or otherwise input information into our Site or Services (e.g., text-to-speech language to help narrate a video), we also collect that student’s voice recording or other information. 
  * **Information We Collect Directly from Teachers.** We collect the login credentials for teachers, which may include the teacher’s name or email address. We will also collect any information that a teacher chooses to provide to us, such as a phone number, school, or title.

  * **Complying with the Law.** To comply with applicable legal obligations. 



## How We Disclose Information

We may disclose the information that we collect about our users with the following entities: 

  * **GoAnimate for Schools Users.** Teachers already know the login credentials of their students. Teachers will also have access to student videos and may be able to moderate their creation, editing, or deletion. Students and teachers may also message other students and/or teachers within our Services. 
  * **Service Providers.** We may disclose a teacher’s or student’s information to our vendors, service providers, agents, or others who perform functions on our behalf. 



We may also disclose the information that we collect about students in the following ways: 

  * **Business Transfers.** We may disclose a teacher’s or student’s information to another entity if we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding. 
  * **In Response to Legal Process.** We may disclose a teacher’s or student’s information in order to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, subpoena, court order, or other legal process. 
  * **To Protect Us and Others.** We may disclose a teacher’s or student’s information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our [Terms of Service ](https://goanimate4schools.com/termsofuse) or this COPPA Policy, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved. 
  * **Aggregate and De-Identified Information.** We may disclose aggregate or de-identified information about users for marketing, advertising, research, or similar purposes. 



##  Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms 

We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about our users’ use of our Site or Services. We or our service providers may combine this information with other personal information we collect from our users. 

  * **Do Not Track.** Our Site does not respond to Do Not Track signals and we may track a user’s activities once s/he leaves our Site. Users may disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies). 
  * **Cookies.** We or our service providers may use cookies to track visitor activity on our Site. A cookie is a text file that a website transfers to a user’s computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We or our service providers may use cookies to track user activities on our Site, such as the pages visited and time spent on our Site. Most browsers allow users to refuse cookies. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers can inform users about how to prevent their computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify a user upon receipt a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Users of our Site and Services who disable cookies may not be able to browse certain areas of the Site. 
  * **Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.** Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are embedded invisibly on web pages. We or our service providers may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to track the activities of our users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Site. We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our users, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded. 
  * **Third-Party Analytics.** We use third-party service providers, such as Google Analytics and Hubspot, to evaluate the use of our Site and our Services. We or our service providers use automated devices and applications to evaluate use of our Site and Services. We or our service providers use these tools to help us improve our Site, Services, performance, and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or Flash LSO, to perform their services. 



## User-Generated Content

Users can create content on our Site or Services, such as by creating videos using the assets we provide and importing their own assets (such as image and audio files) for inclusion in these videos. Teachers control the sharing and distribution settings for the videos created by their students. If a user publishes his/her video on our Site or Services, the video and information contained within will be available to other users to the extent agreed upon between GoAnimate for Schools and the user’s teacher, classmates, school, district, or other similar person or entity. We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this COPPA Policy, the law, or our user’s personal privacy. If a teacher downloads or exports a video, the resulting video file does not reside on our Site or Services and is no longer governed by this Policy. 

## Third-Party Links

Our Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this COPPA Policy but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites. 

## Security

We have taken steps to help protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security. Users should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to their accounts by, among other things, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess and keeping their log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on an account via unauthorized password activity. 

##  Rights to Review, Delete, and Control Our Use of Students’ Personal Information 

Teachers have a right to review the personal information we have collected about their students, to delete it, and to tell us to no longer use or disclose it. Teachers can review most of the personal information we collect about their students by logging in to their accounts and reviewing their account information and updating the personal information we maintain about their students. If a teacher does not want us to collect and use his/her student’s personal information anymore, then the teacher may cancel the student’s account and the student’s use of the Services. 

Parents may also contact us at schools@goanimate4schools.com to request access to their child’s information or cancellation of their child’s account. After liaising with that child’s teacher, we will endeavor to honor a parent’s request. 

## Users Outside the United States

Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so if a user is outside the United States his/her information will be processed by us in the United States where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as the user’s jurisdiction. If a user creates a user account with the Site as a visitor from outside the United States, by using the Site s/he agrees to this COPPA Policy and consents to the transfer of all such information to the United States. 

If users have questions about the privacy aspects of our Site or Services, please contact us at:
