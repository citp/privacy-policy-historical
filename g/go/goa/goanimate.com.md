## Information We Collect

We collect information about you directly from you, as well as automatically through your use of our Site or Services. We will not require you to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to use our Site and our Services.

  * **Information We Collect Directly from Users.** We collect your login credentials, which may include your name or email address. We also collect any other information you choose to provide to us, such as an address, phone number or job title. If you choose to record your own voice in an animation or otherwise input information into our Site or Services in any form, such as voice or text, we also collect that your voice recording or other information.
  * **Information We Collect Automatically.** We may automatically collect the following information about your use of our Site through cookies and other technologies: domain name; browser type; browser language; device ID; operating system type; device name and model; pages or screens viewed; links clicked; IP address; when and the length of time you visit our Site or use our Services; and the referring URL, or the webpage that led you to our Site.



## How We Use Information

We use the information that we collect about you for the following purposes:

  * **Providing Our Services.** To provide our Site and our Services and for other customer service purposes.
  * **Communicating with You.** To communicate with you, including by email, about our Services and to respond to your questions, to offer you additional services, or to provide you with additional content or information that might be relevant or interesting to you.
  * **Analyzing the Use of Our Services.** To better understand our users' access to and use of our Site and our Services, both on an individual and aggregated basis, and to respond to user desires and preferences.
  * **Complying with the Law.** To comply with applicable legal obligations.



## How We Disclose Information

We may disclose the information that we collect about you with the following entities:

  * **Your Employer.** If you are using the Site or the Services through your employer's account with us, we may disclose your information to your employer.
  * **Service Providers.** We may disclose your information to our vendors or service providers or agents who perform functions on our behalf. For example, we use cloud-based hosting providers to host the Site and the Services, and use other third party platform providers, such as marketing automation, customer support and community platforms, to provide other services. Accordingly, these vendors, service providers or agents may process and store your personal information.



We may also disclose the information that we collect about you in the following ways:

  * **Business Transfers.** We may disclose your information to another entity if we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding.
  * **In Response to Legal Process.** We may disclose your information in order to comply with the law, or a judicial proceeding, subpoena, court order or other legal process.
  * **To Protect Us and Others.** We may disclose your information when we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our [Terms of Service](https://goanimate.com/termsofuse) or this Privacy Policy, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
  * **Aggregate and De-Identified information.** We may disclose aggregate or de-identified information about our users for marketing, advertising, research or similar purposes.



## How Long We Retain Your Information and When We Delete Your Information

We will retain your personal information for as long as reasonably required to allow you to access (and resume access, as the case may be) to our Site and our Services, which is usually eighteen (18) months following the date when your most recent subscription ends, unless you ask us to delete sooner as provided below.

## Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms

We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about our users' use of our Site or Services. We or our service providers may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you.

  * **Do Not Track.** Our Site does not respond to Do Not Track signals and we or our third party service providers may track your activities once you leave our Site. Users may disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).
  * **Cookies.** We or our service providers may use cookies to track your activity on our Site. A cookie is a text file that a website transfers to your computer or device for record-keeping purposes. We or our service providers may use cookies to track your activities on our Site, such as the pages visited and time spent on our Site. Most browsers allow users to refuse cookies. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers can inform you about how to prevent a computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify a user upon receipt of a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to browse certain areas of our Site or use certain parts of our Services.
  * **Clear GIFs, Pixel Tags and Other Technologies.** Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are embedded invisibly on web pages. We or our service providers may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to track your activities, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Site. We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our users, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
  * **Third-Party Analytics.** We use third-party service providers to evaluate the use of our Site and our Services. We or our service providers use automated devices and applications to evaluate use of our Site and Services. We or our service providers use these tools to help us improve our Site, Services, performance, and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or Flash cookies, to perform their services.



## User-Generated Content

Users can create content on our Site or Services, such as by creating videos using the assets we provide and importing their own assets (such as image and audio files) for inclusion in these videos. You control the sharing and distribution settings for the videos created by you according to the control settings you set for yourself. If you have elected to make your animations public, then other users will be able to see that you posted animations and view your animations. We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that might violate this Privacy Policy, the law or your personal privacy. If you or other users authorized on your account download or export a video, the resulting video file does not reside on our Site or Services and is no longer governed by this Privacy Policy.

Users can also post materials and other information through their use of the GoAnimate Community site. You will determine what materials and information you post, and because those postings will be viewable by other users of the GoAnimate Community site, you should have no expectation of privacy with respect to such postings.

## Third-Party Links

Our Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Privacy Policy but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.

## Security

We have taken steps to help protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security. Users should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to their accounts by, among other things, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess and keeping their log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on an account as a result of unauthorized password activity.

In compliance with applicable law, we will notify governmental authorities of any data security breach within 72 hours of our becoming aware of the breach and, if it involves a high risk to your personal information, we will notify you as well.

## Right to Review, Delete and Control our Use of Your Information

You have the right to review the personal information we have collected about you, to erase or delete it, and to tell us to no longer use or disclose it. You can review most of the personal information we collect about you by logging into your account and reviewing your account information and updating the personal information we maintain about you. You may also contact us at [support@goanimate.com](mailto:support@GoAnimate.com) to request access to your personal information, erasure or deletion of your personal information and/or cancellation of your account. If you ask us to erase or delete your personal information, we will erase or delete your personal information within one month or less.

## Right to Remove Your Information

You have the right to obtain a copy of your personal information and take it with you. The copy will be in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format. If requested by you and when technically feasible, we will send that information via electronic means to a third party designated by you.

## Users Outside of the United States

Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal data will be processed by our service providers or us in the United States where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a user account with the Site as a visitor from outside the United States, by using the Site you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Children Under 13

Our Site and our Service are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records.  
We do, however, offer a service called GoAnimate4Schools, which is marketed to schools, teachers and sometimes parents. A separate privacy policy governs that service, which can be found at <https://goanimate4schools.com/privacy>.  
If you are under 18, you are not authorized to use our Site or Service. 

## Compliance

In compliance with the GDPR and applicable federal and state laws, we have conducted a privacy impact assessment, and have instituted steps to protect your personal information including training and awareness, monitoring and verification, and response and enforcement. We also keep records of how we process your personal information, and will conduct annual internal audits of our privacy and security practices.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is current as of the Effective Date set forth above. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically. We will post any changes to this Privacy Policy on our Site. If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy that materially affect our practices with regard to your personal information, we will provide you with email or written notice in advance of such change by highlighting the change on our Site or on our Service and obtain your consent to such change. If you do not consent to such change, we may restrict or terminate your use of our Site or Service.

We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review here:
