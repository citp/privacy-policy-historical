**Use of "cookies"**  
"Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use both session and persistent cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard, used to provide useful features for customers. Cookies, by themselves, do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of our website if you do so. For example, the complete online reservation process can only be accessed if you accept cookies. Currently, we do not tie cookie usage to personally identifiable information.
