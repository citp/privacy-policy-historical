We and our third-party service providers may collect Other Information from you, including your IP address, MAC address, your computer type, screen resolution, OS version, and Internet browser as well as information collected through the use of cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other similar technologies to better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing use of the Site. We and our third-party service providers may also collect Other Information such as demographic data (for example, your city or state) as well as aggregate PI in a manner such that the end product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site (for example, by using PI to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code). 

### Cookies

Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Site, pages visited, language preferences, navigation path, and products browsed. We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, remember you when you come back to the Site, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while visiting the Site (including to recommend products and offers to you based on your use of the Site), as well as for online tracking purposes. We can recognize your computer to assist your use of the Site. We also gather statistical information about the usage of the Site in order to continually improve the design and functionality, understand how customers use the Site, and to assist us with resolving questions regarding the Site. Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Site. We may also use cookies in online advertising to track consumer responses to our advertisements and we may use cookies or other files to track your use of other websites.

If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>. If you choose to decline cookies, then some or all of the features, functionality, and promotions available through the Site may not be available to you.

Because Other Information does not personally identify you, we may use Other Information for any purpose or share it with third parties. In some instances we may combine Other Information with PI, such as combining your zip code with your name. If we do combine any Other Information with PI, the combined information will be treated by us as PI as long as it is combined. If local law requires us to treat any of the Other Information as PI, we will comply with those laws.
