[**_Cookies & Other Tracking Mechanisms_**](http://www.gorkana.com/cookie-policy/)

**_Securing Your Personal Information_**

The security of your information is important to Cision, and we have implemented administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information against theft or misuse. Unfortunately, no system can guarantee complete security of your information. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information from unauthorized third parties, Cision cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information. Thus, your use of the Services and communications with us is at your own risk. You are responsible for protecting your username(s) and password(s) and for the security of information that you transmit to us over the internet. __

**_Children_**

Our Services are directed to working professionals. Our Services are not intended for children under 16 years of age or the relevant age of majority, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under that age. If you are under 13 years of age or the age of majority, you are not permitted to submit any personal information to us.

**_Third-Party_** _  **Information Collection**_

Our Services may contain links to third-party websites and services, including those of social media platforms, partner networks and advertisers. Please note that these websites and services may have their own privacy policies. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the policies of any third parties. If you chose to access any websites or services linked from our Services, please check the applicable policies before you use or submit any personal information to such website or service.

Third parties unaffiliated with us may also collect information about you, including tracking your browsing history, when you use our Services. We do not have control over these third-party collection practices and advise you to adjust the settings of your browsers or install plug-ins and add-ins if you wish to minimize these third party collections.

**_Personal Information Transferred from EEA and/or Switzerland_**

We may share your personal data with entities within the Cision Group. Given that we are an international organisation with our headquarters in the USA, this may involve transferring your personal data outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Some of the third parties to whom we transfer your personal data are also based outside of the EEA, so their processing of your personal data will likewise involve a transfer outside the EEA. Where your personal data is transferred outside of the EEA we will ensure that we appropriate mechanisms in place to ensure the protection of your personal information, including the use of specific contracts approved by the European Commission giving your personal data the same protection as it has in Europe.

Such transfers may be made by or to us in our capacity as a data processor or as a data controller:

  * **_Processor_** : Cision is a provider of software, services and tools intended to help customers manage all aspects of their marketing and PR campaigns. Cision does not own or control any of the information it processes on behalf of its customer. All such information is owned and controlled by Cision’s customer. In this capacity, Cision receives information transferred from the EU to the US merely as a processor on behalf of its customer, although such information may not be required by Cision.
  * **_Data Controller_** : Cision also provides information products designed to help customers research and plan their campaigns more effectively. In this function, Cision acts as a data controller of the personal information contained in these products and processes this personal information as a data controller.



Further details of transfers of personal data outside the EEA are provided in our [_Customer Privacy Notice_](https://gdpr.cision.com/dataprivacynotice_customersprospects) and our [_Data Privacy Notice – Influencers and Other Media Contacts_](https://gdpr.cision.com/dataprivacynotice_influencers).

**Legal Basis for Processing**

We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:

  * Where we need to process your information to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
  * Where we need to process your information to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
  * Where it is in our legitimate interests to do so. Our legitimate interests include our legitimate commercial interests in operating the Cision Services and providing you with access to our Media Database. We make sure that we consider and balance any potential negative impact on you and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you.
  * Where we have obtained your consent.



**Your rights**

If you reside in the EU, or if your personal information is processed in connection with one of our European businesses, you have certain rights under European data protection laws and in particular the General Data Protection Regulation.  These rights include rights of access; the right to rectification; the right to erasure; the right to restrict processing; the right to data portability; and the right to object to processing.

Your rights include the right to:

  * Access your personal information (via what is commonly known as a “data subject access request”).
  * Require us to correct any mistakes in your information which we hold.
  * Require the erasure of personal information concerning you in certain situations.
  * Receive the personal information concerning you which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to a third party in certain situations.
  * Object at any time to processing of personal information concerning you for direct marketing.
  * Object to decisions being taken by automated means (including profiling) which produce legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you.
  * Object in certain other situations to our continued processing of your personal information.
  * Otherwise restrict our processing of your personal information in certain circumstances.



In some cases these will not apply to you, or to the particular use that we are making of your data, and there are exceptions (for example if we have to process the data to comply with our own legal obligations).

For further information on each of these rights, including the circumstances in which they apply, you should refer to guidance from your local Data Protection Authority: <http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm>

You also have the right to make a complaint to your local data protection authority at any time.  We hope that we would be able to resolve any concerns that you may have before you approach your data protection authority so please do contact us in the first instance.

**_How long will we use your personal data?_**

We will keep your personal data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice and to fulfil our legal obligations. We will not keep more data than we need.

**_Changes to Our Privacy Policy_** _ _

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time to align with changes to our business practices and/or changes to our legal requirements. We will post the updated Privacy Policy on this page and will indicate that the updates have been made by changing the effective date first written above. We urge you to check back periodically to see whether there have been updates to our Privacy Policy.

Your continued use of the Services or communication with us about the Services after the updated Privacy Policy has been posted (or any other indication of your consent) will constitute your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.

Please note that we may condition your continued access to our Services on your consent to changes to this Privacy Policy.
