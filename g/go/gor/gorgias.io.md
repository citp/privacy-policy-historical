# Gorgias - Privacy policy

## Introduction

This privacy policy is designed to inform users of our proprietary products available at https://gorgias.io, including all sub-sites and micro-sites controlled by us, and any related smartphone or mobile application (collectively, the “Service”) about how Gorgias Inc. (“Gorgias”, “we” or “us”) gathers and uses personal information submitted to Gorgias through the Service. Gorgias will take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and with all applicable U.S. laws. In this policy, “user” or “you” means any person viewing the Service or submitting any personal information to Gorgias in connection with using the Service.

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time, and any changes will be posted on this page, and if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. If you have questions or concerns regarding the Privacy Policy, you should first contact us at support@gorgias.io.

Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including third party services used by Gorgias. For these third party services, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with the applicable third party privacy policies.
