        Cookies may also be used to help speed up your future activities at our

      </p><p>Site measurement

      </p><p>Some of the pages you visit may also collect information
		through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs) that may be shared

		shared with our third party advertising agency in order to better target
		Internet banner advertisements on Unilever web sites.&nbsp; The information collected through the
		use of these pixel tags is not, however, personally identifiable, although it
		could be linked to your Personal Information.
      </p><p>Finally, we may supplement the information that you provided us with 
        other information that we receive from third parties.&nbsp; We do this 
        for marketing purposes in order to provide more targeted products and
