We can then develop statistics that are helpful to understanding how this site is used by our visitors. This statistical data is interpreted by us in our continuing effort to present the web site content that visitors are seeking in a format they find most helpful.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">Community/Panel Members:&nbsp; </span></b><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">We may use your phone number and email address to send you invitations to participate in surveys and to contact you with messages regarding community/panel information and new opportunities. We may use your postal address to mail any survey-related materials, rewards, prizes and incentives and to assign you to demographic and geographic groups as required by research projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">We support the rights of those participating in our surveys/communities/panels by limiting the use of their information for legitimate marketing research purposes and are active in supporting the following organizations created to uphold ethical survey research (this support includes making reasonable effort to conform to the organizations’ ethical standards):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">American Marketing Association (AMA)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">Advertising Research Foundation (ARF)</span></li>

<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">We also strive to conform with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Safe Harbor regulations regarding data protection in the European Union; the FTCs Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the CAN-SPAM Act, and other privacy regulations and guidelines in the US and other countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">Your information is used solely for research purposes. We will never try to sell you anything; we are only interested in your opinions. When you complete a survey, your responses are analyzed in aggregate with all other respondents’ information and reported not individually, but only in the aggregate. Our research clients do not receive non-aggregated personal information of those participating in our surveys/communities/panels, nor do we identify participants to our clients, without your express permission, except for Media Clips, as defined below. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">When sharing your opinions, you may choose to provide us with your images, videos, and/or audio files (“Media Clips”).&nbsp; Media Clips may be given to the company sponsoring the research.&nbsp; Due to the nature of Media Clips, we may not be able to effectively combine your opinions with others in an anonymous way. Therefore, you waive any right to inspect or approve the use of your likeness/voice in subsequent reports/findings related to the study.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">You represent and warrant that any Media Clips that you provide contain your own original content or that you have secured all necessary permissions and licenses from any third parties having rights in the content of your Media Clips, including without limitation, any images, likenesses, voices, etc.&nbsp; In the event that a third party claims that Gongos or any of its employees, directors or agents violated its rights in a Media Clip you provide, you shall indemnify and hold Gongos, its employees, directors and agents from any such claims, including any final award or judgment, settlement and reasonable attorneys fees.</span></p>
<p class="standard-paragraph-heading">Updating Your Information</p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">We encourage you to update your contact information as it changes. To help you do this, we set up member accounts for all members. These can only be accessed via a password that you establish. You can update your information in the following ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">By sending an e-mail request to our members’ services team at: </span><span style="color: black;"><a href="mailto:panelservices@gongos.com"><span style="font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">panelservices@gongos.com</span></a></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">By visiting your member account via our community web site and following the instructions there.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">By phone at 248-239-2300, please ask for Panel Services.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">By postal mail to Attn: Panel Services, Gongos, Inc., 2365 Pontiac Road, Auburn Hills, MI 48326</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="standard-paragraph-heading">Children’s Privacy Protection</p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">We believe that it’s especially important to protect children’s privacy online and encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to participate and monitor their Internet activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">We strive to comply with all applicable national and international children’s privacy regulations, including The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.&nbsp; Children who are under 13 years of age are not permitted to become community/panel members without parental consent and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age without parental consent. Please note, however, that, as part of the registration process for new community/panel members, we may collect from the new community/panel member the names of each individual in the community/panel members’ household, which may include the names of children who are under 13 years of age. Occasionally we may send a survey to a community/panel member who is a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 that asks that community/panel member to have his or her child who is under 13 answer the survey. We seek parental consent to such procedure by sending the survey to the parent or guardian’s password- protected email address. The information collected in response to such surveys is not combined with identifying information about the child.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">If a community/panel member has provided us with personal information about a child in the community/panel member’s household who is under the age of 13, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us at the email address or mailing address listed at the bottom of this Privacy Policy if he or she would like this information deleted from our records. We will use reasonable efforts to delete the child’s information from our databases.</span></p>
<p class="standard-paragraph-heading">Links</p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">When taking a survey, you may have the opportunity to link to other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of those sites. We recommend that you carefully read the privacy policies of each site you visit.</span></p>
<p class="standard-paragraph-heading">Use of Cookies</p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">Like many other websites, we use cookies to provide a better experience for our members. We limit their use for quality control and validation. Cookies are used temporarily during the time you are actively completing a survey or filling out the registration forms and we do not store or retain your cookie information in any way.&nbsp; No PII is transmitted via these cookies.</span></p>
<p class="standard-paragraph-heading">How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">Gongos does not track survey/community/panel participants across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.</span></p>
<p class="standard-paragraph-heading">Data Security</p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">We take the security of your information seriously. We will not activate a potential registrant’s account without<br>
confirmation. Once the registration process is completed, the individual is sent an email requesting that he or she confirm his or her registration. The account will not be activated until confirmation is received. Additionally, all community/panel members are required to use their passwords and usernames (email addresses) when registering, updating their contact information, or when accessing “members only” sections of the websites. If you forget your password, you can send a message to our secure system to retrieve it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">Access to your PII is restricted and limited to select Company staff members who have a need to access such information to complete a legitimate business purpose, and access is subject to a strict password policy. Our employees receive training in data privacy and protection.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">We will never ask you for information such as credit card or bank account numbers, although we may be required by law to request your social security number when sending you a check for certain cash prizes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">We have security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">We employ commercially reasonable technology and internal processes to protect the information our members release to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">All surveys are screened by Company staff before sending you an invitation to ensure they are proper and appropriate for their intended audiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">While navigating our site, you may be directed to content or functionality that is hosted by a third party supplier, not on a Company-owned domain. When information is collected on behalf of Company exclusively, our privacy policy will be referenced on the site and will govern how your information is used. For sites not owned by us, the site owner’s privacy policy will be referenced.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">If, despite our security measures as described in this policy, we suffer a breach of our security systems and an individual or entity gains unauthorized access to any information stored on our servers, we will immediately investigate such security breach, and will provide prompt notice to any individual whose information was adversely affected.</span></p>
<p class="standard-paragraph-heading">Opting Out of Our Communities/Panels</p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">If you choose to end your membership in any of our communities/panels, you may automatically resign by clicking on&nbsp;</span><a href="http://gongos.com/RemoveMe.aspx"><span style="font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">http://gongos.com/RemoveMe.aspx</span></a><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">. In addition, in each email invitation sent to members of our respondent database, we provide the opportunity to opt-out of receipt of further mailings. If you choose to end your membership via either of these methods, your community/panelist membership record will be deactivated and you will no longer receive invitations from us, although you may continue to receive some previously-prepared invitations for a few days. We apologize for any such inconvenience.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">After you resign from our community/panel, we will continue to maintain your PII and Sensitive Data in our servers for historical and statistical purposes, as well as in our database of individuals who have unsubscribed from our community/panel to ensure that you do not receive further email survey invitations from us.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">Our current privacy protection terms will continue to protect your data even after your resignation.</span></p>
<p class="standard-paragraph-heading">Transfer of Information</p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">We reserve the right to transfer your PII and Sensitive Data to a buyer in connection with a sale of stock or assets, merger, or any other change of control transaction. Any acquirer would be required to honor our privacy policy.</span></p>
<p class="standard-paragraph-heading">Governing Law</p>
<p><b></b><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the State of Michigan, without regard to its conflicts of law principles.</span></p>
<p class="standard-paragraph-heading">Contacting Us</p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">Please contact us at </span><a href="mailto:panelservices@gongos.com"><span style="font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">panelservices@gongos.com</span></a><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;"> with any questions. We respond to most e-mail inquiries by the end of the following business day. You can also contact us by phone at 248-239-2300. Please ask for Panel Services or by postal mail at Attn: Panel Services, Gongos, Inc., 2365 Pontiac Road, Auburn Hills, MI 48326</span></p>
<p class="standard-paragraph-heading">Changes to This Policy</p>
<p><span style="color: #646464; font-family: Calluna Light; font-size: medium;">We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If we are going to use users’ PII and Sensitive Data in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email. If users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their PII or Sensitive Data be used in this new manner. Current community/panel members will be notified of any changes to this privacy policy via e-mail or via a message posted on our website.</span></p>
