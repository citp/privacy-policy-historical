# Privacy Policy – GoNoodle

Last updated: May 15, 2018

Welcome to GoNoodle, a website available at [www.gonoodle.com](http://www.gonoodle.com/) (the Site), and a mobile and set-top box applications (“Application”) (collectively, the “Services”). The Services are owned and operated by GoNoodle, Inc. (“GoNoodle”, “we”, “us” or “our”).

We created GoNoodle to get kids moving throughout the day at school and home. GoNoodle’s activities are available to teachers for use in the classroom and to kids outside the classroom. Your privacy and the privacy of children who use GoNoodle are important to us, and we created this Privacy Policy to inform you of the information we collect when you use the Services, how we use it, and how we share it with others. GoNoodle is committed to protecting your privacy, and has developed its privacy practices to align with applicable laws, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

GoNoodle is hosted and operated in the United States. If you use the Services from outside the United States, please be aware that the information you provide to us is transmitted to, processed and stored in the United States, and by using the Services you agree to this. Data will be protected subject to this Privacy Policy and applicable privacy laws in the United States and in the EU. These laws may be different from the privacy laws in your country. However, this does not change our commitments to safeguard your privacy, and we will comply with all applicable laws relating to the cross-border transfer of your personal information.

## INFORMATION WE COLLECT

### Information provided by users:

#### Educators:

When an educator registers, we collect first name, last name, email address, zip/postal code, password, and school name and address. We also collect your date of birth to verify your registration status, however we discard it once registration is complete.

Once an educator creates an account, they enter a class name, grade, and number of students in the class. Educators may also upload content, including YouTube videos and custom questions into their account.

#### Premium Services for Educators:

Educators who choose to upgrade to the premium version of GoNoodle will also be asked to provide their billing information, which we use to complete the purchase.

#### Families:

To create a family account, the parent or legal guardian registers by providing an email address, password, and zip code.

Children may register for GoNoodle. When a child registers with our Services, we ask for a parent’s email address. The parent will receive an email notifying them that their Child would like to register with GoNoodle and ask them to complete the account registration. If the parent proceeds, they will be asked to create a password for the account, provide a zip code, and accept the terms of services.

If the parent does not complete registration for their Child and consent to the child’s use of the service within 7 days of this notice (and we may send a reminder in that 7 day window), GoNoodle will delete all contact information from its records. During this 7 day period, the Child may view limited content on GoNoodle in an anonymous state without parental consent but after 7 days the temporary account will cease to function.

Through their account, parents may manage the Child’s account settings and deactivate the account completely.

#### Store:

When users make a purchase through the GoNoodle store, we collect a first and last name, email address, shipping address, billing address and credit card information, which we use in order to fulfill the purchase.

#### Communications:

Educators and parents have the option to provide an email address in order to sign up to receive email communications from GoNoodle about our products and services. Parents may also receive communications about their family’s use of GoNoodle. Users may opt out of these communications at any time via the “Opt Out Policy” as described below.

In addition, when users provide us with feedback through the “contact us” or other customer support forums, we will collect that information to respond to their concern.

#### Information we automatically collect from all users:
