# Privacy - Gong

**Last updated: October 3, 2018.**

We, at Gong I.O Ltd., put great efforts in making sure that your personal information is safe and used properly.

This policy explains our privacy practices for processing personal information on our data analytics services (the “ **Service** ” and “ **Customers** ”), and on our website at [gong.io](https://web.archive.org/) (“ **Website** “). We process your personal information subject to the terms of this policy.

## The Identifiable Information That You Provide

As a Customer representative, you may login to the Service, including through our Website. We will ask you to provide personal information, including your name, your company name, your email address and password.

When you, or someone on your behalf, contact our Customers, we may receive certain personally identifiable information that can be used to provide the Service or to contact or identify you. Personal information may include, but is not limited to, your name, mailing address, email address and telephone number.

When you contact us we may receive and process any personal information that you provide us.

## Customers’ Use of our Service

We provide speech analytics services. Our services enable our Customers to record, analyze and share for a limited period of time the recordings of phone calls, video calls and online demos, including associated data and documentation. The recordings and our analysis of the recordings may contain personal information.

## The Identifiable Information That We Collect

When you access the Website, our servers log certain ‘traffic/session’ information from your device, such as your user agent and the Internet Protocol (IP) address.

When you use the Website, we collect information about your Service activity, for example your log-in and log-out time, the duration of Service sessions, the content uploaded and downloaded, viewed web-pages or specific content on web-pages, activity measures and geo-location.

## What Do We Do with Identifiable Information?

We use the personal information we collect and receive to provide the Service to Customers, to enable the Service’s tools and features, to study and analyze the functionality of the Service, to provide support, to measure Service activity for pricing purposes, to maintain the Service, to make it better and to continue developing the Service.

We may use Customer’s email address to contact Customer when necessary, to send Customer reminders and to provide Customer information and notices about the Service. We may include commercial and marketing information.

We obey the law and expect you to do the same. If necessary, we may use your identifiable information to enforce our terms, policies and legal agreements, to comply with court orders and warrants, and assist law enforcement agencies, to collect debts, prevent fraud, misappropriation, infringements, identity thefts and any other misuse of the Service, and to take any action in any legal dispute and proceeding.

We commit to process personal information solely for the purposes described in this policy. To the extent relevant and possible, we will make efforts to maintain the information accurate, complete and up-to-date.

## Sharing Identifiable Information with Others

We provide our Customers with data analytics of calls and online demos that their personnel have conducted with clients and prospects. Customers are further provided access to the recordings for a limited period of time and they may share the access to the recordings internally and with relevant third parties.

We do not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information. We may share your identifiable information with service providers and other third parties, if necessary to fulfill the purposes for collecting the information, provided that any such third party will commit to protect your privacy as required under the applicable law and this policy.

We may also share personally identifiable information with companies or organizations connected, or affiliated with us, such as subsidiaries, sister-companies and parent companies, with the express provision that their use of such information must comply with this policy.

Additionally, a merger, acquisition or any other structural change may require us to transfer your personal information to another entity, provided that the receiving entity will comply with this policy.

We may be liable for onward transfers to third parties in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles. For further information, please below see the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield chapter of this policy.

## Disclosure of Information to Authorities

We may need to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

## Aggregated and Analytical Information

We may use analytics tools, including Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Mouseflow. These tools help us understand users’ behavior on our sites and applications, including by tracking page content, and click/touch, movements, scrolls and keystroke activities. The privacy practices of these tools are subject to their own policies and they may use their own cookies to provide their services. For further information about cookies, please see the ‘Cookies’ section in this policy. Further information about the privacy practices of our analytics service providers is available at: [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/); <https://mixpanel.com/terms/> and <https://mouseflow.com/terms/>.

Please note that if you get a new computer, install a new browser, erase or otherwise alter your browser’s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers), you may also clear the Mixpanel opt-out cookie.

From time to time, we may use additional or alternative analytics services. We will provide a notice of these changes on our website, and to our Customers through email or other available electronic means.

We use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information, which may be based on extracts of your personal information, for legitimate business purposes including for testing, development, control and operation of the Service. We may share such information with our partners. It has no effect on your privacy, because there is no reasonable way to extract data from the aggregated information that can be associated with you. We will share your identifiable information only subject to the terms of this policy, or subject to your prior consent.

At any time, you may choose (opt out) whether your personal information is (i) to be disclosed to a third party, other than to third parties who act as our agents to perform tasks on our behalf and under our instructions, or (ii) to be used for a purpose that is materially different from the purposes for which it was originally collected, pursuant to this policy, or subsequently authorized by you. You may exercise your choice by contacting us at: [privacy@gong.io](mailto:privacy@gong.io).

We may keep aggregated non-identifiable information without limitation, and to the extent reasonable we will delete or de-identify potentially identifiable information, when we no longer need to process the information.

In any case, as long as you use the Service, we will keep information about you, unless we are required by law to delete it, or if we decide to remove it at our discretion.

We and our hosting services implement systems, applications and procedures to secure your personal information, to minimize the risks of theft, damage, loss of information, or unauthorized access or use of information.

These measures provide sound industry standard security. However, although we make efforts to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee that the Service will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.
