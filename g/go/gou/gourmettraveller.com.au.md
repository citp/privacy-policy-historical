# Privacy Policy :: Gourmet Traveller

**Bauer Media Pty Limited: Privacy Policy**  
In this policy "we", "us' and "our" means Bauer Media Pty Limited, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies.

Please read this policy carefully as it describes the way in which we collect and handle your personal information.

We may update or revise this policy from time to time. If we elect to update or revise this policy, we will post the date on which that revision takes effect at the end of this policy.

Please be aware that you have no obligation to provide any personal information requested by us. However, if you choose to withhold your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with the services or products that depend on the collection and use of that information.

**1 Our privacy commitment**  
We recognise the importance of, and are committed to, managing any personal information that we collect in compliance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), which includes the Australian Privacy Principles, and other Australian privacy laws (together, "Privacy Laws").

As a member of the Australian Press Council ("APC"), we also ensure any personal information we collect in the course of our journalistic activities is managed in accordance with the APC Statement of Privacy Principles.

**2 How do we collect personal information?**  
Where possible, we collect your personal information directly from you. This collection includes through your:  
\- registration when you purchase a magazine or digital subscription;  
\- entry into promotions or competitions;  
\- answers to surveys;  
\- signing up to newsletters and other notifications from our magazines and other brands;  
\- signing up to join our online communities;  
\- registration to attend events;  
\- provision of express permission when accessing applications sitting on Bauer brand social media accounts;  
\- application for an internship or employment with us;  
\- communications with us such as letters, telephone calls, text messaging and emails regarding services and products;  
\- registration for our loyalty clubs; and  
\- download and use of our digital publications and mobile applications ("apps").

In some circumstances, however, we may also collect your personal information from third parties or public agencies where it is unreasonable or impracticable for us to collect the personal information directly from you. For example, if you subscribe to one of our magazines through a third party that is authorised to take subscriptions for us, we will collect your personal information from that third party. If we have difficulty in delivering a magazine to you, we may make enquiries in an effort to locate your address or correct any error in our recorded address details for you.

In some circumstances, we may provide you access to our online communities through the option of a third party platform sign on (including but not limited to, social sign ons). In this instance we will be accessing and collecting the personal information which you have authorised the third party platform to pass on to us. Where we collect personal information from third parties, we will ensure that the collection is conducted in a fair and lawful manner and the information is reasonably necessary for our functions or activities.

**3 What personal information do we collect?**  
The personal information we collect varies depending upon the purpose of the collection and the product or service we are providing you. Generally, we collect and hold the following types of personal information:  
\- your name and address;  
\- your telephone e-mail contact details;  
\- your date of birth;  
\- your gender;  
\- other information you may make publically available online (including but not limited to on social media platforms);  
\- transaction details, if you make a purchase with us or choose to store details in your online profile;  
\- bank account/credit card numbers and associated details as reasonably required in relation to processing payments at your request; and  
\- any other personal information which may be required in order to facilitate and where possible improve your dealings with us.

However, for certain purposes, such as where you apply for employment with us, we will collect additional personal information such as your employment history, educational history and employment references.

We generally do not collect sensitive information that is associated with an identifiable individual.  
We may from time to time collect information that would be sensitive personal information about you with your consent where the collection is related to provision of a service or other benefit to you. For example, we collect information from expectant mothers in relation to them and their families with their consent, in order to provide them with baby products and associated maternity benefits.  
We may collect information from you about particular health concerns, gender orientation or other sensitive information with your consent, in order to provide you with offers or promotions related to your concerns or status.

In the event that we are required to collect sensitive personal information, we will notify you of this at the point of collection and obtain your consent to collect and hold this sensitive personal information.

If you provide us with sensitive information on an unsolicited basis, we assess whether such information is reasonably necessary for one or more of our functions or activities. The unsolicited sensitive information you disclose to us may be used and disclosed for the purpose for which you provided such information or, where you would reasonably expect us to, we may use the information for a directly related secondary purpose. We may also disclose or use the information for other purposes with your consent or if required to by law.

**4 Why do we collect and use your personal information?**  
We will collect your personal information if it is reasonably necessary for the performance of our business activities and functions, which includes providing a range of products and services to you, some of which are listed below.

We will also seek your consent to send to you Magshop promotional material and special offers. Where you have a subscription for a magazine published by us, then we will also send you that magazine's regular newsletter as well as promotional material and occasionally (where notice has been given) you may also be sent special offers from third parties associated with that title. .

**4.2 Sales Promotions, Competitions, Surveys and registration to attend our events**  
We collect personal information when you respond to one of our promotions, competitions or surveys or when you register to attend an event in order to inform you if you have won a prize, to place you on a guest-list to the event and to help us better understand what products and services you would like to receive information about in the future.

**4.3 Our mobile apps**  
We, or a service provider, may collect information through our apps to assist us in understanding how you use our apps, how the apps are performing across different handsets and to assist us in the selection of advertisements for groups of individuals.

In addition, the marketing communications that we send to you will also contain information on how to unsubscribe from those communications.

You can also tell us at any time if you do not want us to disclose your details to other organisations such as our related companies or third parties for marketing purposes. To do this, you just need to contact our Privacy Officer.

Sometimes we extract information from our collected records to produce aggregated data. This aggregated data does not identify individuals. We use the aggregated data for research purposes, product development and may share the data with third parties.

As such, we take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We store information both at an onsite secure server and at trusted third party storage providers.
