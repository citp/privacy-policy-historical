                    <p>This Privacy Policy describes the  terms of our commitment to your privacy.</p>
                    <p><strong>PERSONS OR PARTIES  COVERED&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>This Privacy Policy is intended to  cover all visitors to this website, all subscribers to lists or newsletters  whether paid or unpaid, all members or affiliates whether paid or unpaid, and  all customers.&nbsp; Persons who visit or view this website, whether  intentionally or unintentionally, whether solicited or unsolicited, are  described herein as "Visitors" and are parties to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;  Subscribers to lists or Newsletters are referred to herein as  "Subscribers" and are parties to the Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Persons  who join an organization or marketing endeavor (e.g. "affiliates")  promoted by this website are called "Members" herein and are covered  by this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Finally, anyone who orders, attempts to order, or  receives a product sold (recipients) or advertised on or delivered from this  website, even at no cost, is called a "Customer" herein and is  subject to this Privacy Policy not only by passive acceptance, but by virtue of  the Purchase Agreement contract.&nbsp; The website, its agents, owners,  operators, and employees are referred to collectively herein as  "Website," "Site," and/or "Seller".</p>
                    <p><strong>PERSONS EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE  ARE STILL COVERED</strong> <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>In the event that a person excluded  from this website because of the Terms of Use or from denial of service by the  website, who nonetheless unlawfully views this site, that person remains  subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and is in violation of the Terms of  Use.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>PERSONS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE ARE  EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE</strong> <br>
                      </p>
                    <p><u>This website is not lawfully  accessible to persons under the age of 18 or who are otherwise covered by the  provisions of the Child Online Privacy Act of 1998 (COPA).&nbsp; If you are  under the age of 18 you must leave this site immediately.&nbsp; Fraudulent use  of this website may make you subject to civil or criminal sanctions.</u> <br>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>VIEWING AND/OR USE AND/OR  COMMUNICATION IS CONSTRUED AS ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY</strong> <br>
                      </p>
                    <p>Acceptance of the terms of this  Privacy Policy is a portion of the consideration required for your right to  visit the website.&nbsp; If you do not accept these terms, you have no right to  visit this site and you are fraudulently using this site.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS  WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED</strong> <br>
                      </p>
                    <p>This website routinely collects  information about its visitors, subscribers, members, and customers.&nbsp; This  information is obtained in various ways, such as:<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM  'REGISTRATION'</strong><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Registration means that the Visitor,  Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active, positive steps to communicate  information to this website.&nbsp; This can include pages or 'pop ups' where  you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can include  your participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting information  from the website via email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining an  affiliate program or other membership organization, paid or unpaid; it may be  from ordering a product.<br>
                      Occasionally complete credit card information may be provided to the website  via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant service  processing.&nbsp; This information is kept at the highest level of security and  is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service provider or for the  purpose of communication with the customer.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>ONLINE ORDERING</strong> <br>
                      </p>
                    <p>Online ordering via SSL encrypted  communication provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant service  companies like Visa and Master Card provides information to the website but  does not provide complete credit card numbers.&nbsp; In the process of online  ordering, the customer provides: &nbsp;name, address, city, state, email  address, phone number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and, occasionally, a member  password.&nbsp; You should consider all this information available to the  website.&nbsp; This information is used to deliver the product, but under the  Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes  to the extent allowed by law.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES</strong> <br>
                      </p>
                    <p>Website visitors who wish to  communicate with the website do so under two conditions:&nbsp; one, they give  their permission for contact by the website; two, they are subject to any  ‘submission’ provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this  Privacy Policy.&nbsp; While your email address may or may not be used to  solicit you, it is added to the website's general solicitation database.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS</strong> <br>
                      </p>
                    <p>If you are a customer and send an  email to the website, or if you communicate with the site by phone or mail, the  website collects information about your communication and by communicating with  the site you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise  use any information collected as the site sees fit.<br>
                      Any communication which, in its sole discretion, the site deems to be a  testimonial, may be publicized for commercial purposes.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR  INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS, OR SITE ADVERTISERS</strong> <br>
                      </p>
                    <p>Visitors clicking on banners or  pop-ups or hyperlinked advertising, appearing on this website must assume that  information is being collected about them.&nbsp; This site is not responsible  for the use of information collected in such a fashion.&nbsp; Visitors must  assume that (1) information will be collected, (2) that ‘cookies’ will usually  be placed on their hard drive, (3) that website does not have any control over  what happens with this information, (4) that website takes no responsibility  over the accuracy or content of advertisers, (5) that website is not  responsible for downloads from third party advertisers that contain viruses or  worms or other computer code that causes their computer or software harm, and  (6) that website assumes no responsibility for the data that is garnered from  the click itself or that the advertiser collects. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM REFERRING  EMAIL OR REFERRING URLS</strong> <br>
                      </p>
                    <p>If you send a friend an email from  this site or if you send the url or one of our web pages to a friend, you must  assume that some data is collected about your IP address or your email address  and that of your friend.&nbsp; You must assume that referred emails or web  pages may appear to come from your email.&nbsp; You must accept fully  responsibility for referring pages or email to a friend and agree to indemnify  this site for any damage, intentional or unintentional that results from said  referrals.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VOLUNTARY  VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER OR CUSTOMER SURVEYS</strong> <br>
                      </p>
                    <p>Unless otherwise specified in the  survey, you must assume that any information provided to the website as part of  a survey in which you participate may be used for general solicitation for  commercial purposes and that such information will be shared with joint venture  partners, affiliates, marketing organization or used by the site itself for  product design or solicitation purposes.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ELECTRONIC  MEANS AND 'COOKIES'</strong> <br>
                      </p>
                    <p>Many websites, including this one,  collect information about your computer, your email address, your IP  address.&nbsp; You must assume that your web-viewing or web-use activity is  monitored, tracked, and information collected.&nbsp; This information is not  usually of a personal nature, but it may help define your viewing habits and  product preferences even though the website may or may not have any idea who  you are.<br>
                      "Cookies" is web jargon for bits of computer code placed on your hard  drive.&nbsp; Websites use this to keep you 'logged in', to keep track of search  criteria, to monitor use, to password protect use of the site or use of  products sold by the site.&nbsp; Cookies can also be used to obtain information  about your computer configuration or your use of your computer.<br>
                      Cookies can be used to electronically gather information about you.&nbsp;  Again, it may or may not be personal information, but it is information and by  using this site you are expressly giving permission to use 'cookies' and to use  the information gathered from their use to benefit you.&nbsp; You also give  permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and use any information collected for  product design, product offers to you, and general commercial solicitation  purposes by this site or joint venture partners, affiliates, and marketing  organizations.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>HOW INFORMATION MAY BE USED</strong> <br>
                      </p>
                    <p>The use of information as described  below may or may not be how information that is collected is customarily used  by this site.&nbsp; While actual use of any information collected may be used  quite conservatively, you must assume that it is not.&nbsp; You must assume  that information collected is shared with other persons or entities for  commercial purposes.&nbsp; While this is uncommon in practice, you must assume  that it is as you make your decision whether or not to view or interact with  this website.&nbsp; This type of shared information may include your name,  address, phone number, email address and buying habits, as well as other  information.&nbsp; This information may be used for general commercial  solicitation by this website or other persons it is sold to, rented to, or  shared with.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>INFORMATION THAT IS NOT SHARED</strong> <br>
                      </p>
                    <p>Credit card information or other  financial information is not usually known to the website.&nbsp; However, in  the event that it is made known, that information is never revealed to anyone  except to processing authorities or law enforcement agencies.&nbsp; However,  the provider of such information gives express permission to use it in fraud  investigation or for litigation.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>BULLETIN BOARDS AND PUBLIC FORUMS</strong> <br>
                      </p>
                    <p>Visitors, subscribers, members, or  customers who use any site provided bulletin boards or other public forums,  such as chat rooms, do so at their own risk.&nbsp; You may not assume that the  site monitors these services or protects you in any manner from information you  post publicly or share with anyone else via these services.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>SPAM&nbsp; </strong> <br>
                      </p>
                    <p>By providing to this website  information that forms the basis of communication with you, such as an email  address, you waive all rights to file complaints concerning unsolicited email  or spam from this website since, by providing such information, you agree to  receive communication from us or other marketing organizations.&nbsp; However,  all email communication with you shall contain an 'unsubscribe' link where you  may notify the website that you no longer wish to receive solicitations or  information from the website and your name will be removed from the general  solicitation database.<br>
                    </p>
