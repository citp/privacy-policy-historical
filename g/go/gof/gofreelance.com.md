**Orders**  
Visitors can choose to upgrade to Professional Membership (paid subscription) by signing up through our order pages. We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the customer. We use third-party payment processors (iBill and Verotel) to handle payments. See the Sharing section for further information.

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use cookies to ensure that a popup newsletter subscription window is only seen once by each visitor, no matter how often the visitor returns. Visitors who refuse to accept cookies will see the popup window each time they visit. 

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze visitor trends and administer the site only. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Any subscriber can ask to be removed from the list at any time. Each mailing from Go Freelance includes a 'remove' link, which allows the subscriber to unsubscribe with a single click. Alternatively, subscribers can send an email to support@gofreelance.com and ask to be removed. 

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
