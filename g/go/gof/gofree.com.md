**How We Use Your Information**  
Our primary goal is to make our Services more useful to you. By knowing about you, we are able to deliver relevant Services and Offers. We maintain a secure database of all Information collected on our Sites and Services.

We compile and analyze this information on an aggregated basis. We may also share this aggregated data with current and potential Partners.

Third Parties and Advertising. Third parties advertise on our Sites, and we also contract with third parties to serve ads across the Internet. These third parties may serve ads about our products or services, or third party products or services in which, based on your Session Data, we or our business partners believe you may be interested. These third parties may seek to use cookies and pixel tags, including those collected on our Site, to track Session Data about the ads you have seen and types of things in which you appear interested. These third parties may also use combined information about your visits to our Site and other sites in order to provide advertisements about related goods and services that may be of interest to you. You can opt-out of the third party advertising program by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative website http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp. Opting out of a network does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns.  
When you click on a third party advertisers' link from our Site, you will be taken off of our Site and will enter the third party's site. We are not responsible for such third party's sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other site you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to that site, and may be very different from our policy.

**Sharing Your Personal Information with Partners.**  
The following describes some of the ways that we may disclose your information to our Partners:

Search Partners. We may transmit your search queries (made on the Site or within one of our Software Offers) to search Partners, who use this information to provide us with search results, which we then will display to you.

Third-Party Advertisements and Software. When you request or submit your information online to a Partner in response to any Offer, we may transfer your information for each request made to that Partner. If we transfer your Personally Identifiable Information, such information becomes subject to the Partners’ privacy policy.

Our Products. We do not require you to provide Personally Identifiable Information during the installation process. However, when you use any of our Partners’ Software Offers you may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information. 

Other Limited Circumstances. From time to time, we may validate the information in our database by employing a validation service. In those instances, we will disclose your information pursuant to confidentiality agreements. In addition, we disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users are female) when we market to current and prospective Partners and for other lawful purposes.

Legal Disclosure: We may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our policies or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights, property, users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain service, and improve our Products and Services.

Sale, Merger or Asset Transfer. We may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions.
