  2. Go90 App Privacy Policy



The [go90 app](http://www.go90app.com/learn) allows you to view videos, clips, live events, images and other content; create, save and share video clips (called “cuts”); establish a profile and share your favorite cuts with friends; create groups to share content with people who have similar tastes or interests (called “crews”); follow people and crews you like; and post comments. go90’s collection and use of information is covered by the [Verizon privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy) as well as go90-specific practices described here.

Each go90 user creates a profile consisting of user name and picture (if you choose to add one). The profile will also show any cuts you create, crews you join and comments you post. Other go90 users can view profiles and may copy or share profile information associated with you outside of go90 via texting, email and sharing in other social media. You can add additional information to your profile if you choose, such as your name, and that additional information will also be publicly available. You can modify your profile including deleting your own cuts or comments.
