Cookies also help us to learn about how and when people use our website so that we can determine which parts of our website are popular and which need to be modified to be more useful. Although cookies do identify a website user's computer, cookies alone cannot personally identify a user.

  
Your Web browser only allows us to access the cookies we have already sent to your computer, not the cookies that other websites have sent. We do not and cannot use cookies to retrieve any information from your computer that we did not put there in the first place.

## D. Collection of Personal Information from Children

HVCB believes that it is extremely important to protect children's personal information. As such, HVCB does not collect any personal information that can be identified with anyone under the age of 16. In fact, as discussed in our Terms and Conditions of Use, no one under the age of 16 is allowed to use any features of this website that result in our actively collecting personal information, such as the personalized "My Hawaii" website feature.

## III. What Does HVCB Do with the Information It Collects?

The primary reason why we collect information from you is to provide you with the services that you request and to enhance your experience at our website. Services such as the personalized "My Hawaii" website and the free mailing of the Islands of Aloha vacation planner would be impossible without the personal information that you provide to us. We also use the information we collect to make sure that our website provides you with the resources you need and the level of quality you expect. For example, information about the sections of the website that people visit most frequently and least frequently helps us to decides which features website users find useful and which features need some changes.

  
In addition to our internal use of the information we collect, your personal information is used to help make sure that you receive all the information you need to make your stay in Hawaii as pleasant as possible. One way we do this is by using your e-mail address to send you periodic updates about Hawaii. We also sometimes share your name and postal address with companies that we believe you might be interested in hearing from. These companies might contact you directly to let you know about special deals and unique opportunities that could make your vacation in Hawaii more enjoyable.

  
While we believe that the more information you have about Hawaii the more likely you are to enjoy your visit, we also understand that you value your privacy. If you would prefer that HVCB not e-mail you any periodic updates about Hawaii and/or not share any personally identifiable information about you with any third party, all you need to do is tell us. Just e-mail us at info@hvcb.org or telephone us at 808.923.1811 and let us know about your preference.

  
Please be advised, however, that we reserve the right to disclose any personal information about you without your prior consent if we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to: (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with valid legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order; (2) protect our rights or property; (3) enforce the provisions of the Terms and Conditions of Use; or (4) prevent harm to you or others.

  
Also, HVCB sometimes shares with third parties certain nonpersonal, summary information about the people who use our website. This information is not personally identifiable in any way and consists of facts such as the average numbers of visitors to our website per day and the most popular sections of our website.

## IV. What Kind of Security Does HVCB Use to Protect Your Privacy?

We know that when you provide us with any type of information, you're trusting us to keep it safe from unauthorized intrusion. We take all reasonable steps, through the use of updated security software and protocols, to ensure that your personal information is safe.

## V. What Do You Need to Do to Protect Your Personal Information?

You have several options when deciding how you can best protect your personal information. One option is simply not to volunteer any personal information. This approach would prevent you from taking advantage of several of our website's most useful features, such as the personalized "My Hawaii" website.

  
Another option is to configure your Web browser to refuse all new cookies, to notify you whenever you are about to receive a new cookie, or to disable cookies completely. However many parts of our website will not function properly if you do not allow cookies.

  
The Federal Trade Commission's website also offers useful information about how to protect your personal information while on the Internet.
