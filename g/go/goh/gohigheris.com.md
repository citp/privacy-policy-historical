This information assists us to improve the structure of our website and monitor their performance.

### COOKIES

Go Higher makes use of cookies on this website. Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to a Visitors hard drive for record-keeping purposes. The browser stores the information, and sends the information back to the server each time a Visitor request a webpage from the server. The use of cookies is an industry standard and are used by the majority of Website operators.

By keeping a record of how and when Visitors view our website, cookies help us see which web pages are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to our website are based on such data as the total number of Visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide products and services that are better tailored to our Visitors and Visitors needs.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. Visitors can reset their browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.

Go Higher web servers register the type of web browsers that Visitors are using and their IP address when Visitors access our website.  Go Higher collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate traffic information to our Visitors, fraud detection and to generally audit the use of our website. When Visitors request pages from our website, our servers may log the Visitor’s IP addresses.  Go Higher does not normally link IP addresses to any personal information, which means that a Visitor’s session will be logged, but the Visitor otherwise remains anonymous, unless in support tickets or forum.  Go Higher can and will make use of IP addresses to identify a Visitor when it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms of service or to protect the integrity of our services and website, as well as to protect our interests and those of our Visitors.

While rare, this may occur when:

  * Compelled by law enforcement to provide such information
  * When we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against the Visitor or another person who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of Go Higher, other Visitors or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.
  * When required by law.
