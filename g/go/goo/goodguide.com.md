# Privacy Policy | GoodGuide

GoodGuide offers products and services that include our website at GoodGuide.com and mobile applications (collectively, the “Services”). GoodGuide knows that you care about how your personal information is collected, used and shared so we take many steps to protect your privacy. This document (the “Privacy Policy”) sets forth our practices and policies with respect to our collection, use and sharing of personal information through your use of the Services. Your use of the Services constitutes acknowledgement that that you have read this Privacy Policy and accept its terms. Please do not use the Services if you do not want the Privacy Policy to apply to you.

## What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy covers treatment of information that GoodGuide may gather when you access or use the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to sites or services owned, operated or controlled by third parties. Information that you provide to such third parties and their sites or services will be subject to the privacy policies of such sites or services.

## What Information Does GoodGuide Collect?

Information You Provide to Us. In order to use certain Services or to access the full features of certain Services you may be required to register with us (and give us personal information such as your name and email address). You can choose not to provide us with such personal information, but then you will not be able to use or take advantage of some of the Services.

The information that you provide is also used to customize the content you see and to communicate with you about our Services and new products. If you provide personal information to us through one of our Services, we may use it for these purposes in connection with other Services; for example, if you provide your email address to us in connection with a GoodGuide Service you are giving us permission to use that email address in order to respond to your requests, advise you about other services, and so forth.

Information Collected Automatically. We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Services. GoodGuide automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser or mobile device, including your IP address or mobile location, cookie information, and the page or portion of the Services that you requested.

GoodGuide also automatically tracks users’ interactions with the Services. These interactions include product or brand searches or scans, user-submitted content contributions (e.g., recommendations/avoids or comments), social media activity (e.g. shares/likes) or e-commerce activity (e.g., additions to shopping carts and checkouts). GoodGuide uses these data to personalize our Services for you.

We have implemented Google Analytics features based on Display Advertising (Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting). You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Settings or NAI’s consumer opt-out. In addition, you can use the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on to disable tracking by Google Analytics. We will use the data provided by Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to develop the site and content around our users’ interests. Any other use of automatically collected information occurs only in aggregate form. Automatically collected and aggregated data enables GoodGuide to understand how users are accessing and using the Services so that we can improve them and focus our efforts on popular features.

## Will GoodGuide Share the Information it Collects?

Information You Provide. GoodGuide does not rent, sell, or share the information you provide, such as name and email address, with other companies for any purpose. While we do not rent, share, or sell the information you provide to advertisers, we may utilize the information within our systems to customize the delivery of marketing content or product promotions that will be of greatest relevance, value, and interest to you.

Information Collected Automatically. GoodGuide may share aggregate, automatically collected information with others to help improve the Services and third party services and products. GoodGuide is able to provide product and company sustainability ratings free to consumers through the display of advertising on our site. We use Google’s Doubleclick for Advertisers to serve our ads, and some advertisers also collect information through Neilsen. You can read more about how Google and Neilsen use data collected on GoodGuide, and how to control the information you share by clicking these links: [Google](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners) and [Nielsen](http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy). You can also select not to share your data for interest-based advertising by opting out [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

Contractors. GoodGuide may contract with other companies (e.g., for data analysis, email services or other specialties) to perform tasks on our behalf. We may need (and you are authorizing us) to share your information, including personal information, with them for the limited purpose of allowing us to fulfill these tasks. We bind these contractors to agreements that prohibit them from using or disclosing any information they receive from GoodGuide for any purposes except the ones they are hired to provide to us.

Legal Compliance. GoodGuide reserves the right to disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to (1) comply with the law; (2) enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or (3) protect the rights, property or safety of GoodGuide, our employees, our users, or others.

Business Transfers. If a third party acquires GoodGuide or GoodGuide goes out of business, information would be one of the assets that could be transferred to or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of GoodGuide may continue to use all information, including personal information, as long as it does so only as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

How Secure is My Information?

GoodGuide has put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in an effort to safeguard our Services, help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and use the personal information we collect from you in compliance with this privacy policy.

Can I Access or Change My Information?

As a registered user, we will provide you with a password-protected personal account, where you can maintain your profile. It is your responsibility to select an appropriate password for this account, to change it regularly and to ensure that your password is not disclosed to others.

How Do You Use Cookies and Similar Tools?

GoodGuide uses cookies and similar tools to track session data and allow us to personalize your experience of the Services. We do not use cookies or other tools to collect or reveal personal information to GoodGuide. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, or erasing existing cookies. If you elect to turn off cookies, GoodGuide will not be able to store cookies on your system or collect information from them. As a result, you will not be able to use the personalized features of the Services that depend on cookies and the information they contain.

Some of our advertisers may use cookies in the content they provide for publication within the GoodGuide Services, as may the owners of websites or other services where our Services are available. GoodGuide has no access to or control over the use of cookies by any advertisers or owners of third-party websites or other services.

Other Sites and Services

The Services may contain links or otherwise make it possible for you to access other websites and services. These other sites and services are not owned or controlled by GoodGuide. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites or services.

Country-Specific Restrictions

The Services are hosted by GoodGuide from the United States. If you provide personal information to us, it may be transferred to and processed on computers in the United States and other countries. If you provide personal information to us, you hereby consent to this information being transferred to the United States or outside of your country, even if the laws in your country have restrictions on these types of transfers. Your provision of personal information to us will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your provision of personal information to us through the Site means that you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights

California law permits customers of GoodGuide who are California residents to request and receive the identity of any third parties to whom GoodGuide has disclosed personal information within the previous calendar year, along with the type of personal information disclosed, for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Because it is GoodGuide’s policy not to share your personal information with such third parties unless you are first given the opportunity to opt-out from such sharing, we are exempt from having to meet this requirement.

What if You Change the Privacy Policy?

This Privacy Policy is a living document. GoodGuide may amend the Privacy Policy as we add new features to the Services, or as the law or circumstances change. Accordingly, we reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to the Privacy Policy we will post those changes here and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of the changes.
