# Google Page Creator Privacy Policy

Version February 23, 2006

The [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacy.html) describes how we treat personal information when you use Google's services, including information provided to Google Page Creator.  In addition, the following describes our practices that are specific to Google Page Creator.

**Personal Information**

  * You need a [Google Account](http://www.google.com/privacy_faq.html#account) to use Google Page Creator. Google asks for some personal information when you create a Google Account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. A Google Account allows you to access many of our services that require registration.
  * Google stores, processes and maintains your pages and other files in order to provide the service to you.
  * When you use Google Page Creator, Google's servers automatically record certain information about your use of Google Page Creator. Similar to other web services, Google records information such as account activity (including storage usage, number of log-ins), data displayed or clicked on (including UI elements, links); and other [log information](http://www.google.com/privacy_faq.html#serverlogs) (including browser type, IP-address, date and time of access, cookie ID, and referrer URL). 



**Uses**

  * Information you post on a Google Page Creator site may be read, copied, used and re-distributed by people you do not know.  Use care when posting personal information on any site and do not include sensitive information, such as social security numbers, financial information or home addresses or phone numbers. 



**Your choices**

  * You may terminate your use of Google Page Creator and stop your Google Page Creator site from being available through Google. To do so, go to the Google Page Creator home page, select all pages, and choose "Unpublish" from the "More actions…" dropdown.
