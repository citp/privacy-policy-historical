We do not ordinarily collect financial information such as credit card details.

Occasionally where a user does not have a Paypal account and wishes to pay by phone, we will collect (but not store) your credit card details.

**Cookies**

Like most websites we use cookies on our website. A cookie is a text file sent by a website to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the website each time the browser requests a page from the site. This enables the website to identify and track the web browser. 

We may send a cookie which may be stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of this website, to improve the website’s usability and for marketing purposes. We may also use that information to recognise your computer when you visit our website, and to personalise our website for you. Our advertisers may also send you cookies. 

Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one. 

We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of our websites. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users’ computers. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. Google’s privacy policy is available [here](http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html).
