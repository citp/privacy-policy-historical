Analytics: We use collected data for monitoring and reporting the effectiveness of the campaign  
delivery to our business partner and for internal business analysis.  
Re/Targeting: We use data to filter the ad delivery according to the context (page content, website  
name,etc) and the user profile (socio-demographic, geolocation, interest, behavior, etc). This is based on data we do collect directly or from a third party. Teads analyses the products viewed, the search made by the visitor and/or pages visited and may link them with third party data information. This targeting may also be done by the DSP partners. In this case, Teads sends those information in the bid request.  
User frequency Capping: We use data to cap the frequency and volume of the same ad delivered to the same user.  
Ad Delivery: They transmit collected data for ad delivering and campaign tracking to our business  
partners. This does not provide the granularity at the user level.  
Delivery Algorithm training: We use data which is anonymized, so as not to be identifiable to a  
specific source, and aggregated, so as not to be identifiable to any individual transaction in order to improve our service and technology.  
Confidential Data transmitted to 3rd-party: To operate our services, Teads uses partners for analytics, targeting, brand safety, fraud detection, viewability measurement, campaign delivery tracking or others partners that may help them to deliver and measure the quality of our service.  
Cross device experience: To provide a consolidated experience through the different devices or  
browser environments, they may link the Teads identifiers on the different browsers and environments the user is using.
