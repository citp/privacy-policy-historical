We do employ other types of cookies that we call "performance" or "functionality" cookies; we use these, as do some third parties with which we work, to follow the interests of our visitors. They enable us, and third parties, to analyze website use, target advertising, etc. In addition, we may also use "marketing cookies" to make ads more relevant and useful.
