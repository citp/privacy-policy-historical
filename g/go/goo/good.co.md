 **Scope**

This Privacy Shield Policy applies to any personal information received by us from the European Union in reliance on Privacy Shield.

When we use the term “sensitive personal information”, we are referring to information about an individual’s race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or that concerns his or her health.

The type of personal information which we collect and the purposes for which we use it are described in our website [privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy/).

 **Principles**

  1.  **Notice.** We will provide you with notice of our data collection and processing practices in our [privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy/), including describing what personal information we collect, how we use that information, the categories of third parties with whom we may share such information (and the purposes for which we do so), the individual’s right to access such information, the choices and means through which the individual may limit the use and disclosure of personal information, and other disclosures consistent with the notice principle.
  2.  **Choice.** If we wish to (i)disclose your personal information to a third party (other than to a service provider who is acting on our instructions) or (ii) use it for a purpose materially different from the purposes for which it was originally collected, as set out in our Privacy Policy, we will:
    1. Offer you the opportunity to opt-out of such disclosure or use; or
    2. In the case of sensitive personal information, not disclose or use your personal information in this way unless we have your affirmative consent.
  3.  **Onward transfers (transfers to third parties).** We may transfer personal information to certain third parties, as described in our Privacy Policy. Where we transfer personal information to a third party, we will take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the third party processes personal information for limited and specified purposes and in a manner consistent with our Privacy Shield obligations. Where the transfer is to a third party agent acting on our behalf, we may be liable if such third parties fail to meet those obligations, and we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
  4.  **Data security.** We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.

  6.  **Access.** Upon request, we will provide you with reasonable access to the personal information about you that we hold. We will also take reasonable steps to correct, update, amend or delete any information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of doing so would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question or where the rights of third parties would be violated.
  7.  **Jurisdiction and Enforcement.** As part of our participation in Privacy Shield, we are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission.
  8.  **Lawful Requests.** We may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
