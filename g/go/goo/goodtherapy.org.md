Our employees must use password-protected logins to access this server. Each time they return, they must re-enter their password to regain access to user information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified about what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment in a locked building.
