<h2>GOODMagazine.com Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Last Updated:  December 6, 2006</p>

<p>SUMMARY</p>

<p>At GOOD Magazine LLC ("GOOD") we take the privacy of our members very seriously.
Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about how we treat personally
identifiable information. We provide this Privacy Policy because you have a
right to know what information we collect, how it is protected and used, and the
circumstances under which it may be disclosed. If you have comments,
suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us
via email at <a href="mailto:webeditor@GOODMagazine.com">webeditor@GOODMagazine.com</a>, or in writing at: Web Director, GOOD
Magazine LLC, 9155 West Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, California 90069. </p>

<p>Online Privacy Standards.  While there are no official standards governing
privacy practices on the internet, we follow the principles supported by the
Federal Trade Commission's Fair Information Practices Principles, currently
available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.htm">http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.htm</a>.</p>

<p>What This Policy Covers.  This policy covers GOOD's treatment of personally
identifiable information that we obtain when you visit our website, subscribe to
GOOD Magazine, or become a member of GOODMagazine.com. We regard personally
identifiable information as information that someone can use to identify or
contact you in person, such as real name, telephone number, birth date, email
address, or physical mailing address. Information that we use internally to
identify you as a member in our system, such as your selected username, is not
considered personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>What This Policy Does Not Cover.  This policy does not cover the privacy
practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as our partners
and advertisers. In addition, we may provide links to other services and on
occasion to other sites that may interest you. All of these sites operate
independently of GOOD and they have their own privacy or security practices. For
your best on-line experience, we encourage you to review their policies before
submitting any personal information to them.</p>

<p>HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED</p>

<p>1.	Information You Provide.</p>

<p>Required Registration Information.  During the registration process, we collect
your email address, and your birth date. We will send you an email to verify
that you are the owner of this address. You will also choose a username that we
will use to identify you in our system.</p>

<p>Optional Member Profile Information.  You can choose to provide us with
additional optional information about yourself in your member profile, for
example you can submit biographical information and a photo of yourself. </p>

<p>Access To Your Personal Information.  In general, we make it easy for you to
view the personally identifiable information we have collected from you in your
member profile, where you can add, edit, or delete it as you see fit. </p>

<p>Information Submitted During A Transaction.  During a payment transaction (for
example, when you purchase a subscription to GOOD Magazine through this
website), we collect information including your name, shipping and billing
address(es), email address, telephone number, and credit card information. This
information is collected and used to process your payment transaction, and also
for shipping your GOOD magazine subscription to you.</p>

<p>2.	Information We Do Not Collect.</p>

<p>Children.  As explained further in our Terms of Service, currently available at
<a href="/about/terms">www.GOODMagazine.com/about/terms</a>, you must be 18 years of age or older to use
our website. Therefore, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
information about children. If you believe that we have information from or
about anyone under 13 years of age, please notify us by email at
<a href="mailto:webeditor@GOODMagazine.com">webeditor@GOODMagazine.com</a> or write to our Web Director at the address noted above.</p>

<p>Social Security Number.  We do not ask for or require your social security
number to use any of our services or to access any part of our site.</p>

<p>3.	Information We Track.</p>

<p>Log Files.  Similar to many websites, we gather certain anonymous, non-personal
information automatically and store it in web server log files. This information
includes internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider
(ISP), site entry/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream
data. We use this information to improve our site, analyze trends, administer
the site, track users' movements around the site, and gather aggregate
information about our user base as a whole. Aggregate information is data we
collect about a group or category of services or members from which individual
member identities have been removed, and therefore does not include your
personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>Cookies.  A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for
record-keeping purposes. It can also help us understand how our site visitors
click to our site, and what pages they view during their visit. Similar to many
websites, we store an encrypted cookie on your computer so we can remember you
when you come back to our website without requiring you to log-in every time.
Cookies also allow us to track and understand the interests of our users to
enhance the overall experience on our site. </p>

<p>You can set your web browser software to disable cookies. To do so, please refer
to the help section of your specific browser for more information on how to
manage or disable cookies. If you disable cookies, you may still view our site,
but some areas of our site will not work properly.</p>

<p>Some of our business partners, such as advertisers, may also use cookies on our
site. We have no access to or control over these cookies, and, as noted above,
this privacy policy does not govern the use of cookies by our business partners
or advertisers.</p>

<p>HOW INFORMATION IS USED</p>

<p>1.	In Company Communications.</p>

<p>We use emails and/or prominent notifications on our website as our primary means
to inform our members of important service and promotional announcements.</p>

<p>System-related Announcements.  We use your email address to deliver important
system-related announcements. Example system-related announcements include:
email verification during registration, requests for password reset, important
security or server maintenance updates, or policy changes. These service-related
announcements are considered a fundamental part of our service, and members
cannot opt-out of these email announcements.</p>

<p>Promotional Announcements.  In order to improve the experience for our members,
we will offer you the ability to sign up for optional email communications, such
as updates from GOOD, periodic (typically monthly) newsletters, or invitations
to subscriber events. These communications are enhancements to our service and
are entirely optional. We will ask for your consent before sending you
promotional communications, and will make it easy for you to unsubscribe from
these communications, either through the emails or though your member profile.</p>

<p>Send-To-A-Friend Tool.  If you choose to use our "send-to-a-friend" service to
tell a friend about a particular article or information on our site, we will ask
you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your
friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. This information
is used only for sending this one-time email and we do not store this information.</p>

<p>2.	On Our Website.</p>

<p>Identification Of Authors By Username.  The GOODMagazine.com website offers
opportunities for members to vote and comment on content found in GOOD Magazine
and on this website, engage in dialogue, share information, and submit original
content on a blog. This means that to some extent we depend on the contributions
and actions of our members to improve the quality of the site experience. When
you make a contribution to the site (such as adding a photo or posting a blog
entry), you will be identified by your username as the author of that
contribution. In these circumstances, we will only identify you by your
username. Other than the username which can be entirely made up, in using our
service, you are not required to provide or publicize any personally
identifiable information in connection with your contributions and actions on
our website.</p>

<p>Public Profile.  When you register, we will create a public member profile based
on your username. You have the option to include personally identifiable
information in your public profile, but you are not required to do so. You can
easily add, edit, and delete information in your public member profile from the
profile page.</p>

<p>Site Statistics.  As noted above, we may use information collected from our web
log files to calculate and publish anonymous, non-personal, aggregate statistics
that we believe our members are interested in viewing. For example, we may track
and publish the total number of users who have viewed a particular web page. We
publish this data in aggregate form only, and do not tie it to any personally
identifiable information.</p>

<p>3.	For Internal Reporting And Analysis.</p>

<p>As noted above, we use information gathered from log files and cookies to
improve our site, analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements
around the site, and to gather aggregate information about our user base as a
whole. We do not tie this data to personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>HOW INFORMATION IS SHARED AND DISCLOSED</p>

<p>1.	On Our Website.</p>

<p>Public Messages.  Some of our features allow you to communicate with other
members by posting public messages (such as when you make comments on a blog
post, create our own blog post, or respond to comments about an article). Please
be aware that what you write in these public messages can be viewed, collected
or used by anyone who visits our website. We are not responsible for any
personally identifiable information that you submit or permit others to submit
through public messages.</p>

<p>2.	With Third-Parties.</p>

<p>Sharing, Renting, And Selling Information We Collect.  Occasionally we share
anonymous, non-personal, aggregate information about our user base with partners
or advertisers, and we may publish these aggregate usage statistics on our
website for the interest of our members. We do not tie this shared or published
data to personally identifiable information. Additionally, we may make our
subscriber list available to reputable organizations that offer products and
services we believe would interest our members. If you do not want to receive
these offers, please advise us by email at <a href="mailto:webeditor@GOODMagazine.com">webeditor@GOODMagazine.com</a>.</p>

<p>Linked Services.  In some cases, we allow you to access or link to other web
services through our website. For example, we allow members to import photos
from a gallery hosted on a partner's site. We make it easy for you to determine
when you are accessing or linking to these other web services through or
website. In all of these cases, our partners may choose to collect your personal
information as they deem appropriate. As noted above, we are not responsible for
or in control of how our partners collect, use, or disclose your information
obtained through these linked services. We encourage you to be aware when you
are using these partner services and, for your best on-line experience, we
encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal
information to them.</p>

<p>3.	As Necessary In Certain Legal Circumstances.</p>

<p>Legal Requirements.  We reserve the right to disclose your personally
identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure
is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding,
court order, or legal process served on our website.</p>

<p>Acquisition Or Other Transfer.  If our company is acquired, all of our assets,
including member information, may be transferred to the acquiring company. At
that time, your member information, including personally identifiable
information, may become subject to the acquiring company's privacy policy. In
addition, in the event that we must liquidate our assets due to bankruptcy or
other event, we will consider our subscriber and membership information,
including personally identifiable information, as a unique asset subject to sale
or other transfer. Before we transfer your information under any of these
scenarios, we will notify you either by email or by posting a notice on our
site, and we will remind you of your ability to add, edit or delete your
personally identifiable information from your member profile in advance of any
such transfer.</p>

<p>HOW INFORMATION IS KEPT SECURE</p>

<p>Security of Account Information.  Your member account information is
password-protected. We will not share your password with anyone. Please do not
share your password with anyone, and remember to change your password from time
to time, to keep your account information secure.</p>

<p>Network Security.  We have implemented a variety of commercially standard
encryption and security technologies and procedures to protect information,
including your personal information, stored in our computer systems from
unauthorized access. Please be aware that no method of transmission over the
internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, thus we strive to use
commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, but we
cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p>Management Procedures.  We also maintain standard physical and electronic
procedural safeguards that limit access to your personally identifiable
information to our employees (or people working on our behalf and under
confidentiality agreements) who, through the course of standard business
activities, need to access your personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>YOUR PERSONAL CHOICES</p>

<p>Sharing Information With Other Members.  You are able to control what personal
information about you is shared with other members in your public member
profile, and what information you choose to keep private. You can view, add,
edit, and delete information in your public member profile by visiting the
profile page.</p>

<p>Receiving Communications.  If you subscribe to any optional promotional
communications, you will be able to unsubscribe from them through your member
profile or through the emails we send you.</p>

<p>Editing, Updating, Or Deleting Member Profile Information.  You can view the
personally identifiable information we have collected from you in your member
profile where you can add, edit, or delete it as you see fit. You may also
request deletion of your member account through your member profile.</p>

<p>FOR OUR CANADIAN MEMBERS AND VISITORS.  </p>

<p>Canadian citizens, except under circumstances defined by law, are entitled to
access their own personally identifiable information collected by GOOD by
writing to: Web Director, GOOD Magazine LLC, 9155 West Sunset Blvd., West
Hollywood, California 90069. We may ask you to pay an administrative fee for
accessing or copying your information, but will inform you of the anticipated
charges and confirm that you want us to proceed before processing your request.
If you believe that the personally identifiable information about you that we
have collected is incomplete or inaccurate, we will correct the information upon
verification of the omission or error and of the identity of the person
requesting the change. If you wish additional information about our personal
identifiable management, to access, correct or have us investigate any matters
in relation to your personally identifiable information, please contact our Web
Director at the address provided above.</p>

<p>UPDATES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</p>

<p>Our service is evolving and developing. From time to time, we will review and
make changes to our privacy policy. When we do so, we will notify you either by
email or place a prominent notice on our website. The most recent version of our
privacy policy is always available from a link on our homepage, and at
<a href="/about/privacy">www.GOODMagazine.com/about/privacy</a>. We encourage you to visit this site
frequently to stay up to date on our current policy.</p>
