**PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE GOODLIFE.COM.NG, WEBSITE (the "Site").**

**OUR PRIVACY POLICY**

We are committed to protecting our users privacy. To that end, we offer this statement to inform our users of how we define, gather and utilize personal information. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter this policy at any time. Such changes and/or modifications shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, we may occasionally notify you by email about changes to the Site or provide notices of changes by displaying notices or links to notices to you generally on the Site. Please review this policy periodically. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes and/or modifications will constitute your acceptance of the revised privacy policy. 

We define personal information as information that includes a person's full name, address, telephone number, date of birth and/or email address or any other information that is tied to individually identifiable information that would allow someone to identify or contact you, unless stated otherwise herein or on the Site. We can gather information on our users in two different ways: (1) cookie technology and (2) voluntary submissions. 

We utilize cookie technology to collect data regarding the number of visits a person has made to our site. This data is stored in aggregate form and is in no way singled out in an individual file. This information allows us to know what pages/sites are of interest to our users and what pages/sites may be of less interest. Such information is utilized in revising the website to better meet our users needs and interests. 

We also collect personally identifiable information from users through voluntary submissions.

When sweepstakes or contests are open to users 13-17 years old, we will collect only first and last names, phone numbers and email addresses for prize fulfilment purposes only, unless otherwise stated on the Site. 

If a sweepstakes or contest winner is under 18 years old, we will require a consent form signed by the winner's parent or guardian in order to award the prize. We have taken steps to ensure that personally identifiable information collected is secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to its database servers, as well as electronic security systems and password protections, which guard against unauthorized access.
