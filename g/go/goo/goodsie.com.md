### Information We Collect from Your Use of the Services

We collect information about how you use our Services, including your access times, browser types and language, and Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses. We use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to your computer. Cookies are small data files that are stored on your hard drive or in device memory by a website. Among other things, cookies support the integrity of our registration process, retain your preferences and account settings, and help evaluate and compile aggregated statistics about user activity. We may also collect information using web beacons. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails. We may use web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.
