# Good-Tutorials · Privacy

#### Your privacy

The bottom line: your information is safe at Good-Tutorials. I personally value privacy online, and I've built Good-Tutorials accordingly. To put it succinctly, information gathered by your visit is kept private and not sold off to make a quick buck, and information you submit on this site is kept similarly confidential. For more information on specific aspects of your privacy on this site, read on.

#### Information gathered during a visit

A certain amount of information is usually passed from your browser to a server every time you visit a page on any website. This includes information like your IP address, what browser you use, what operating system you run, screen resolution, and so on. This information is retained solely for internal use; I use it to learn more about the demographics of visitors to this site. It is used in an aggregate way; individual visitors are not scrutinized, but the information instead would be compiled and studied as a group. This information collected is not sold to other companies; as mentioned before, it is only for aggregate, demographic use.

#### Information you provide

Some parts of the site solicit information from you. For example, you might give your name and email address when signing up for an account or when posting on the blog. Information like this is voluntary. Some of this information is made available to the public- usernames, website URLs, and real names submitted when you register can be seen on your public profile page. However, personal details like your email address are kept private (more on your email address later). 

#### Cookies

Cookies are used on Good-Tutorials primarily to identify registered users and to log them in on the site automatically. In addition, third-party advertising networks might use their own cookies. Their privacy policies are listed below.

#### Email addresses

Email addresses are one of the most important pieces of information collected on Good-Tutorials. Again, it is voluntary to submit your email address to this site. However, user accounts without a valid email address won't be able to utilize certain functions like the password reset feature. Any email address submitted is kept private; it will not be listed publicly without your consent, and it will not be sold. By submitting your email address, you agree to receive email from Good-Tutorials administrators about updates to this policy, individual correspondence about your user account, or other announcements. They should be few and far between, however. By giving your email address you will not be spammed.

#### Data Security

Great strides are taken to ensure the security of your data. There are procedures in place to safeguard any personal information gathered. 

#### Third Parties

Good-Tutorials does deal with other third party companies, mostly advertising companies. I have to deal with them on a regular basis, so I don't deal with shady companies. The advertising networks Good-Tutorials is associated with are some of the most reputable in the business. For more information, I implore you to review their privacy statements yourself.
