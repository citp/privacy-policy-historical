                  <p>IDT is committed to protecting your privacy and developing 
                    technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online 
                    experience. This IDT Privacy Policy applies to IDT's family 
                    of Web sites and governs data collection and usage at all 
                    IDT sites and services. Please read the complete IDT Privacy 
                    Policy below.</p>
                  <p>The purpose of the IDT Web sites' privacy policy is to inform 
                    you, as a welcome visitor to our Web sites, about the kinds 
                    of information we may gather about you when you visit our 
                    Web sites, how we may use that information, whether we disclose 
                    it to anyone, and your ability to correct, the information. 
                    Finally, please note that this policy applies only to IDT 
                    Web sites and Web sites that carry the IDT Web sites' brand, 
                    and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites to 
                    which we link. We have clearly marked IDT Web sites and these 
                    branded Web sites with our logo so you know where this policy 
                    applies.</p>
                  <p><b class="bluetext">Information About All IDT Web sites' Visitors</b></p>
                  <p>IDT keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers 
                    visit within the Web sites, in order to determine what sites 
                    and services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver 
                    customized content and advertising within IDT to customers 
                    whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular 
                    subject area. Our service automatically gathers certain usage 
                    information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to 
                    IDT Web sites and its areas,. This is similar to the way television 
                    ratings tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. 
                    We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective data 
                    helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the 
                    site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing 
                    as we can make it for as many of you as possible. </p>
                  <p>For example, IDT Web sites may use a technology nicknamed 
                    "cookies" that tells us how and when pages in our 
                    site are visited, and by how many people. IDT cookies do not 
                    collect personally identifiable information and we do not 
                    combine information collected through cookies with other personally 
                    identifiable information to tell us who you are or even what 
                    your screen name or e-mail address is. We also may provide 
                    statistical "ratings" information, never information 
                    about you personally, to our IDT Web sites partners about 
                    how our members, collectively, use IDT Web sites. We do this 
                    so they too can understand how much people use their areas 
                    and our site in order for them to provide you with the best 
                    possible Web experience as well. </p>
                  <p><b class="bluetext">Use of Cookies</b></p>
                  <p>Some IDT Web sites may use "cookies" to help you 
                    personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file 
                    that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies 
                    cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your 
                    computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only 
                    be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie 
                    to you.</p>
                  <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience 
                    feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell 
                    the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. 
                    For example, if you personalize IDT's pages, or register with 
                    IDT sites or services, a cookie helps IDT to recall your specific 
                    information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process 
                    of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, 
                    shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same 
                    IDT Web site, the information you previously provided can 
                    be retrieved, so you can easily use the IDT features that 
                    you customized.</p>
                  <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web 
                    browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually 
                    modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. 
                    If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully 
                    experience the interactive features of the IDT services or 
                    Web sites you visit.</p>
                  <p><b class="bluetext">Use of Third Party Advertising</b></p>
                  <p>The majority of the advertisements you see on IDT Web sites 
                    are displayed by IDT. In addition, IDT also allows other companies, 
                    called third-party advertisers, to display advertisements 
                    while you are viewing content on IDT Web sites. These advertisement 
                    are selected based on what we believe will be of most interest 
                    to you.</p>
                  <p><b class="bluetext">Information About You </b></p>
                  <p>Sometimes, we may specifically ask for information about 
                    you when you sign up to use a service or when you order a 
                    product. IDT does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists 
                    to third parties. We do, however, need certain information 
                    -- such as name, age, Internet address or screen name, billing 
                    address, type of computer, credit card number -- in order 
                    to provide that service or product to you. We may also use 
                    that information to let you know of additional products and 
                    services about which you might be interested. You can choose 
                    not to receive such information if you don't want to by letting 
                    us know on the registration screen when you sign up for the 
                    product or service. We may ask you for information about your 
                    interests so that both you and we can take advantage of the 
                    interactivity of the online medium, but you may always choose 
                    to respond or not. Additionally, we may provide you with an 
                    opportunity to be listed in a directory on one of our IDT- 
                    branded services -- these listings are also optional and you 
                    can make changes to or eliminate this information when you 
                    want to. </p>
                  <p>IDT does not associate sensitive data, such as your race, 
                    religion, or political affiliations, with personally identifiable 
                    information. IDT takes precautions to segregate any sensitive 
                    data you may provide on IDT sites and services that reference 
                    your race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity or political 
                    affiliations.</p>
                  <p><b class="bluetext">Security of your Personal Information</b></p>
                  <p>IDT secures your personal information from unauthorized access, 
                    use or disclosure. IDT secures the personally identifiable 
                    information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, 
                    secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use 
                    or disclosure. Personal information (such as a credit card 
                    number) is transmitted to other Web sites through the use 
                    of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted protection.</p>
                  <p><b class="bluetext">Third Party Disclosure</b> </p>
                  <p>We do not use or disclose information about your individual 
                    visits to IDT Web sites or information that you may give us, 
                    such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, 
                    to any outside companies. However, we may share with our Web 
                    site partners aggregated statistical "ratings" information 
                    about the use of IDT Web sites. IDT may share data with trusted 
                    partners to help us perform statistical analysis. All such 
                    third parties are prohibited from using your personal information 
                    except to provide these services to IDT, and they are required 
                    to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p>
                  <p>IDT Web sites will never disclose your personal information 
                    without notice unless it is required to do so by law or in 
                    the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:<br>
                    (a) conform to the law or comply with legal process served 
                    on IDT or the site;<br>
                    (b) protect and defend the rights or property of IDT, an IDT 
                    Web site; and,<br>
                    (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal 
                    safety of users of IDT, its Web sites, or the public.</p>
                  <p><b class="bluetext">Children On The Web </b></p>
                  <p>IDT Corporation, Inc. takes special care to protect the safety 
                    and privacy of children using our services. We do not specifically 
                    collect information about children and believe that children 
                    should get their parents' consent before giving out any personal 
                    information. We encourage you to participate in your child's 
                    experience in cyberspace and to review our important safety 
                    tips before your child explores the Internet. We also encourage 
                    you and your child to visit IDT Web sites that provides access 
                    to age-appropriate content available on the Web. IDT also 
                    recommends that parents use Web filtering technology to supervise 
                    their kids' access to the Web. </p>
                  <p><b class="bluetext">IDT Web sites Privacy Policy Changes</b></p>
                  <p>IDT will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect 
                    company and customer feedback. When IDT posts changes to this 
                    Statement, you will see the word "updated" next 
                    to the Privacy Statement link on the front page of IDT. If 
                    there are material changes to this Statement or in how IDT 
                    will use your personally identifiable information, IDT will 
                    prominently post such changes prior to implementing the change. 
                    IDT encourages you to periodically review this Statement to 
                    be informed of how IDT is protecting your information.</p>

                  <p><b class="bluetext">Enforcement</b></p>
                  <p>By upholding our commitment to protecting the privacy of 
                    your personal information, IDT has agreed to disclose its
