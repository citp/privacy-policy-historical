<p><em>Personal Information</em></p>
<p>You can visit a GoodData Site without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need certain personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) from you.</p>
<p>You may choose to provide us with Personal Information (such as your name, email address and company name) through the GoodData Site when you elect to register with GoodData in order to download our products or access premium content. When you provide Personal Information in order to register with GoodData, such Personal Information will be used in order to provide you with access to the requested products, services content and/or information. We may also use the Personal Information to help us understand who is using our products and services and to help us manage business development activities.  If you tell us that you do not want us to use this Personal Information as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletters</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.  Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe.  Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Information</em></p>
<p>In addition, we sometimes collect anonymous information from visits to the GoodData Site to help us provide better customer service and to make the GoodData Site as user friendly as possible. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit and we also measure visitor activity on GoodData Site. However, when we do so, we do so in ways that keep the information anonymous. GoodData may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service. None of the information described in this paragraph is reviewed at an individual level.

<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.</p>

Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><em>Links to Other Web Sites</em></p>
<p>The GoodData Site may contain links to other Web sites. GoodData is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. The links from a GoodData Site do not imply that GoodData endorses or has reviewed the third party Web sites. We suggest contacting the operators of those Web sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</p>
<p><strong>Project Invitations</strong></p>
<p>If you choose to invite others to a report or project within your organization, we will ask you for the other user’s name and email address.

<p><em>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Information and Other Information:</em></p>

<p>We may also share your Personal Information with our subsidiaries, affiliates and other related companies for purposes consistent with this Policy, including sending emails and credit card processing.</p>
<p><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong></p>
<p>GoodData, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>GoodData may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of GoodData, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of a GoodData Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p>

If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>
