# Privacy Policy

### WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS

GoodSearch (including the GoodSearch Search Engine, GoodShop Mall, and GoodDining ), takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. This policy covers how GoodSearch treats personal information that GoodSearch collects and receives, including information related to your past use of GoodSearch products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable, like your name, address, photo, or email address, and that is not otherwise publicly available. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing your personal information with us. 

### INFORMATION COLLECTION

#### General

GoodSearch collects limited non-personally identifying information and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, the date and time of your query, GoodSearch cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services. 

#### Personal Information

The GoodSearch Search Engine and GoodShop Mall do not require any personally identifiable information. 

However, if you opt to register and set up a personal account on GoodSearch, you will be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information. Your personally identifiable information is used to set up your GoodSearch account and to create your profile. Information on your profile is limited to your name, the organizations and causes you support, your actions, your amount raised and your list of friends; it does not include any other personally identifiable information such as your email or home address. By default, access to your profile is made public. You may choose to limit access to your profile to only your friends. You can also make your support of any organization completely anonymous. To edit your privacy settings, click on the "Account Settings" on the left of your profile page and select the "Privacy" link at the top of the subsequent page. 

Even if you do not create a GoodSearch account, some of our services, including registering your nonprofit with GoodSearch and signing a petition on GoodPetitions may require you to provide personally indentifying information (typically your name, e-mail address, and mailing address). Likewise, if you use our GoodDining service, membership requires that you provide a valid email address. 

### INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

GoodSearch does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

  * You have registered for GoodDining, in which case you may receive administrative promotional emails as well as customer service from our GoodDining partner, Rewards Network. 
  * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with GoodSearch under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help GoodSearch communicate with you about offers from GoodSearch and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of GoodSearch's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 
  * We transfer information about you if GoodSearch is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, GoodSearch will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 



GoodSearch displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. 

  * GoodSearch does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. 
  * GoodSearch advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies). 



GoodSearch works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business. 

### COOKIES

GoodSearch may set and access GoodSearch cookies on your computer. 

GoodSearch lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to GoodSearch's cookies. 

### MISCELLANEOUS

You can edit or delete your nonprofit's account information and your email preferences, at any time. 

New categories of marketing communications might be added from time to time. Users can opt out of receiving future marketing communications from these new categories or they can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages they receive. 

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the GoodSearch service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the GoodSearch Newsletter, that are considered part of your GoodSearch account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. 

### CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY

We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. 

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you. 

### PUBLIC INFORMATION

Our website contains links to other websites, including without limitation, the website of Rewards Network, our partner in the GoodDining program; you should carefully review the privacy policy posted by Rewards Network before you register for the GoodDining service. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. We also make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available to you. Please understand that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. We have no control over its use and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

### CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

GoodSearch may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a prominent notice on our site.
