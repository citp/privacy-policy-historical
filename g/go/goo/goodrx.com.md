# Privacy Policy - GoodRx

At **GoodRx,** we respect your right to privacy and we understand that visitors to **www.goodrx.com (“ _Site_ ”)** need to control the uses of their personal information. The privacy policy below describes the measures taken by us to protect your privacy in connection with your use of our Site. 

**WHAT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT, AND WHEN DO WE COLLECT IT?**

  * **Information You Provide.**  
GoodRx does not collect any personal information from those who visit the Site unless a visitor registers to receive certain services, such as price alerts, coupons and discount cards. In order to receive price alerts on a set of prescription drugs or to ask us to send you a coupon, you must give us your email address. If you click a button requesting that we send you the coupon by text message, you must also give us your phone number. If you tell us which Medicare plan you are on, we collect that information as well. If you request a discount card, you must give us your name and mailing address. 

  * **Communications With Us.**  
When you contact us by email or other communications, we may retain that information in order to respond to your request and improve our services. 

  * **Log Information.**  
When you access GoodRx Services, our servers automatically record certain information. These logs include information such as the date and time you access our site, the browser you are using, and other common browser information. We will use this log information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Site. Your log information also may be used to gather broad demographic information. 

  * **Location Data.**  
When you are using GoodRx with a browser or mobile device, you can enter a location or explicitly allow GoodRx access to your location. GoodRx collects and stores that information. 

  * **Cookies.**  
A “cookie” is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. We use cookies to collect, store and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the services we provide. If you are a registered user, we will use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. We also use cookies that let us know your location, the drug information visited while on our Site and the third party websites you visited before accessing our Site (“referrer information”). If you are a registered user, the foregoing information is associated with your GoodRx account information. We retain the information we receive from the cookies we place on your computer for thirty days. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your personally identifiable information. You should know that if you visit other websites, you may be required to accept third party cookies. We do not control use of any cookies that are deposited on your computer when you visit third party websites; and we expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them. 

We use remarketing with Google and other remarketing providers to advertise online. We may place cookies on your computer or other devices to assist Google and other third parties to feed advertisements to you based on your past visits to GoodRx and other websites; and we may also allow other third parties, including Google, to do so as well. However, we never provide advertisers or any other third parties any information that reveals a personal health condition or personal health information. 

  * **Demographics and Interest Information.**  
The GoodRx website has implemented Google Analytics Demographics and Interest reporting. This tool enables us to view demographic and other information aggregated from the overall population of the visitors to our site. This does not include any personally identifiable information. 

  * **Information Received From Pharmacy Benefit Managers.**  
Most prescriptions purchased in the Unites States, including prescriptions filled through the use of discount coupons, loyalty cards or insurance co-pays, result in the pharmacy reporting patient data back to the company that provides the benefit. When you use a coupon provided by GoodRx, we sometimes receive personally identifying information about you and other transaction information from the corresponding Pharmacy Benefit Manager. This information may include prescription information such as your name, date of birth, your location, the name of your physician and when and where you filled the prescription. 




**HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?**

  * **Price Alerts, Coupons, Discount Cards.**  
We use your email address only to send you price alerts or to send you coupons by email. We use your phone number only to send you coupons by text message if you request that service. We use your mailing address only for mailing you discount cards if you request them. 

  * **Tracking Information.**  
We use location information, the drug information you view while on our Site, the referrer information and, if you are a registered user of the Site, your account information in order to provide you with better, faster service, particularly for recurring visits. We also use referrer information to generate group numbers on coupons for tracking. 

  * **Information Received From Pharmacy Benefit Managers.**  
We de-identify information we receive from Pharmacy Benefit Managers, in order to remove personally identifiable information including your name and date of birth. We may retain the non-personally identifiable transaction information we receive for analysis. 




**WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH?**

We will only share your name and address with others if you request a discount card to be mailed to the address you provided; and that information will only be shared with the third parties we use to fulfill discount card requests. GoodRx ensures that those third parties are either bound to comply with our privacy policy or have similar privacy policies that protect your information; and we require that they destroy your personal information after your card request is fulfilled.  
However, we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on us; (2) protect and defend our rights or property; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety.  
We may request and gather other information from you (for example, your Medicare plan) from time to time. We will not share any personal information with any third party in a manner that identifies you as an individual, unless you request a discount card and then only the information described above.  
When we share demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only.  
As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets, and, depending upon the transaction, your personally identifiable information may be one of the transferred assets. In the event that we are acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party. 

**HOW LONG DO WE RETAIN THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU?**

We will retain the information we collect from you in our system indefinitely. If you would like information deleted, you may request deletion by emailing us at info@goodrx.com. 

**WHAT ARE YOUR OPTIONS TO CONTROL THE USE OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?**

The personally identifiable information we collect from you is displayed on the My Prescriptions page of our Site. If any of that information is in error, you may request corrections by sending them to info@goodrx.com. You may also delete your account by going to Settings on the My Prescriptions page. 

**WHAT ABOUT KIDS’ PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?**

Our Site is not directed to children under the age of 13. We assume our website is used by adults or minors supervised by a parent are guardian. We respect the privacy of parents and children and are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). On those areas of our Site that ask for age, we do not collect personal information from individuals who identify themselves as under the age of 13 except in those limited circumstances where we believe that such collection is permitted under COPPA.  
We may ask prospective users to provide their age during the registration process and on other areas of our Site. If a user indicates that he or she is under the age of 13 then all personal data collected during the registration process is automatically deleted except that we may retain and use limited information, such as the child's email address, for a limited period of time, in those cases where we believe that the collection and use of such information is permitted under COPPA. 

If a parent believes that his or her child has provided us with personal information, he or she can contact us via email or postal mail as listed below. We will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13. 

We believe that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission.
