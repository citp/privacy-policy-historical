      <p>Your
privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this
notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make
about the way your information is collected and used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>No Spyware / No Adware</h2>
      <p>All our software products are free from spyware or adware of any kind.
      Our products will never install any tracking software on your system, or collect personal information about you and your browsing habits.
      Our software does not "spy" on other programs you run or web sites you visit.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The
Information We Collect (through standard web log files)</h2>
<p>You can visit the websites of Softnik Technologies (Softnik) without
revealing any information about yourself. Softnik does collect information
regarding visitors to our Web site, such as IP Address, number of visits, and
average time spent through the standard web log files. We analyze this data for
trends and statistics to help us improve the content of our site.</p>
<p>We have a
number of free software that you may download from our site. Many of these
software require no registration. This means that we will not even ask for your
email address. You can simply download and use the software with out revealing
any thing about yourself. These software will have a 'No registration' message
displayed very near to the download link.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Personal
Information</h2>
<p>There are times, however, when we may request information from you, such as
your, name, address and e-mail address. When additional information is
requested, we will try to let you know at the time of collection how we intend
to use the personal information you provide, such as respond to your inquiry,
participate in certain promotions, conduct a survey or allow you to access
specific information. If you sign up for an Softnik electronic newsletter or
e-mail list, each message will include instructions on how to
"unsubscribe" from that list. We respect your right to choose whether
to give us personal information or "opt out" if you do not wish to
disclose personal information. We do our best to maintain the accuracy of any
personal information you do supply to us.</p>
<p>Any
information provided by you will be used for Softnik's purposes only. Your
information will not be shared with individual or other companies [such as
direct mail organizations or other third parties] unless required by law.
However, Softnik may need to provide your name and delivery address to third
parties that Softnik uses for delivering specific services to you (such as
support services or shipping purposes when you ask us to send something to you).</p>
<p>Our Web
sites may provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control those Web
sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third party
sites.</p>
<h2>Security
and Quality</h2>
<p>Softnik is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect the individual
identifying information that you provide. You can help Softnik update and
maintain the accuracy of any personal information you supply by notifying
Softnik of any changes to your address, title, phone number or e-mail address.
In some programs, you may do this online by following the instructions on
membership profile pages. You may also update your information by <a href="/icenter/contact.php">contacting
us</a> with a description or example of what you wish to change.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Softnik some times uses cookies to allow us to provide you with tailored
information from our Web. A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can
send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. You can set your
browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide
whether to accept it. These cookies do not track individual information. Softnik
may also use cookies when you register for one of our products or services. In
this case, a cookie will store useful information that enables our Web site to
remember you when you return to visit, but only Softnik web sites can read that
information. While using our websites, you may receive cookies from our
advertisers or sponsors. Softnik does not control such cookies.</p>
<h2>Oversight
or Questions</h2>
<p>Softnik welcomes comments and questions on this policy. As stated above, we are
dedicated to protecting your privacy and will make every reasonable effort to
keep your information secure. Due to the rapidly evolving changes on the
Internet, we may update this policy. All revisions will be posted to this site.
