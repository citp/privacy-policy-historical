We will attempt to ensure that these entities do not use your personal information for any other purpose, and that they have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us.

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you if you are violating the Terms of Service or Use Agreements, or may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with GO! Overseas rights or property, other users of the GO! Overseas site, or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities.

As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of GO! Overseas and will become part of our normal business records. As such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible. Similarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to GO! Overseas successor or assign.

GO! Overseas may also have message boards and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When posting to a message board or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available on-line and the user does so at his or her own risk.

### What choices do I have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of my personal information?

GO! Overseas allows you to control the way that we use personal identifying information that we might obtain. At the time you provide personal information, GO! Overseas may give you the option of declining any future offers or information about new products, promotions, or services. In addition, many of the "mailings" GO! Overseas may send you, such as newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the receipt of any future mailings.

### What are cookies and how do you use them?

Cookies are a feature of your Web browser that allows Web sites to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie stored on your computer can be used to "remember" things like your password, or that you have already registered. This allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration. In addition, GO! Overseas may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional, marketing, or security purposes.

### What are Internet protocol addresses?

As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. When credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry standard, SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption.
