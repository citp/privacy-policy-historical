### What types of information do we collect?

At Go Overseas, we collect information which on its own, or in combination with other information, may be used to identify you as an individual (“Personal Data”) and information that cannot be used individually to identify you but must be combined with other information to identify you personally (“Non-Personal Data”). 

Here is a breakdown of the ways we collect Personal Data and Non-Personal Data and how it is stored: 

  * **As a Go Overseas user,** you can register for an account in a variety of ways, including by signing up for an account, leaving a review, participating for a scholarship or contest, booking a program directly on Go Overseas or through one of our Partners (as defined below), asking a question or providing an answer, or adding a program to your wish list. In all of these cases, your information is stored in our servers up until such point as you request your account to be deleted. We also use services including MailChimp and Mandrill to handle email marketing, and your Personal Data may be stored in these systems as well.
  * **As a Go Overseas partner,** if you reach out to any member of our Partner Growth team (including via the [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) email address), your information will be automatically added to our CRM tool, Hubspot.

Go Overseas may disclose your Personal Data to third party vendors to fulfill product orders or prizes, to process mailings, or to process, analyze, and/or store data. Additionally, we may share your Personal Data with third parties that we believe that you might be interested in.

For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or systems.

We will attempt to ensure that these entities do not use your Personal Data for any other purpose and that they have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us. While their use of your Personal Data is beyond our control, by agreeing to this Policy, you do consent to our Partner’s use of your Personal Data as described above. 

To the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to disclose your Personal Data if we believe that you are violating the Terms of Use, or if we believe that you may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with Go Overseas rights or property, other users of the Go Overseas site, or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities.

Additionally, you agree that we may disclose your information if we reasonably believe that you have violated US laws or the terms of our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy or if we believe that a third party is at risk of bodily harm. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also proactively report you and release your information without receiving any request to third parties where we believe that it is proper to do so for legal reasons, where your actions violate any law of the United States or any other country having jurisdiction over us, our Platform, or our Terms of Use. You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.

At the time you provide personal information, Go Overseas may give you the option of declining any future offers or information about new products, promotions, or services.

### What are cookies and pixels and how do you use them?

Cookies and pixels are features of your Web browser that allows Web sites to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie or pixel stored on your computer can be used to "remember" things like your password, your preferences, or that you have already registered. This allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration.

In addition, Go Overseas may use cookies and/or pixels to retrieve user information for promotional, marketing, or security purposes. If you decide to disable cookies from loading on your Web browser portions of the Platform may not be able to function properly. Please be aware that some cookies loaded onto our Platform may be accessible by third parties.

Here are the ways we use cookies and pixels on Go Overseas:

  * We use the Google Tag Manager to implement both a Google Analytics pixel and a Facebook pixel. Both of these pixels collect anonymized data which allows us to better understand what you love on Go Overseas and help you find more of that information. Additionally, a select group of our partners also access our Facebook pixel data for advertising purposes.
  * We use a tool called Crazy Egg which collects anonymized, Non-Personal data about visitors behavior on Go Overseas. This data is not tied to user accounts in any way but is used as part of our efforts to improve user experience and design across Go Overseas.



### What do I do if I want to correct or delete my personal information?

If you wish to alter any Personal Data you may be able to do so via your account dashboard located on the Go Overseas Platform. If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your Personal Data, or would like to correct or request that we delete such personal information, please contact us by e-mailing us [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

Please note that the deletion of your data may lead to the termination of your account and applicable services.

### How secure is my personal information?

Go Overseas has taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration. As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. When credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry standard, SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of personal information.

Though we attempt to keep your information safe and secure, you must understand that electronic transmission of information over the internet is never 100% secure and thus we cannot guarantee the absolute safety and security of any information provided. We are not responsible to our users or to any third party due to any such loss, misuse, or alteration, except to the extent required by GDPR, the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles (“Privacy Shield”), or other applicable law.
