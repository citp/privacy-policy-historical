# Goedeker's Privacy Policies

We have the utmost respect for our customers’ privacy. We make every effort to ensure your personal information is safe and secure. We understand that you are entrusting us with very sensitive material and we take that trust seriously. Godeker’s has developed this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to protecting your piece-of-mind. This policy describes how we will use and share your personal information. By using the Goedeker’s website, you agree to this policy. 

  * We will NEVER sell your personal information to any third party. This is a promise we make to all of our customers.
  * When making a purchase or registering with Goedeker’s, we collect your billing address and financial information. Your personal information is needed for the completion of your order or purchase. 
  * We collect your name, phone number and email address if you request information about our products, so we can respond to your request.
  * We may email product and promotional information to those who have registered on our site, if we believe it is relevant. You will always have the option of opting out if you do not wish to receive these emails. 
  * We do send emails including: user administrative information, order confirmation, and other order-related information. Since these are not promotional emails, you cannot opt out unless you deactivate your account.



Godeker’s employs the services of a number of third-party service providers. These include, but are not limited to: online shopping carts, online payments, and shipping agents. Third-party service providers DO NOT have permission to use your personal information for any purpose other than the fulfillment of their service. This includes any promotional use. 

We do share your shipping address with shipping agents for the purpose of delivery only.

Godeker’s uses cookies on our website, as do all online retailers and sellers. 

A cookie is a small file left on your computer which tells a website if you have visited before or not. This allows for a web experience tailored to your needs. 

We do allow cookies to track user behavior on our website, but this is never linked to any identifying information. The user behavior information collected is mainly demographic in nature and primarily for our own research purposes as well as improving our services. Again, it is never linked to a specific person’s private information.

We may allow third party cookies to collect user behavior information in some cases. We cannot access or control these cookies. But, as stated above, the information will never identify a specific customer. 

If you have purchased a product from us or have created an account on our website, you may update your personal information or deactivate your account any time you wish. You can have your account deleted by sending an email request. Once we receive the request, we will promptly honor it. 

The security of your personal information is one of our greatest concerns. We encrypt all information entered into the website using secure socket layer technology. While no data transmission or storage technology is beyond failure, we take extreme care in ensuring we are meeting accepted industry standards. 

We cannot guarantee absolute security, but we work every day to make sure we are doing our best to protect your personal information. 

If Goedeker’s is sold, acquired or merged with another company or entity, your personal information is an asset that could be transferred. If this happens, we will notify you in some prominent way at least 30 days in advance. 

It is your information, so you will have a choice whether it is transferred or deleted. 

In the event of illegal activity or other circumstances, we could be legally obligated to share your personal information with the government, law enforcement or some other third party. We always have the right to share personal information in response to a formal request from law enforcement or the court. 

If Goedeker’s changes or alters this privacy policy, we will inform you in a prominent and reasonable way. We will make every effort to ensure you understand how your personal information is being collected and used. 

It is always our intention to be clear and honest.
