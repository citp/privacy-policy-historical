eShow complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  eShow has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view eShow’s certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

#### SAFE HARBOR

The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles (the "U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Principles") and frequently asked questions (collectively the “U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework”) to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EU to the United States. The EEA also has recognized the U.S. Safe Harbor as providing adequate data protection. The United States Department of Commerce and the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland have agreed on a similar set of data protection principles (the "U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles") and frequently asked questions (collectively the “U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework) to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under Swiss law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from Switzerland to the United States. Consistent with its commitment to protect personal privacy, eShow adheres to the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles (hereinafter “Safe Harbor Principles”).

#### SCOPE

This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (the "Policy") applies to all personal information received from consumers by eShow in the United States from the European Economic Area and from Switzerland, in any format including electronic, paper or verbal.  
 

#### DEFINITIONS

For purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:

"Agent" means any third party that collects or uses personal information under the instructions of, and solely for, eShow or to which eShow discloses personal information for use on eShow's behalf.

"eShow" means Netronix Corp, its successors, subsidiaries, divisions and groups in the United States.

"Personal information" means any information or set of information that identifies or is used by or on behalf of eShow to identify an individual. Personal information does not include information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public personal information.

"Sensitive personal information" means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or that concerns health or sex life. In addition, eShow will treat as sensitive personal information any information received from a third party where that third party treats and identifies the information as sensitive.

#### PRIVACY PRINCIPLES

The privacy principles in this Policy are based on the Safe Harbor Principles.

**NOTICE:**  Where eShow collects personal information directly from individuals in the EEA, it will inform them about the purposes for which it collects and uses personal information about them and the choices and means, if any, eShow offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide personal information to eShow, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before eShow uses or discloses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected or discloses information to a non-agent third party.

Where eShow receives personal information from its subsidiaries, affiliates or other entities in the EEA, it will use and disclose such information in accordance with the notices provided by such entities and the choices made by the individuals to whom such personal information relates.

**CHOICE:**  For personal information, eShow will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-in) whether their personal information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

For sensitive personal information, eShow will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

eShow will provide individuals with reasonable mechanisms to exercise their choices.

**DATA INTEGRITY:**  eShow will use personal information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. eShow will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. We will only collect and store personal information that is relevant to fulfill the purpose of the request and will retain such information no longer than appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the request.

**TRANSFERS TO AGENTS:**  eShow will obtain assurances from its agents that they will safeguard personal information consistently with this Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided by agents include: a contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles, being subject to EU Directive 95/46/EC (the EU Data Protection Directive), Safe Harbor certification by the agent, or being subject to another European Commission adequacy finding (e.g., companies located in Canada). Where eShow has knowledge that an agent is using or disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to this Policy, eShow will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure.

**ACCESS AND CORRECTION:**  Upon request, eShow will grant individuals reasonable access to personal information that it holds about them. In addition, eShow will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. These requests can be made by completing our International Consumer Service form at <http://www.goeshow.com/contactus.cfm> or by calling the eShow office in the country where they reside and asking for consumer services.

**SECURITY:**  eShow will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

**ENFORCEMENT:**  eShow will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Policy. Any employee that eShow determines intentionally violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

**DISPUTE RESOLUTION:**  Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of personal information should be directed to the eShow, Office of the President at the address given below. eShow will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this Policy. For complaints that cannot be resolved between eShow and the complainant, eShow has agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures of USCIB pursuant to the Safe Harbor Principles.

**LIMITATIONS ON APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES**  
Adherence by eShow to these Safe Harbor Principles may be limited (a) to the extent required or permitted by law or legal process, such as to respond to or investigate a legal or ethical obligation or request or pursuant to court orders, subpoenas, interrogatories or similar directive carrying the force of law; and (b) to the extent expressly permitted by an applicable law, rule or regulation.

**INTERNET PRIVACY**  
eShow sees the Internet and the use of other technologies as valuable tools for communicating and interacting with consumers. eShow recognizes the importance of maintaining the privacy of information collected online and will adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles as it pertains to governing the treatment of personal information collected through web sites that it operates. With respect to personal information that is transferred from the European Economic Area or Switzerland to the U.S. eShow’s Internet Privacy Policy is represented by the Safe Harbor Principles and the Safe Harbor Privacy Policy that can be found at <http://www.goeshow.com/privacy.cfm>.
