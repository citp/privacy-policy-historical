## PRIVACY SHIELD OVERVIEW

The EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks were designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the European Commission and Swiss Administration, respectively, to provide companies on both sides of the Atlantic with a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States in support of transatlantic commerce. On July 12, 2016, the European Commission deemed the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework adequate to enable data transfers under EU law (see the adequacy determination). <http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2461_en.htm>

On January 12, 2017, the Swiss Government announced the approval of the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as a valid legal mechanism to comply with Swiss requirements when transferring personal data from Switzerland to the United States. See the statements from the Swiss Federal Council <https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-65210.html>

and Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner <https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/datenschutz/00626/00753/01405/01406/index.html?lang=en>

Netronix Corporation, DBA eShow complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
