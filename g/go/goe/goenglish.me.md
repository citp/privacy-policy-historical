### Terms of Use and Privacy Notice

**Privacy Statement**

We will collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us.

**Information Collected and Stored Automatically**

If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit:

  * The internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address ( an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website.
  * The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
  * The date and time you access our site;
  * The pages you visit;
  * If you linked to this website from another website, the address of that other website.



**If You Send Us Personal Information**

If you choose to provide us with personal information by sending an e-mail to us, or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it through our website, we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get the information you have requested. We do not collect personal information for any other purposes. Moreover, we do not create individual profiles with the information you provide or give this information to any private organizations. Nor do we collect information for commercial marketing.

We would share your e-mail with another federal government agency only if your inquiry related to that agency or if we were required to do so by law. In addition, we would release documents, including e-mails, if required to do so by a congressional or judicial subpoena.

**Information Collected for Tracking and Customization (Cookies)**

A cookie is a small file that a website transfers to your computer to allow it to remember specific information about your session while you are connected. Your computer will only share the information in the cookie with the website that provided it, and no other website can request it. There are two types of cookies, session and persistent. Session cookies last only as long as your web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for longer periods of time.

Voice of America websites may use session cookies for technical purposes such as to enable better navigation through the site, or to allow you to customize your preferences for interacting with the site. A few VOA websites may also make use of persistent cookies to remember you between visits so, for example, you can save your customized preference settings for future visits. Each VOA site using persistent cookies identifies itself as doing so.

At no time is your private information, whether stored in persistent cookies or elsewhere, shared with third parties who have no right to that information. If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies stored on your machine, you can turn them off in your browser. However, this may affect the functioning of some VOA websites.

**Disclaimer**

We may link to external sites that help us perform our mission or illustrate news reports. Links to external servers do not imply any official Voice of America endorsement of the opinions or ideas expressed therein, nor do such links guarantee the validity of the information provided. Links to commercial sites are in no way an endorsement of any vendor's products or services. Links will be provided to external servers that are managed in a professional manner (i.e., it is fully operational, is available most of the time, does not serve inaccurate information or obscene graphics, etc.). This server will not link to external servers if such a link would appear to provide an official endorsement of fundraising efforts or lobbying for a political agenda.

The Voice of America does not broadcast in the United States. Our programs are intended for overseas audiences, as is our website. Domestic American broadcasters utilizing similar tradenames and call letters are not affiliated with this international broadcasting agency, or with VOANews.com.

**Corrections**

VOANews.com handles errors in the following way: If the error is a simple typo that doesn't change facts or understanding of the story, we consider it a minor change and simply correct it without further mention. If the error is substantive or one of fact, we change it, add an asterisk *, then a note at the bottom saying when it was corrected and what was wrong originally. On a breaking news story, we may overwrite the text of an article several times as the story develops. Due to the urgency of the news and time constraints, we will not mention the exact changes in each version - we expect understanding that it is a story that is still developing.

**Rules for Posting Comments**

All comments will be reviewed before posting. VOA will make every effort to review and post comments within 48 hours, usually less. VOA encourages thoughtful discussion, and will not censor comments based on ideology or political points of view. VOA will not edit comments - we will either post them or not.

All comments must follow these rules:

  1. Stay on topic.
  2. No obscenity, profanity, vulgarity, hate language, SHOUTING, or other bad behavior.
  3. No personal attacks. No inflammatory language or calls for violence.
