On July 12, 2016, the European Commission deemed the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework adequate to enable data transfers under EU law (see the adequacy determination). <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2461_en.htm" target="_blank">http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2461_en.htm</a></p>
