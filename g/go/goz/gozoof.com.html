	<h5>
		What This Privacy Policy Covers</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>This policy covers how Shaycom treats personal information that Shaycom collects
			and receives, including information related to your past use of Shaycom products
			and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable
			like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise
			publicly available. </li>
		<li>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Shaycom does not own
			or control, or to people that Shaycom does not employ or manage. </li>
	</ul>
	<h5>
		Information Collection and Use</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Shaycom collects personal information when you register with Shaycom, when you use
			the Shaycom services, and when you visit Shaycom pages or the pages of certain Shaycom
			partners. Shaycom may combine information about you that we have with information
			we obtain from business partners or other companies. </li>
		<li>When you register we ask for information such as your email address. Once you register
			with Shaycom and sign in to the Shaycom services, you are not anonymous to us. </li>
		<li>Shaycom collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our
			business partners. </li>
		<li>Shaycom automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your
			browser, including your <a href="IpAddresses.aspx">IP address</a>, Shaycom
			<a href="Cookies.aspx">cookie</a> information, and the page you request.
		</li>
		<li>Shaycom uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the content
			you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services,
			contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and
			external clients. </li>
	</ul>
	<h5>
		Information Sharing and Disclosure</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Shaycom does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other
			people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've
			requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
			<ul>
				<li>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Shaycom
					under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information
					to help Shaycom communicate with you about news and information&nbsp;from Shaycom.
					However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
				</li>
				<li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise
					our legal rights or defend against legal claims; </li>
				<li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent,
					or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving
					potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Shaycom's
					terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. </li>
				<li>We transfer information about you if Shaycom is acquired by or merged with another
					company. In this event, Shaycom will notify you before information about you is
					transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>On some of our pages, Shaycom displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers
			(including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view,
			or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24
			from a particular geographic area.
			<ul>
				<li>Shaycom does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact
					with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are
					consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that
					you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. </li>
				<li>Shaycom advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance
					agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as
					stores, airlines, and software companies).</li></ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>

			your computer.</li>
		<li>Shaycom lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and
			access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is
			subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies
			do not have access to Shaycom's cookies. </li>
		<li>Shaycom uses <a href="WebBeacons.aspx">web beacons</a> to access Shaycom cookies
			inside and outside our network of web sites and in connection with Shaycom products
