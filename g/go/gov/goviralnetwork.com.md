## Cookie Policy

A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers downloaded on to your computer when you access certain websites, including those within Be On for Publishers. Cookies allow a website to recognise a user’s preferences as previously chosen by the user when they return to a site. A cookie itself does not contain or collect information. However, when it is read by a server in conjunction with a web browser it can help a website deliver a more user-friendly service. For example, remembering account details or previous purchases.

Cookies are filed in the memory of your browser and each one typically contains:

  * The name of the server the cookie was sent from
  * The lifetime of the cookie
  * A value – usually a randomly generated unique number
  * Other data a site may have about your browsing that is stored for future use and allows the site to remember your browser.



### Cookies are Secure

The website server which sends the cookie uses the unique number to recognise you when you return to a site or browse from page to page. Only the server that sent a cookie can read, and therefore use, that cookie. Cookies are central to the customisation of the internet and online behavioural advertising usually works using cookies.

### Session and Persistent

There are two types of cookies – session and persistent. Session cookies only exist during a user’s online session and they disappear from the user’s computer when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies stay on your computer after the browser has been closed.

### Web Beacons

Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on web pages that can be used, among other things, to count the users who visit that web page, or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a user viewing that page. Many websites, including Be On may also use Flash cookies that operate similarly to browser cookies.

When you visit the Be On for Publishers websites or view a video distributed within the Be On player, we use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to anonymously track how you use them. Examples of data collected include your IP address, internet browser, operating system, sites you visit, the video that you watch in the Be On player and similar. We may also collect information about how you interact with our website and the Be On player, including what you click on and the content you view to help remember your preferences, measure and research the effectiveness of the Be On service and to customise the content provided via the Be On player.

We may also make use of the Google Analytics service which also tracks your use of our website via anonymous cookies and other means. Data captured or stored using cookies uniquely identifies you to us but does not (on its own) tell us your name or anything else about who you are. We use this information for the following general purposes: to build up an opinion about what kind of content you want to see so that we can filter out things that we think you will not be interested in, in an aggregated form with other data from other users to give us useful information about visitors to our site and users of our player.
