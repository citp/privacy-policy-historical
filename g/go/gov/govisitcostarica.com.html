							GO VISIT COSTA RICA is committed to helping you make the most of your time on our Website within a trusted environment. This privacy policy discloses how we collect, protect, use and share information gathered about you on our Website. Once you have registered with our Website, you will have access to all our copyrighted photos and maps along with the ability to view all public areas of our site. We hope that this disclosure will help increase your confidence in our Website and enhance your experience on the Internet. <br><br>
							This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of our User Agreement and you agree to be bound by its terms and conditions. This policy only addresses our activities from our servers. Other sites (including those that we link to and third party sites or services) may have their own policies, which we do not control, and thus are not addressed by this policy.<br><br>
							<b>DEFINITIONS</b><br>
							"Personal Data" is personal and/or confidential information that relates to you and your account, policy or contract with GO VISIT COSTA RICA.<br><br>
							"Communications" are any non confidential and non proprietary communications information, except for Personal Data, that you transmit to the Site by electronic mail or otherwise, including data, questions, comments and/or suggestions.<br><br>
							"Personal Information" is any Communication where you knowingly enter your personal information such as your name, address, or telephone number. <br><br>
							"Non Personal Information" is any Communication derived from your connection to the Site, such as your Internet browser, domain name and referrer link. <br><br><br>

							GO VISIT COSTA RICA has divided our Privacy Policy into the following 6 parts:<br><br>
							Types of information collected and how we collect it<br>
							How the personally identifiable information is used once collected<br>
							Sharing of your information with other organizations<br>
							Your choices about GO VISIT COSTA RICA collecting, using and sharing your information<br>
							Security provided by GO VISIT COSTA RICA <br>
							Questions or concerns about this privacy policy<br><br><br>

							<b>1. Types of information collected and how we collect it</b><br>
							Visitors simply browsing our site as guest of one of members or potential members are offered access without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you. To become a member of GO VISIT COSTA RICA and start building your detailed listing will be asked to fill out a form. We collect only your name, e-mail address, and country of origin. When you make a purchase, we also collect your street and billing addresses, your phone number, and credit card information. <br><br>
							<b>Information Collected from You with Technology</b><br>
							GO VISIT COSTA RICA will collect some information about you using technology, so it may not be readily apparent to you that it is being collected. For instance, when you come to our site your IP address is collected so that we know where to send information you are requesting. An IP address is often associated with the place from which you enter the Internet like your ISP (Internet service provider), your school, or your university. This information is not personally identifiable. GO VISIT COSTA RICA websites use information collected through technology to make our sites more interesting and useful to you. This includes helping advertisers on our site design advertisements our Guests might like. We normally don't combine this type of information with personally identifiable information. However, we will combine this information with personally identifiable information to identify a visitor in order to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, Guests, or others. <br><br>
							<b>What Are Cookies, and How Does GO VISIT COSTA RICA Use Them?</b><br>
							Cookies are pieces of information that a Website sends to your computer while you are viewing the Website. These pieces of information allow the Website to remember important information that will make your use of that site more useful. GO VISIT COSTA RICA and other Internet companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For instance, we use cookies to remember your login information.
							You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many GO VISIT COSTA RICA features that make your Web experience more efficient -- like the features mentioned above -- and some of our services will not function properly.<br><br>
							<b>2. How the personally identifiable information is used once collected</b><br>
							GO VISIT COSTA RICA uses personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways. We use the information to process your order, or if you contact us for help we will use the information to contact you. Information we collect is used to send you e-mail updates and newsletters about our site and special information.<br><br>

							<b>3. Sharing of your information with other organizations</b><br>
							The most valuable asset of our business is you. We aren't in the business of selling information about our Guests.<br><br>
							<b>Third-Party Advertisers and Network Advertisers</b><br>
							To help increase privacy protections for our Guests, GO VISIT COSTA RICA allows advertising on our sites from only those companies that have their own privacy policy. Once you've clicked on an advertisement and have left GO VISIT COSTA RICA site, our privacy policy no longer applies. You must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their site. 
							In addition, many business advertisements are managed and placed on our site by third-party companies. These companies are called "network advertisers." Network advertisers collect non-personally identifiable information when you click on or scan one of their banner advertisements. The information is collected using technology, so you may not realize it's being collected. The network advertisers collect this information so that they can show you ads that are more relevant and interesting to you.<br><br> 
							<b>4. Your choices about GO VISIT COSTA RICA collecting, using and sharing your information</b><br>
							It is possible for you to use much of our site without giving us any personally identifiable information. When you do register with us or give us personally identifiable information, you will have an opportunity at the time we collect your information -- to limit e-mail communications from GO VISIT COSTA RICA and from our third-party partners. You can request at any time that GO VISIT COSTA RICA not send future e-mail to you either by unsubscribing from the communication or by contacting us through our <a href="/contactUs.asp">contact form</a>. Also, as mentioned above, there are ways to limit the information collected through technology -- though some of our features won't work if you decide to do this.<br><br>
							<b>5. Security provided by GO VISIT COSTA RICA</b><br>
							The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our Guests is of utmost concern to us. GO VISIT COSTA RICA takes technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect all visitors' information. When you provide credit card information, we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect it. GO VISIT COSTA RICA has taken extra measures to protect your security by hosting all of our information behind secure, failover redundant firewalls. 
							There are some things that you can do to help protect the security of your information as well. For instance, never give out your Password, since this is what is used to access all of your account information. Also remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you finish surfing the Web, so that other people using the same computer won't have access to your information.<br><br>


							<b>6. Questions or concerns about this privacy policy</b><br>
							Should you have any further questions or concerns about this privacy policy please send us your questions or comments through our <a href="/contactUs.asp">contact form</a> or write us at:<br><br>
