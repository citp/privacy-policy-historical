  4.     1. The Services are for your personal and noncommercial use. Except as otherwise expressly provided, you may not modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, use, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any information or content contained in the Services as a whole software, or products or services obtained from or available as part of or in conjunction with the Services. You are granted a non-exclusive, non-assignable, and non-transferable license to use the Services only under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
    2. This license is not a sale of any of Company’s rights. The Services may be used only by you, and you may not rent, lease, lend, sub-license, or transfer the Services or any of your rights under this Agreement to anyone else. You may not develop or derive for commercial sale any data in machine-readable or other form that incorporates or uses any substantial part of the Services.

As one of the conditions of your use of the Services, you represent, warrant, and agree that you will not use (or plan, encourage, or help others to use) the Services for any purpose or in any manner that is prohibited by this Agreement or applicable law. It is your responsibility to ensure that your access and use of the Services complies with these Terms and to seek prior written permission from Company for any uses not permitted or not expressly specified herein.
    2. You shall be solely responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all records, data, and information provided, submitted, or uploaded by you in connection with this Agreement or use of the Services.
    3. You will take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized access to the Services. For access to certain areas of the Services, including the account, it may require both a user name and a password. Only one user can use one user name and password and, thus, one account. By limiting access, it helps avoid unauthorized usage by other persons or entities because anyone with knowledge of both your user name and password can gain entry to the Services and your account. Accordingly, by using the Services, you agree to consider your user name and password as confidential information and to keep your user name and password confidential. You also agree not to use another user’s user name and password.

    4. Should you upload or create a job posting on the Services, you represent that you have all necessary rights to make a posting, and you also acknowledge that such postings are non-confidential for all purposes and that Company has no control over the extent to which any idea or information may be used by any party or person once it is posted or displayed. Accordingly, notwithstanding this right and license, it is understood that by merely permitting your information, content, and materials to appear on the Services, Company has not become and is not a publisher of such information, content, and materials and is merely functioning as an intermediary to enable you to provide and display a posting. Moreover, Company assumes no responsibility for the deletion of or failure to store any posting and recommends that you do not post, display, or transmit any confidential or sensitive information.
