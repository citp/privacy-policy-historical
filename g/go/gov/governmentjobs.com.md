# GovernmentJobs | City, State, Federal & Public Sector Jobs

Introduction. The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, these "Terms of Use"), govern your use of services, including any content or functionality offered on or through websites under our control, including www.neogov.com, www.governmentjobs.com, the subdomains and subdirectories of each, and any Add-On Service purchased within a website (collectively referred to as the "Services" for purposes of this Terms of Use), but excluding services that explicitly state they are subject to different terms and conditions. These Terms of Use are entered into by and between you and Governmentjobs.com, Inc. (referred to as "NEOGOV", "we", or "us"). 

"You" access our Services as either a Visitor, Job Seeker, or Personnel. For purposes of this Terms of Use, you are a Visitor if you are just visiting one of our Services. You are a Job Seeker if you hold an account with one or more of our Services for the purpose of receiving and responding to job solicitations. You are Personnel if you are an employee or agent of a Customer (defined below) with authorization to access one or more of our Services on behalf of a Customer, or you hold an account for one or more Services for purposes of accessing employee portals to manage your relationship with a Customer (i.e. your employer).

A "Customer" is defined as an employer or agent of an employer that pays for access to our Services for the purpose of posting job solicitations, recruitment, hiring, onboarding personnel, performance monitoring, training, or other applicable HR services provided by us. If you are a Customer that holds a separately negotiated commercial contract with us that explicitly supersedes or prohibits any end user license or online terms of use, excluding purchases of Add-On Services (see Section 3), the terms and conditions within such commercial contract shall control to the extent of any direct conflict.

Please read the Terms of Use carefully before you start to use the Services.

1\. Provision of Services. By using the Services, executing a document that references them, or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Use when this option is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy incorporated herein by reference. If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Services. Also, by agreeing to this Terms of Use you waive, to the extent permitted under applicable law, any rights or legal requirements that require an original (non-electronic) signature or the delivery or retention of non-electronic records in order for a contract to be legally binding. You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with us and meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Services.

2\. Accessing the Services and Account Security. Subject to your compliance with these Terms of Use, we grant you a non-exclusive, limited, revocable, personal, non-transferable license to use the applicable Services. Unless NEOGOV has entered into a commercial agreement with a Customer permitting you to use the Services for transactions on behalf of another person, you may only use the Services for transactions on your own behalf, and not on behalf of any other person. If you use the Services on behalf of a Customer or natural person, you represent and warrant that you have obtained all required authorizations and consents from the Customer person. 

We reserve the right to withdraw or amend the Services, and any service or material we provide on the Services, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Services is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Services, or the entire Services, to Visitors, Job Seekers, or Personnel. You are responsible for ensuring that all persons who access the Services through your account are aware of these Terms of Use and comply with them.

To access the Services or some of the resources it offers, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. It is a condition of your use of the Services that all the information you provide on the Services is correct, current, and complete. You agree that all information you provide to register with the Services or otherwise, including but not limited to through the use of any interactive features on the Services, is governed by the NEOGOV Privacy Policy [www.neogov.com/privacy-policy](https://www.neogov.com/privacy-policy) and you consent to all actions we take with respect to your information consistent with our Privacy Policy. Terms not defined herein shall retain their meaning as set forth in the NEOGOV Privacy Policy.

If you choose, or are provided with, a user name, password, or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any other person or entity. You also acknowledge that your account is personal to you and agree not to provide any other person with access to the Services or portions of it using your user name, password, or other security information. 

You agree to (i) notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your user name or password or any other breach of security, investigate such breach or such potential breach, (ii) assist us using commercially reasonable efforts in maintaining confidentiality, and (iii) assist us as reasonably necessary to enforce our rights and to enable us to comply with any state or federal law requiring the provision of notice of any security breach with respect to any personally identifiable information of the affected or impacted data subjects. You also agree to ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. You should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information. We have the right to disable any user name, password, or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms of Use.

3\. Add-On Services; Payment.

a. Generally. You may be required to pay fees to access certain add-on features within the Services ("Add-On Service(s)"). Unless otherwise stated by NEOGOV, Add-On Services are governed by the NEOGOV Services Agreement terms most recently published prior to the purchase or renewal of an Add-On Service, as well as these Terms of Use, Service Specifications, and applicable Schedules incorporated therein (available at: [www.neogov.com/service-specifications](https://www.neogov.com/service-specifications)). Where the terms of this Section (Add-On Services; Payment) conflict with the NEOGOV Services Agreement, this Section shall control. Add-On Services may only be available through one or more of our Services and Add-On Services may not be available for all End Users or Customers. 

b. Payment Authorization. You agree to pay to NEOGOV any fees for each Add-On Service you purchase in accordance with the pricing and payment terms presented to you for that Add-On Service. All Add-On Service fees are in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable. If NEOGOV changes the fees for all or part of the Services, including by adding fees or charges, NEOGOV will provide you notice of those changes. If you do not accept the changes, NEOGOV may discontinue providing the applicable part of the Services to you. 

c. Payment Methods. 

i. Debit/Credit Cards. By providing debit or credit card account information through or to the Services, you represent, warrant, and covenant that: (1) you are legally authorized to provide such information to us; (2) you are legally authorized to perform payments from the debit or credit card account(s); (3) the credit card information you provide is correct and you will promptly notify NEOGOV of any changes to such information; and (4) such action does not violate the terms and conditions applicable to your use of such debit or credit card account(s) or applicable law. When you authorize a payment using a debit or credit card account via the Services, you represent, warrant, and covenant that there are sufficient funds or credit available to complete a payment using the debit or credit card account. NEOGOV’s authorized third-party payment processor will charge the payment method you specified at the time of purchase. You authorize NEOGOV to charge all fees as described in these Terms of Use for the Services you select to that payment method, and you authorize our third-party payment processor to use information you provide to process payments, manage debit and credit card information and detect and prevent fraud.

ii. Alternate Payment. In lieu of purchasing Add-On Services via Debit or Credit card, NEOGOV may provide you the option to receive a bill or invoice for payment by alternate means. NEOGOV may align a billing or invoice term with one of your other active Services. Should you elect to receive a bill or invoice for Add-On Service payments, Add-On Service Fees are due net thirty (30) from receipt of NEOGOV bill or invoice. 

d. Add-On Service Subscriptions. The Add-On Services may include features that allow for automatically recurring payments for periodic charges ("Add-On Subscription"). Unless otherwise agreed by NEOGOV, Add-On Subscriptions will be billed in advance on an annual recurring, periodic basis. NEOGOV may also provide pro-rated pricing terms and align Add-On Subscription invoice or billing with SaaS Subscriptions. If you decide to activate an Add-On Subscription, you authorize NEOGOV to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of the recurring payments, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The Add-On Service Subscription Term is a continuous and non-divisible commitment for the full duration of the term regardless of any invoice schedule. The Subscription will commence upon the date you activate or use the Add-On Service. The Subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your Subscription, or we terminate it. You must cancel your Add-On Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic subscription fee to your account. We will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). NEOGOV may change the Subscription Fee for any subsequent Subscription period but will provide you notice of any increase before it applies. Unless otherwise stated in a commercial agreement we negotiated with a Customer, you may cancel an Add-On Subscription by contacting us at: [accounting@neogov.com](mailto:accounting@neogov.com), [customersupport@neogov.com](mailto:customersupport@neogov.com), or alternative means expressly presented to you within the Services. You may cancel auto-renewal on your Add-On Service Subscription at any time, in which case your Add-On Service Subscription will continue until the end of that billing cycle before terminating. 

e. Taxes. Unless otherwise stated, you are responsible for any taxes (other than NEOGOV’s income tax) or duties associated with the sale of the Services, including any related penalties or interest (collectively, "Taxes"). You will pay NEOGOV for the Services without any reduction for Taxes.

f. Purchase Order. If you issue a purchase order, then it shall be for the full amount, and NEOGOV hereby rejects any additional or conflicting terms appearing in a purchase order or any other ordering materials submitted by you, and conditions assent solely based on the terms and conditions this Terms of Use and NEOGOV Services Agreement as offered by NEOGOV. You agree that a failure to provide NEOGOV with a corresponding purchase order shall not relieve you of your obligations to provide payment to NEOGOV.

4\. Termination/Changes to Agreement. Unless otherwise stated herein or as stated in a commercial agreement negotiated between us and a Customer, you may terminate your account at any time. If you terminate your account, you remain obligated to pay all outstanding fees, if any, incurred prior to termination relating to your use of the Services. If you violate any provision of these Terms of Use, your permission from NEOGOV to use the Services will terminate automatically. In addition, NEOGOV may in its sole discretion terminate your account on the Services or suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time for any reason, with or without notice. NEOGOV may alter, suspend or discontinue the Services or any portion of the Services without notice. NEOGOV will not be liable whatsoever for any change to the Services or any suspension or termination of your access to or use of the Services. NEOGOV reserves the right to revise, change, or update these Terms of Use at any time in its sole discretion on a going-forward basis. All changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the Services thereafter. Your continued use of the Services after updates are effective will represent your agreement to the revised version of these Terms of Use. Your continued use of the Services after the effectiveness of such changes will constitute acceptance of and agreement to any such changes. You further waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such changes to these Terms of Use. You are responsible for regularly reviewing these Terms of Use.

If you later withdrawn your consent to using E-Signatures, please notify the sending party and stop using E-Signatures. Note that the decision to stop using E-Signatures after you have already used it does not change the legality of the documents you have previously signed using an electronic signature.

d. E-Signature Validity.

YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH LEGAL COUNSEL CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY DOCUMENT YOU MAY SIGN ELECTRONICALLY USING NEOGOV’S E-SIGNATURE’S.

13\. Text Message and Email Communications. We may offer you the opportunity to receive text message and email notifications regarding notices, reminders, status updates, support, administrative message and disclosures, or other related human resource related notices from us or our Customers. Communications through these methods may be routed through a third-party service.

SMS messages will be sent to you strictly in accordance with your preferences, and only after you have explicitly opted in. If you change your mind at any time, and no longer wish to receive SMS messages, reply to a message with the word "OPTOUT" in all capital letters. Afterwards, should you choose to begin receiving messages again, reply with the word "OPTIN" in all capital letters. Job Seekers may also control their receipt of SMS messages through their Job Seeker Account preferences, by contacting the Customer whom the text message pertains to, or by notifying NEOGOV Support. 

Should you allow SMS messages sent to you by NEOGOV or NEOGOV Customers, you agree to accept such text messages on your mobile phone including messages sent by automated telephone dialing system. You certify that you are the owner of the mobile phone entered or are authorized to use this mobile phone to receive SMS. 

You are responsible for all mobile carrier data or text message charges resulting from your use of the Services, including from any notifications provided by the Services. The number of messages you receive will vary depending on the number of jobs you applied to, jobs you searched for, or the number Customers you allow to contact you. You may receive a text message confirming your subscription. NEOGOV reserves the right to suspend or terminate your SMS messages for any reason, with or without notifying you.

Since these text message services depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays on the part of those providers. NEOGOV may make commercially reasonable efforts to provide alerts in a timely manner with accurate information, but cannot guarantee the delivery, timeliness, or accuracy of the content of any alert. NEOGOV shall not be liable for any delays, failure to deliver, or misdirected delivery of any alert; for any errors in the content of an alert; or for any actions taken or not taken by you or any third party in reliance on an alert. If your mobile number changes, you are responsible for informing the Customer of that change. NEOGOV MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED AS TO: (i) THE AVAILABILITY OF TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES FROM YOUR PROVIDER; (ii) ANY LOSS, DAMAGE, OR OTHER SECURITY INTRUSION OF THE TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES; AND (iii) ANY DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES OR FAILURE TO TRANSMIT ANY DATA, COMMUNICATIONS OR SETTINGS CONNECTED WITH THE SERVICES.

  * Data Access Rights
  * Right to Restrict Processing
  * Right of Rectification
  * Right to be Forgotten

To request to exercise your rights, you may contact us at [privacy@governmentjobs.com](mailto:privacy@governmentjobs.com). Some of the rights are complex, and you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.

## **_Job Seeker Rights._**

You can review and enforce your personal information rights through your Job Seeker account, communications you receive from us, or with the assistance of our support team.

If you apply to a job through a job board powered by us (e.g. Governmentjobs.com, Career Pages, Schooljobs.com, Agency pages) to make applying to future jobs on our Services easier, you create a universal account that persists on www.governmentjobs.com. This account will include your basic profile information. You have the right to delete this universal Governmemtjobs.com account, or any other Job Seeker account you hold, by logging in and following the deletion steps in the account settings.

You have the right to have any inaccurate personal information about you rectified. You can modify or delete personal information within your Job Seeker Profile at any time by logging in to your applicable account and following the prompts to either “update my profile” or “delete my profile.”

Our Services incorporate privacy controls which allow you to specify and limit how we process some of your personal information. For instance, to limit use of your email address, or place global limits on which Customers can preview your Job Seeker Profile, log into your account on [https://www.governmentjobs.com](https://www.governmentjobs.com/) and go to your account settings. Job Seekers can utilize similar privacy controls on a per Customer basis in each Career Page account created.

You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal information and, where we do, access to the personal information. To see whether information on you is retained on our servers, please visit [click here](https://web.archive.org/OnlineApplication/User/AccountVerification). Certain Job Seekers are entitled to request copies of their personal information held by us. You can print a copy of your Profile information using your web browser and download your attachments at any time by logging into your account and following the download process.

To the extent the basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time by using the privacy controls in your account settings or within certain correspondence you receive, by deleting personal information within your Job Seeker Profile, or by deleting your account. If you revoke your consent by deleting your account, your Profile information will be removed from our Job Seeker server, as well as any personal information we shared or received from our affiliated Integrators you utilized; however, revoking your consent will not remove applications you previously submit to Customers.

Upon submission of your application or making your personal information available to one of our Customers (your potential employer), your application becomes the property of the Customer. We are a data processor of Customer information in this regard, and we are not in a position to directly handle data requests for data owned by Customers. Customers may store personal information they receive from you on our servers or their own storage facilities. Customers control the types of personal information requested from you, and how long they retain this personal information. If you would like to learn what personal information Customers maintain about you, access, review, or correct that personal information, you should contact the Customer with any such inquiry. We will cooperate with such inquiry to the extent it is permitted under our confidentiality and privacy obligations.

For inquiries related to resetting your account, if you want to request a restriction or limitation in how we use your personal information, or if you believe someone else has gained access to your account or provided us your contact information, please contact support at: [support@GovernmentJobs.com](mailto:support@GovernmentJobs.com)

## **_Customer and Personnel Rights._**

We are a data processor for personal information Customers’ maintain about Job Seekers and Personnel in our servers. This personal information is Customer property and we maintain limited rights to such data in order to process as necessary to deliver the Services or support to Customers’, to ensure safety and security of our Services, where necessary to protect vital public interests, or as required by law.

Customers are entitled to access, correct, update or delete the Job Seeker and Personnel personal data we hold on the Customers’ behalf and may do so at any time by logging into your account, subject to your access rights. You may download or export most of the personal information you collect through the Services, via the Services. To the extent this section conflicts with specifically agreed contractual terms with you elsewhere, such contract terms those terms shall control.

Personnel rights are subject to Customer internal policies and applicable law. Personnel should contact the Customer (their employer or previous employer) regarding personal information the Customer may hold about them and to exercise any legal rights they may have.

## **_Visitor Rights._**

If you visited our website and you want to exercise any of the above rights please contact our support team or privacy team at the contacts listed herein. If your request is for the right to be forgotten as it relates to our use of cookies, you can achieve this by clearing the cookies in your browser settings.

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our visitors who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

## **_Retention and Removal._**

We retain your personal information for as long as your account is considered active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person, and enforce our agreements.

Our retention policies and procedures are designed to help ensure our compliance with legal obligations and allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. We implement retention controls Customers can utilize within the Services to control their data retention periods.

For personal information we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such information will not be kept for longer than necessary for the purpose, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request, and will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read.

If you are located in the European Union and you do not sign in to your account or interact with our Services for more than five years, your account will expire and be scheduled for removal from our site.

Upon your deletion of your account or any data point within the Job Seeker account or Profile, it will be removed from our Job Seeker database subject to the remainder of this section, but applications you previously submit to Customers will persist until Customer disposal. Put differently, once a Job Seeker sends an application to a Customer using our Services, that Customer will control access and modification rights to that application, as well as the retention period. Job Seekers should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

We may retain your personal information even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, investigate security incidents, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our contractual agreements, or fulfill your request to “unsubscribe” from further messages from us. We will retain anonymized information after your account has been closed.

  * **Security** to protect user accounts, including preventing fraudulent use of login credentials and to protect our Services generally.
  * **Advertising and feedback** to determine whether our advertising and feedback inquiries are received, opened, if the content or campaign is effective, and to provide you more specific content about Services we or our partners offer.
  * **Analysis** to help us analyze the use and performance of our Services, and display different versions of features or content, all of which helps us determine what parts of our Services need improvement and which ones you enjoy most (which may include marketing content).
  * **Google Analytics and Adsense** to analyze the use of our Services and publish advertisements. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.
