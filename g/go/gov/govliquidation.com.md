### Information We Collect When you Place a Bid on Our Website 

When you place a bid for a lot, or are the successful high bidder, LSI collects the following additional information:

  * Your name as it appears on your credit card 
  * Your valid credit card number or other account information
  * The method of payment (VisaÂ™, MasterCardÂ™, American ExpressÂ™, PayPalÂ™, DiscoverÂ™, or wire transfer) 
  * The expiration date of the credit card 
  * The billing address of the cardholder as it appears on your statement 
  * The Card Security Code (located on the back of the card within the signature block)

All information collected is protected by 128-bit encryption, the same security used by financial institutions to protect personal data.

### Information We Collect from Buyers of Export-Restricted Property Purchased from our website: [http://www.govliquidation.com](http://www.govliquidation.com/)

When you have been declared the high bidder on a Special Commodity sales event, LSI collects information from you via the End-Use-Certificate application (DLA Form 1822), which can also be completed online via our **Forms** section (see "End-Use Certificate" form). The information collected via this form (whether completed online or hard copy) is shared with U.S. Government officials for the purpose of clearing purchasers of export-restricted property (Munitions List Items or Commerce Control List Items). Additionally, LSI collects a copy of a government-issued photo identification card, such as a driver license or passport. For corporations, a list of officers and their social security numbers may be required, as well as other information necessary to substantiate a business location. LSI may also use this information for the purpose of collecting money due us in addition to satisfying the Government's requirement to control the sale of export-restricted property.

## Notice to California Residents 

Pursuant to California Civil Code Â§Â§ 1798.80-1798.85 and California Business and Professions Code Â§Â§ 22575 Â– 22579, California residents are entitled to the following rights pertaining to the protection of their personal information. Residents have the right to reasonable security of their personal information by LSI, and to destruction of any personal information that is no longer to be retained by the company via shredding, erasing or otherwise modifying the personal information contained in the records so as to make them indecipherable. Residents have a right to expect that a business that discloses personal information about a California resident pursuant to a contract with a nonaffiliated third party shall require by contract that the third party implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information, to protect the personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. Residents have a right to timely notification by LSI if we become aware of an unauthorized disclosure or acquisition of your personal information. Residents have the right to be informed by LSI's customer relations staff of how they can inquire about our privacy practices or compliance with the above-referenced California laws.

## How does LSI collect information about you? 

Most of the information LSI collects about you is information that is voluntarily provided by you when you register for an account or place a bid on one of our websites. Other information is available to us when you click on one of our websites, and is collected electronically via cookies ****and our web engine. Some information we may request from you, such as utility bills, bank statements, or letters of guarantee or reference, or a D &B number, the first time you place a bid with us. We collect this information to verify that you are a financially responsible bidder, and not disrupting the bids of legitimate buyers.

## Why do we collect personal information? 

LSI collects personal information either for the purposes of establishing a business relationship (the information you give us when you register for an account on our web site), to collect payment for items you have bid on, to tailor the type of information that we provide to you regarding property that is available for purchase, or to meet a requirement established by the Government (i.e., EUC applications, FDA certificates or re-sale certificates, compliance with a subpoena, court order, or law enforcement request in connection with an official investigation).

## How do we use the information we collect? 

Information collected by LSI is used to communicate with you when we transact business. Whether it is to notify you that you have been awarded a lot, or to notify you that you have been outbid on an item, or to contact you regarding payment, we use the information provided by you to facilitate the transactions you wish to consummate with us. We do not sell customer information to third parties. LSI verifies your personal information against a third-party vendor database, to which we provide some of your personal information for purposes of identity verification and purchase authorization. The identity verification and purchase authorization processes are automated with some manual overrides. We also run information provided by you during account registration against private databases such as LexisNexis, and against watch lists maintained by the U.S. Government via the Excluded Party List System ([www.epls.gov](http://www.epls.gov/)). Information provided via the "End-Use-Certificate" form (specific to some purchases on [www.govliquidation.com](http://www.govliquidation.com/)) and any supplemental requests pursuant to the processing of that form for the Government is used for the purpose of determining whether the Government will permit the sale of export-restricted property to an individual or entity, or to collect money owed the company by the individual or entity. We will not release your personal information to any third party without your consent, unless we are required to by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with an official investigation by a law enforcement organization.

LSI may provide transaction-related information to Government or private auditors for the purpose of inspecting or validating our business practices, accounting records or financial reports. Any release of information for such a purpose will be done under standard confidentiality restrictions.

Before we alter the reason for using any personal information you have provided to us, we will notify you of our intended change in use of that information and obtain your consent prior to using your personal information in a new way.

## Choice / Opt-Out / Deletion

Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving Buyer Alert emails from us at the point where we request information about the visitor, and at any time the user may contact us and request to have their information removed from the database. For more information on how to opt out of buyer alert emails from a specific website, please review the Help section of that website or contact its dedicated Buyer Relations team.

## Other websites we link with

We may link to other websites which are not within our control. Once you have left our website, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide. We recommend that you exercise caution whenever providing information over the Internet. It is always a good idea to check the privacy policy of any website you visit.

## What steps do we take to secure your personal information? 

All employees having access to personal protected information must undergo data protection training at least once a year and are monitored by management to ensure that adequate safeguards are used to protect the private information of our customers. Our websites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our websites use SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption for all sensitive data that is transmitted over the Internet. This includes customers adding data to the web site, and employees transmitting data off the web site. No information, including the passwords that would give access to sensitive information ever flows over the Internet un-encrypted.

## Return of Personal Information

At any time, a User may request that LSI discontinue the use of that person's personal information. If you would like to know what information LSI has collected, would like to have any information purged or would like for LSI to discontinue using personal information, please contact our Privacy Officer at privacy@liquidityservicesinc.com. Please bear in mind that the return of certain personal information by LSI may prevent you from accessing all or certain portions of our websites, and we will endeavor to communicate to you the extent to which your request will impact your use of our websites prior to complying with your request.

Do not tell your password to anyone. LSI personnel will never ask you for your password as a means of verifying your identity.
