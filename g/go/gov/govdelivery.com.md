# Privacy Policy | GovDelivery: eMail & Digital Subscription Management for Government

What is GovDelivery?  
GovDelivery is a hosted Web application that allows governments and other organizations to improve distribution of documents and information.

 **What information does GovDelivery collect?   How is that information used?**  
GovDelivery only collects personally identifiable information about you to the extent you specifically provide it to us.  This includes, for example, the information you provide when you register to receive subscriptions or notices related to a document provided by one of the organizations that we have partnered with.

**Information you provide when using GovDelivery:**  
We use this information you share with us: 

  * to provide the services you request,
  * to improve the content of the Web site, and
  * for announcements related to new content on the portion of the site you were using when you provided the information.



We never share information gathered through our clients with third parties for promotional purposes.

However, we grant select outside vendors limited and controlled access to this information.  These vendors do not use it for any purpose other than to enhance our ability to deliver services to you and other customers and are bound to keep the information confidential.

In some cases, our client organizations using the GovDelivery service (such as governmental and public bodies) have ownership of the information and its privacy and use is subject to that client organization's separate privacy policy.  We will also share this information with outside parties as required by law.

**Other information about you**  
In addition to information you provide (e-mail address, password, subscriptions, preferences), GovDelivery uses technology that lets us know what type of browser you are using, the Web site from which you enter _GovDelivery_ , and which GovDelivery pages you view.  This technology does not identify you personally — it simply helps us compile statistics about our visitors and their use of the GovDelivery application.  We use these statistics and share them with third parties only to improve our Web site design and content and in connection with marketing programs.

**Cookies**  
Users browsing documents from one of our clients will receive a "session cookie" that is stored on the user's computer only until they close the browser.  The session cookie allows the server software to keep the user logged in as they browse GovDelivery.  The cookie is not shared with other websites, does not track or store personal information, and expires as soon as the user closes the browser.

**What if you do not wish to have your information stored by GovDelivery for any reason or purpose?**  
If you have provided your information to GovDelivery for whatever reason and would prefer that GovDelivery not store your information for any purpose, simply visit GovDelivery to cancel your subscription and delete your profile.  You can also request removal from our database by sending an e-mail to [REMOVE](mailto:info@govdelivery.com) stating your request.  We will act promptly to honor your request.  

**Children**  
GovDelivery does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.  If a child has provided GovDelivery with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian send an e-mail to [SUPPORT](mailto:info@govdelivery.com) with the child's name and we will do our best to delete the information from our files.

**Your Consent**  
By using the GovDelivery Web site, you consent to our use of the information you provide to us as described in this Online Privacy Policy.  As we implement new technology and introduce new services, we will update our Online Privacy Policy, so we encourage you to review it often.

**EU Safe Harbor**  
GovDelivery, Inc. abides by the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding collection, use and retention of data from the European Union.
