# GovWin Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At the GovWin network we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
  * We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
  * We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public, and what's permanently deleted.



Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: Deltek, Inc. ("Deltek") operates GovWin.com. It is Deltek´s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Deltek collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Deltek´s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Deltek´s visitors use the GovWin website. From time to time, Deltek may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its GovWin website.

Deltek also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Deltek does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Deltek´s websites choose to interact with Deltek in ways that require Deltek to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Deltek gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask all visitors who sign up for a user account at GovWin.com to provide a username and email address. Deltek does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

Deltek may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Deltek may monitor the most popular content contributions on the GovWin.com site. Deltek may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Deltek does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Deltek discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Deltek´s behalf or to provide services available at Deltek´s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Deltek´s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Deltek will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Deltek discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Deltek believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Deltek, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the GovWin website and have supplied your email address, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what´s going on with Deltek, GovWin, and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Deltek takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor´s computer, and that the visitor´s Internet browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Deltek uses cookies to help Deltek identify and track visitors, their usage of the GovWin website, and their website access preferences. GovWin visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the GovWin websites, with the drawback that certain features of the GovWin website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Deltek may change its Privacy Policy from time to time in its sole discretion. Deltek encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this GovWin website after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
