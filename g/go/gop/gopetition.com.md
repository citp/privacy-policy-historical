Gopetition.com - Privacy Statement

Understanding

Gopetition.com recognises that your privacy is very important to you and that you have a right to control your personal information. We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. 

Your email address or street address will NEVER be displayed on this website.

We will not email you anything unrelated to Gopetition.com, nor will your details be given or sold to third parties by us. If your email address is supplied, it will be stored securely and used only for petition signature verification.

Your information

Gopetition.com will not give or sell your information to any third party. You will not receive email or any other correspondance from any third party. We will send you information ONLY if it has been directly requested by you. 

When signing a petition, your information can be accessed by the petition's author. This is necessary to validate the signature, and hence the petition.  The author agrees to use signatures responsibly. Petition targets will also ultimately view the signature list.
