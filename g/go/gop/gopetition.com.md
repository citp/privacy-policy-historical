# Privacy Policy | GoPetition

GoPetition recognises that your privacy is very important to you and that you have a right to control your personal information. We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. This privacy policy forms part or our Terms of Use (TOU) and is subject to and should be read with our TOU. 

**Your email address will NEVER be displayed on this website. Email addresses are stored confidentially and securely with multi-layer protection.**

We will not email you anything unrelated to GoPetition. If your email address is supplied, it will be stored securely. 

If you are signing a petition, you may be sent a signature receipt by email that confirms that you have signed the petition. The receipt is for your records and provides information about how to edit and manage your signature. Your email address may be used for signature verification by GoPetition when we conduct quality control of a signature list. This is important to maintain high standards of signature list integrity. Quality signature lists promote quality petitions and successful campaigns. 

### Your information

GoPetition will not give or sell your personal information to any third party. If signing a petition, your information can be accessed by the petition's author. Petition authors agree to use signatures responsibly, legally and in compliance with our Terms and this Privacy Policy. This may involve the author contacting you about the campaign you have supported at GoPetition. Authors also have permission to forward petition signatures to the relevant petition's target, so petition targets may also ultimately view signature details. Authors agree not to republish petition signatures on any other website or public media forum. 

### Signature and Signature Comment Display and Search Engine Access to Signature Lists and Signature Comments

If you are signing a petition your signature and signature comment ( **excluding your email address and street address** ) may be publicly displayed in a signature list (and signature comment page). Each petition at GoPetition has a public signature list that publicly displays at GoPetition all those who sign each petition. **Our public lists do not include email or street addresses** , but may include your town/city. Comments made with a signature can appear on a dedicated signature comment page. 

The public lists and comments give weight to each petition and confidence to other signers. Each author has the option to NOT display their list publicly. But you should assume that the author may display their list. If you choose our "Anonymous" designation feature, then your name will be cloaked publicly and will only be viewable to the author and target. You may also elect to hide your signature comment from public view if you only want the author or target to view your comment. 

Please note that search engines such as Google and Yahoo may be able to view your signature and signature comment and may index your signature and signature comment (if made). You may prevent indexing by cloaking your signature with an "Anonymous" designation and by "hiding" your comment. GoPetition members may now edit their signatures (including comments) to encourage or hide from search engine exposure. For information about how to edit your signature please read our FAQ. 

### Facebook comments

If you use the facebook comment facility on any petition then your name and facebook photo may appear on the GoPetition site. GoPetition uses a facebook plugin for the facebook comment facility. GoPetition does not guarantee that attempts to edit facebook comments by users of this facility will result in the desired editorial results. Any use of the facebook comment facility is at the user's own risk. 

### GoPetition's use of Google Maps software

GoPetition generates signature maps powered by a special application of Google Maps known as MarkerClusterer. This software collects signature markers into different clusters and displays the number of markers in each cluster with a label, creating new clusters as the map zoom level changes. Signature maps at GoPetition can be used for a variety of purposes, electoral and otherwise. Maps at GoPetition do NOT label any particular signer, nor are they intended to. The maps are simply designed to give a geographical overview of supporter interest. You should be aware that any geographical information you provide may be used to generate maps at GoPetition.

Our partners may link the non-personal information we share with them to the cookie stored on your browser or device, and they may collect information such as your IP address, browser or operating system type and version, and demographic or inferred-interest information.
