This privacy policy only applies to transactions and activities in which you engage, and data gathered, on the goplan.org, goplanapp.com and goplan.info websites (and sub-domains) but does not apply to any other Website or offline point of contact between webreakstuff.com, or any other company, and consumers. Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may modify it from time to time. This privacy policy was last revised on January 25, 2007. Each time you visit the Site or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time.
