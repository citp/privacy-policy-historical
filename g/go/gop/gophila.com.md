**Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corporation Privacy Policy**

The Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corporation and its respective successors and assigns (“GPTMC,” “we,” “us” or “our”) welcome you. GPTMC maintains numerous websites (collectively, the “GPTMC Sites”) in furtherance of its mission of promoting tourism in the Philadelphia region. The GPTMC Sites include, without limitation, the following websites that are the property of GPTMC: [www.visitphilly.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20120920073015id_/http://www.visitphilly.com/privacy-policy/www.visitphilly.com), [press.visitphilly.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20120920073015id_/http://www.visitphilly.com/privacy-policy/press.visitphilly.com), [www.uwishunu.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20120920073015id_/http://www.visitphilly.com/privacy-policy/www.uwishunu.com), [food.visitphilly.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20120920073015id_/http://www.visitphilly.com/privacy-policy/food.visitphilly.com), [phillyhomegrown.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20120920073015id_/http://www.visitphilly.com/privacy-policy/phillyhomegrown.com), [philly360.visitphilly.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20120920073015id_/http://www.visitphilly.com/privacy-policy/philly360.visitphilly.com), [philly360.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20120920073015id_/http://www.visitphilly.com/privacy-policy/philly360.com), [withart.visitphilly.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20120920073015id_/http://www.visitphilly.com/privacy-policy/withart.visitphilly.com), [phillyphlash.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20120920073015id_/http://www.visitphilly.com/privacy-policy/phillyphlash.com) and [philadelphia.travel](https://web.archive.org/web/20120920073015id_/http://www.visitphilly.com/privacy-policy/philadelphia.travel). This GPTMC Online Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes the types of personal, financial and other information that we gather from visitors who use or access the web content, products, technology and services provided by GPTMC and available on the GPTMC Sites (collectively, the “GPTMC Services”) and how we use the information that we gather. Please carefully read the Privacy Policy before accessing the GPTMC Services as it applies to all persons and entities who use or access the GPTMC Services, including you (each a “User”), and constitutes an agreement between you and GPTMC. **By accessing the GPTMC Services, you signify that you have read the Privacy Policy and agree to be bound by it and the GPTMC Terms of Use Agreement (“Terms”) available at[www.visitphilly.com/terms-of-use](http://www.visitphilly.com/terms-of-use/), as well as any applicable laws and regulations. We may update the Privacy Policy from time to time. Each time you use any of the GPTMC Services, the current version of the Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, when you use the GPTMC Services, you should check the date of the Privacy Policy (which appears at the top) and review any changes. If you do not agree with the Privacy Policy, you may not access or otherwise use the GPTMC Services.**

**1\. Overview on Collection and Sharing of Information**

The Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to GPTMC through the GPTMC Services. It does not apply to information that GPTMC may have obtained through other means, including but not limited to traditional mailing lists. GPTMC allows a number of vendors to offer their services (each a “Vendor”) through the GPTMC Sites. Information that you provide to a Vendor is governed by that Vendor’s policies and procedures.

Information that we gather from Users falls into two broad categories: Personal Data and Aggregate Data.

**2\. Collection and Sharing of Personal Data**

Personal Data is information that could reasonably be used to identify you, such as your name, address, email address, birth date, financial information, telephone number or any combination of the foregoing (“Personal Data”). We use Personal Data to provide you with GPTMC Services that you have requested. By voluntarily providing Personal Data, you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Data in accordance with the Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to provide the requested Personal Data or if you do not agree to have us use the information for the purposes identified, it is your responsibility to decline to use of those GPTMC Services for which the Personal Data is sought. You can access and enjoy a wide range of GPTMC Services without providing us with any Personal Data. However, certain GPTMC Services do require that you provide some amount of Personal Data. For example, and without limitation, Users who wish to use the Contact Us and Newsletter Sign-Up, participate in a contest or survey, create a User account, link to third party websites through the GPTMC Services, and communicate with GPTMC via electronic mail, may be required to provide varying amounts of Personal Data. When you submit Personal Data to us, we may add it to our database. Personal Data may also be disclosed to GPTMC employees, independent contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve the GPTMC Services.

You can request to review, change, update or delete Personal Data that you have previously submitted to us. We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before we grant you access to your Personal Data and comply with your request. Please be aware that even after such a request is processed, GPTMC may, for a time, retain residual information about you in our backup and/or archival copies of our database.

**3\. Collection and Sharing of Aggregate Data**

Aggregate Data is information that does not personally identify you such as frequency of visits to the GPTMC Sites, page views, GPTMC Services most frequently accessed, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, referrer addresses, where your computer is routing from, your browser type and version, or your operating system and platform (“Aggregate Data”). We use Aggregate Data to help us develop and improve the GPTMC Services overall.

_Cookies._ Cookies are pieces of information that websites transfer to your computer’s web browser for storage on your computer’s hard drive. GPTMC uses persistent cookies on the GPTMC Sites. A persistent cookie will remain on your hard drive even after you leave a given website and close your browser. When you return to the same website that placed the cookie on your hard drive, the website may then access the cookie.

GPTMC uses cookies for the purpose of distinguishing your browser as a previous visitor to the GPTMC Sites by tracking repeat visits to the GPTMC Sites by you through your IP address. GPTMC also uses cookies to identify which parts of the GPTMC Sites are most visited by you and how much time you spend in a particular part of the GPTMC Sites. The cookie is loaded on your browser during the initial visit to the GPTMC sites. The cookies GPTMC uses do not collect personally identifiable information from you such as names, addresses or email addresses. Only your IP address and a time stamp of your arrival are collected.

The information collected by GPTMC through cookies is used strictly for statistical analysis of usage trends related to the GPTMC Sites. GPTMC does not share, sell, transfer or provide any information collected through cookies to any third parties. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you turn off cookies or refuse them, though, you may not be able to use every portion of the GPTMC Sites.

_Pixel Tags._ We use a third party, Atlas DMT, to measure ad performance tracking. The third party may collect anonymous information about your use of the GPTMC Services through the use of a technology device, commonly referred to as a pixel tag, which we place on various web pages within the GPTMC Sites and that allows the third party to collect anonymous information. The third party reports the anonymous data that they collect on our behalf back to us, which we may link to your personally identifiable information. When we link this information, it is treated under the Privacy Policy as Personal Data. You may opt-out of pixel tags. To learn about how to opt-out, visit the Atlas DMT privacy page: [atlassolutions.com/privacy-policy](http://atlassolutions.com/privacy-policy).

_Click-Throughs._ GPTMC or a third party authorized by GPTMC may send email messages which use a “click-through” text or graphic link that will take you to content on the GPTMC Sites. When you click on this link, you pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. If we use this feature, we will track click-through data to help determine our users’ interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked by using click-throughs, do not click text or graphic links in the email.

_Advertising._ The GPTMC Sites may contain advertisements provided by third party advertisers (each an “Advertiser”). An Advertiser may place or utilize its own cookie on your browser, and may collect Aggregate Data about your visit to the GPTMC Sites, including but not limited to the number of times you viewed an advertisement. If an Advertiser requests that you provide any Personal Data, that Advertiser’s use and collection of the information will be governed by the Advertiser’s own privacy policy, and not our Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review any Advertiser’s privacy policy before providing Personal Data.

**4\. Opting Out of Certain Communications**

Users are given the choice to opt-out of certain optional communications from us and our affiliates and marketing partners. To “opt-out” you may send an opt-out request to us at [questions@visitphilly.com](mailto:questions@visitphilly.com) with the word “unsubscribe” in the email subject line. Users should specify whether they are seeking to opt-out of the visitphilly.com list or the GPTMC press distribution list in the body of the email and allow a reasonable amount of time for the opt-out request to be processed. Please be aware that your opt-out choice may mean that certain features and functions of the GPTMC Services will no longer be available to you.

**5\. Sharing, Selling and Trading Aggregate Data Collected Online With Third Parties**

GPTMC takes the privacy of our Users very seriously. We do not sell, rent or otherwise provide your Personal Data to third parties for marketing purposes without your prior consent. We may however sell, share or trade Aggregate Data to third parties. 

**6\. Disclosures Required by Law**

It is possible that we may need to disclose Personal Data when required by law, such as responses to civil or criminal subpoenas, or other requests by law enforcement personnel, to establish or exercise our legal rights or, defend against legal claims and if in our judgment in such circumstances disclosure is required or appropriate. 

We may also share Personal Data if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms, or as otherwise required by law. 

**7\. Disclosures Required by Law**

We may disclose your Personal Data and Aggregate Data to a third party as part of a reorganization or a sale of the assets of GPTMC. Any third party to which we transfer or sell GPTMC assets will have the right to continue to use the Personal Data and Aggregate Data that you provide to us, subject to this Privacy Policy as may be amended. 

**8\. Credit Card Information**

GPTMC does not collect credit card information from Users. However, if you choose to enter into a transaction with a Vendor, including but not limited to a hotel booking with World Choice Travel, you should be aware that the Vendor may request that you provide your credit card information. Such transactions do not take place on the GPTMC Sites and GPTMC is not responsible for the processing or security of such transactions.

**9\. Children and Privacy**

We are concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet, and understand that children may not understand all the provisions of our Privacy Policy or make informed decisions about the choices that are made available to adult users of the GPTMC Services. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be familiar with the sites their children visit. The GPTMC Services are not directed to children under the age of 13. If we learn that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data, we will comply with Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) to delete the information or obtain verifiable parental consent in accordance with COPPA.

**10\. International Transmission of Data**

The Internet is a global environment. Using the Internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. This means that your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. By using GPTMC Services and/or communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge and agree to our processing of your Personal Data in this manner, and agree to be bound by the applicable privacy laws that GPTMC is governed by as well as the jurisdiction and venue provisions of the GPTMC Terms.

**11\. Links to Other Websites**

The GPTMC Services contain links to websites operated by other people or companies. The Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third party sites, which may have their own privacy policies or no privacy policy at all. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, GPTMC does not control the content of third party sites and takes no responsibility for their content, nor should it be implied that GPTMC endorses or otherwise recommends such sites or the products or services offered. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of use of any third party sites or services before providing any of them with any of your personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies only to the GPTMC Services.

_GPTMC Vendor Sites._ Sites hosted by Vendors may be accessed through the GPTMC Services. In some cases, these sites may maintain the look and feel of the GPTMC Sites. Nonetheless they are governed by the Vendor’s policies and not those of GPTMC. It is your responsibility to review the relevant privacy policies prior to accessing the services available on such Vendors sites. Vendor sites that maintain the look and feel of GPTMC Sites are the following:  


  

  1. World Choice Travel. When you click on an online reservation link, you will be transferred to World Choice Travel, our online hotel reservation system partner. It will appear as if you are still on the GPTMC Sites. Please review the World Choice Travel privacy policy prior to submitting credit card information to World Choice Travel or using any World Choice Travel services. The World Choice Privacy Policy is available here: [www.wctravel.com/corp/privacyStatement.html](http://www.wctravel.com/corp/privacyStatement.html).
  2. Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance. When you view the events calendar, you will be transferred to the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance website, which owns and operates phillyfunguide.com. It will appear as if you are still on the GPTMC Sites. Please review the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance privacy policy prior to using any Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance services. The Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance privacy policy is available here: [www.philaculture.org/privacy](http://www.philaculture.org/privacy).
  



**12\. Security**

GPTMC uses a variety of safeguards to protect your Personal Data. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot ensure or warrant its absolute security. Consequently, when you transmit your Personal Data to us, you do so at your own risk. We use physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards and other appropriate measures to protect your Personal Data against unauthorized access or use, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction and accidental loss.

If you create a User account, your account information will be password protected. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your login information, password and to your computer. Be sure to log off from the GTPMC Services when finished using a shared computer. We strongly request you not to communicate any confidential information to GPTMC through email or any other means. 

If GPTMC learns of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the GPTMC Services or providing Personal Data to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security and privacy issues related to the GPTMC Services. GPTMC will endeavor to provide notice to you of any security systems breach and efforts to restore the integrity of the GPTMC Services in accordance with applicable law. If you become aware of any breach of data security or have any other questions about the security of the GPTMC Services, please contact us at: [questions@visitphilly.com](mailto:questions@visitphilly.com).

**13\. Changes to Privacy Policy**

We will post material changes to this Privacy Policy here at least 10 business days before they take effect. Any information we collect under the current Privacy Policy will remain subject to the terms of this Policy, until you accept the new Privacy Policy by accessing or using the GPTMC Services after the changes take effect.
