## Non-Personally-Identifiable User Information

For each visitor to our websites, we collect non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, preferences, technical session information, & browser type. This data is used to manage the website, track website usage, provide context for referring traffic sources, and improve overall website performance. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to visitors, to understand how anonymous users interact with our website after seeing GoPro advertisements on 3rd party websites, to identify & retarget advertisements to past website visitors, & to optimize the performance of our advertising campaigns. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes. If you arrived at our website via a link from another webpage, we may receive aggregate or otherwise anonymous statistical information about your visit to our site.

### Use of Cookies

GoPro uses cookies to store visitors’ preferences and to record session information, such as pages visited, interactions with website features, time spent on the website, shopping cart items, language preference, intended shipping region, & purchase behavior for purposes that include ensuring that visitors are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements, to tailor website content & newsletter communications according to visitor preferences, to serve online advertisements based on past visitors to the website, & to inform and optimize website performance & online advertising campaigns.

### Web Beacons

One or more of our third party advertising partners employ a software technology called Web Beacons, that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Web Beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

### Ad Servers, Third Party Advertising, & Website Analytics

We do not serve 3rd party advertisements to you while using our website, GoPro.com. However, we do work with Website analytics & advertising partners, including Google, Doubleclick, AdRoll, Commission Junction & Facebook, to deliver GoPro advertisements on 3rd party publisher websites – these partners may set cookies on your computer’s web browser. These cookies allow our partners to recognize your computer so that the ad server can show you GoPro advertisements elsewhere on the Internet, and so that our analytics software can measure your engagement & interactions while using GoPro.com. In this way, ad servers may compile anonymous, non-personally identifiable information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw our advertisements, whether or not you interacted with our advertisements, and actions performed on subsequent visits to GoPro.com. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you, and it allows GoPro to optimize the performance of our advertising campaigns and the usability of our website. In other words, we use analytics data in concert with data about our online ads that have been shown using the Google Display Network, DoubleClick for Advertisers, or other online advertising networks. Thus, an we can understand how anonymous users interacted with our website after seeing our ads.

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by GoPro and relevant ad serving, website feature, & analytics partners, and does not cover the use of cookies by 3rd party advertisers.
