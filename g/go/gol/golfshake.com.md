This includes, as appropriate: the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data; the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

The information that you provide to us will be held securely in our systems, which are located on our premises or those of an appointed third party. We will only allow access to your personal data by third parties who act for us for the purposes described in this privacy policy or for other purposes approved by you.

We will only retain your personal data for as long as is appropriate and necessary to the fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, taking into account the amount, nature and sensitivity of the data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.  We will limit the period for which personal data is stored to a minimum. We will set time limits for erasure or periodic review.  You may request details of our retention policy and in addition, you have a right to have your personal data restricted or erased – see more details under “Your Rights” below.

##  4\. Your rights

Your rights under the Data Protection Laws in relation to your personal data include (but are not limited to) the following:

You have the legal right to ask us to supply you with a copy of the personal data that we hold about you at any time free of charge.  Further copies may incur a reasonable fee and also if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive (or we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances).

You can also ask us to rectify any errors in your personal data or complete any incomplete data that we hold or you can update your own details at any time by accessing your online account in our secure customer portal.

Where you have given your consent to our processing your data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent and there is no other legal ground for us to process your data, you can ask us to erase your personal data. You can also require us to erase your data if we have processed your data unlawfully or if the law requires us to erase your data.  Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

You may also restrict the processing of your data: This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data if: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

You may request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

##  5\. Sharing your Personal Data

We will share your personal data with suppliers or other third parties only on the legal basis indicated in this Privacy Policy to provide services and functionality as outlined in this Privacy Policy.  Our “third party data processors” (such as our fulfilment partners, hosting providers, digital agencies, data storage providers and other technical partners) help us administer and delivery the services to this website, and may have access to your data which is submitted for processing as indicated in this Privacy Policy through legitmate interests and legal basis.

Transfers outside of the EEA: Where we need to transfer your data to a third party supplier or service provider based in a country located outside of the EEA,  for the purposes of the third party providing us with a service, we will ensure that either the country to which the data is to be transferred has an adequate level of protection for data (as determined by the European Commission) or we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe or where a supplier or service provider is based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they have certified to the Privacy Shield Framework Principles which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

We will share your personal data with any member of our group of companies (which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the Companies Act 2006) for internal administrative purposes including processing of personal data on the basis of being in our legitimate interests to do so.  We ensure that our group companies follow the same rules when processing your personal data. These rules are called “binding corporate rules”.

If the shares in Golfshake or substantially all of our assets are sold to a third party, your personal data may be disclosed to the prospective buyer during the sale negotiations and on conclusion of the sale will be transferred as a company asset to the third party. This is necessary for our legitimate interests to be able to sell the company or its assets in the future, provided that we take all appropriate steps to keep your personal data confidential and secure at all times in accordance with this Policy and the Data Protection Laws, including requiring the third party to sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement.

Other than as previously stated, we will only disclose or share your personal data if necessary to comply with any legal obligation or in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements with you, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Golfshake, our customers or others.
