# GoldMoney - Privacy Policy

GoldMoney respects your privacy. All information collected by GoldMoney will be kept strictly confidential and will not be disclosed without your express consent except when GoldMoney is required to provide information pertaining to you in order to ensure compliance with any form of legal process or when GoldMoney is required, in order to fulfil its obligations in terms of the User Agreement, to disclose information pertaining to you to its agents or third-party business affiliates.

All customer records are kept safe and secure in GoldMoney's office and servers in Jersey, Channel Islands, a 700 year old sovereign country. Jersey has become a major financial centre because it relies upon Anglo-Saxon common law, which puts property rights at the forefront. GoldMoney considers privacy to be an important property right.

At any time you may access and change your personal information that is in the possession of GoldMoney by logging into your Holding and by clicking the "Main > Holding Details" link.

GoldMoney does not sell, rent, loan, trade or lease any personal information collected, including application forms, financial data or e-mail addresses. GoldMoney may ask for your permission by e-mail to disclose your personal data, but you have the right to refuse.

For security reasons, we do not recommend saving your Holding number and Passphrase in your computer's memory (do not allow your browser to remember your Passphrase). Consequently, we advise entering your Holding number and Passphrase each time you begin a new browser session and wish to view your Holding. Please read our [Security FAQ](https://web.archive.org/en/faqs/security.html) for important tips on accessing GoldMoney securely.
