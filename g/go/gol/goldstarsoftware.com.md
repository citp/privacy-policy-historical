# Information Use Policy | Goldstar Software

## Mailing List and Web Site User Accounts

The information collected by our web site is exclusively for our internal use and will not be resold to any other company. In fact, it is quite possible that even WE will never use it. You do not need to provide anything more than basic contact information (i.e. Email address and first name). Other data fields, while helpful in knowing our customers' locations throughout the world, are not required and may be omitted.

If you sign up for our mailing list, you will receive the Goldstar Software Meteor -- our newsletter that covers events of the day in the environments we support, including Actian (PSQL and other products), Carbonite (Availability and other products), and others. Note that the Meteor is not on a regular schedule, but we rarely send more than two messages per month, unless some very unusual things are happening in our universe.

If you sign up for our PSQL Tech Tip series, you will receive one new Email every "Tech Tip Tuesday" which will give you some tips on using the PSQL database and its tools.

Of course, you can always [change your delivery preferences](https://web.archive.org/web/20190618013402id_/http%3A//www.goldstarsoftware.com/mledit.asp) or [delete your account completely](https://web.archive.org/web/20190618013402id_/http%3A//www.goldstarsoftware.com/mlremove.asp) at any time.
