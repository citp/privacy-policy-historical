The information collected by our web site is used exclusively for our internal use, and will not be resold to any other company for any low price. (If you are interested in spending $10,000 per name for our mailing list, please call us!) 

In fact, it is quite possible that even we will never use it.

If you request information in the comments section, we will try to provide that information to you as best that we can, and will respond via E-mail if you entered a valid E-mail address.

If you would like any marketing literature mailed to you, please indicate this in the comments section. We are a small company, and all our marketing materials are on our web site. You can also download them and save us some postage!
