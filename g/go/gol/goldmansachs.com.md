**Your Privacy Is Important To Goldman Sachs**

In the course of serving you as an individual client or as someone associated with a corporate or institutional client, Goldman Sachs may obtain personal information about you. Obtaining this information is important to our ability to deliver the highest level of service to you, but we also recognize that you expect us to treat this information appropriately.

This Policy describes the types of personal information we may collect about you, the purposes for which we use the information, the circumstances in which we may share the information, and the steps that we take to safeguard the information to protect your privacy. As used throughout this Policy, the term “Goldman Sachs” refers to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its affiliates worldwide . 

**The Sources of Information**

The personal information we collect about you comes primarily from the account applications or other forms and materials you submit to Goldman Sachs during the course of your relationship with us. We may also collect information about your transactions and experiences with Goldman Sachs relating to the products and services Goldman Sachs provides. In addition, depending on the products or services you require, Goldman Sachs may obtain additional information about you, such as your credit history, from consumer reporting agencies.

Finally, in the provision of financial services to you and subject to strict compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, information may be collected about you indirectly from monitoring or other means (e.g., recording of telephone calls and monitoring e-mails). In these circumstances, the information is not accessed on a continuous or routine basis but it may be used for compliance or security purposes. 

**The Information We Have About You**

If you deal with Goldman Sachs in your individual capacity (e.g., as a private client), or as a settlor/trustee/beneficiary of a trust, or as an owner or principal of a company or other investment vehicle established to invest on your behalf or on behalf of your family, etc., the typical information we collect about you would include:

  * Your name, address and other contact details;
  * Your age, occupation and marital status;
  * Extensive financial information, including source of wealth, investment experience and objectives, risk tolerance and, in certain jurisdictions, representations required under applicable law or regulation concerning your financial resources ; 
  * A head and shoulders photograph from, as applicable, your passport, national identity card or driver's license, as required by laws and regulations addressing due diligence and related matters; and
  * A personal identifier such as, depending on your country of residence, your Social Security Number, National Insurance Number, Tax File Number, etc. 



If you are an employee/officer/director/principal, etc. of one of our corporate or institutional clients, the typical information we collect about you personally would include:

  * Your name and contact details; 
  * Your role/position/title and area of responsibility; and
  * Certain identifying information (e.g., passport photo, etc.) as required by laws and regulations addressing money laundering and related matters.



Of course, you are not required to supply any of the personal information that we may request. However, failure to do so may result in our being unable to open or maintain your account or to provide services to you. While we make every effort to ensure that all information we hold about you is accurate, complete and up to date, you can help us considerably in this regard by promptly notifying us if there are any changes to your personal information. 

**Our Use of Your Personal Information**

  * The use of specialized technology such as firewalls;
  * Testing of the security and operability of products and services before they are introduced to the Internet, as well as on-going scanning for publicly-known vulnerabilities in the technology;
  * Internal and external reviews of our Internet sites and services;
  * Monitoring of our systems infrastructure to detect weaknesses and potential intrusions;
  * Implementing controls to identify, authenticate and authorize access to various systems or sites;
  * Protecting non-public communications through encryption or other means; and 
  * Providing Goldman Sachs personnel with relevant training and continually updating our security practices in light of new risks and developments in technology.   




**Privacy and The Internet**

The following additional information will be of interest to you if you access Goldman Sachs products or services through one or more Goldman Sachs Web sites:

  * Users of private Goldman Sachs Web sites are required to identify and authenticate themselves prior to accessing our services. Generally, identification and authentication take place through the use of your user name and a password, or with an RSA SecurID* Card and a Personal Identification Number ("PIN"). 
  * The private Goldman Sachs Web sites are built upon a secure infrastructure with multiple layers of protection, including measures ranging from proper physical security of our machines to system intrusion detection capabilities. Within such private sites, Goldman Sachs uses industry standard encryption technologies to protect your information from external compromise. 
  * Security is a cooperative effort between Goldman Sachs and the users of the Goldman Sachs Web sites. Please remember that your password, RSA SecurID Card and PIN are personal to you and should not be made available to any other person. Also, you should discontinue their use and notify us if you have any reason to suspect that someone else may be using them.
  * “Cookies” are small text files consisting of information stored by your Web browser. This information is used for administrative purposes and to improve your experience with our Web sites. For example, this information helps authenticate you (i.e., verify that you are who you say you are), an essential component of site security. Cookies also make it easier for you to navigate a Goldman Sachs Web site by, among other things, “remembering” your identity so that you do not have to input your password multiple times as you move between pages or services. You can set your Web browser to inform you when cookies are set, or to prevent cookies from being set. However, if you decline to use cookies, you may experience reduced functionality, and declining to use authentication related cookies will prevent you from using the Web site altogether. 
  * “Clickstream” or similar data (e.g., information regarding which of our Web pages you access, the frequency of such access, and your product and service preferences) may be collected and shared internally within Goldman Sachs in order to assess the usage, value and performance of our online products and services and, if you are a Goldman Sachs client, to suggest products or service offerings that may be of interest to you.

You may, however, in connection with specific products or services offered by Goldman Sachs, be provided with privacy policies or statements that supplement this Policy. This Policy may be changed from time to time to reflect changes in our practices concerning the collection and use of personal information.
