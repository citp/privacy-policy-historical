Privacy Statement

**Privacy Policy and Notice for The Golden 1 Credit Union and Golden 1 Financial Services, Inc.  
Effective January 1, 2003**

The Golden 1 and its affiliate, Golden 1 Financial Services (G1FS), are committed to providing you with financial products and services to meet your needs and to help you reach your financial goals. Protecting the privacy and security of your personal information and ensuring the accuracy of such information is one of our top priorities. Neither Golden 1 nor G1FS sell any of your personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. Although we do disclose that information, as provided below. While either Golden 1 or G1FS may offer products or services on behalf of outside companies, Golden 1 or G1FS controls the information used to make those offers. This Privacy Policy describes how Golden 1 and G1FS collect and use your personal information and how we maintain the confidentiality and accuracy of such information. This policy is provided pursuant to Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the Federal Privacy Act).

**Information That We Collect About You**  
We collect and maintain your information to serve you and administer your business relationship with Golden 1 and G1FS. Specifically, we collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:  


* Information we receive from you on applications or other forms received verbally, electronically, or in writing, including information such as social security numbers, addresses, e-mail addresses, income, assets and debt.  

* Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency, including information we receive from an outside company, such as a credit bureau providing your credit history, credit score or employment verification.  

* Information created as a result of your being a customer of G1FS or your being a Golden 1 member or nonmember joint owner on a deposit or loan account, such as account numbers, PIN codes, and passwords.  

* Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others, including information about your transactions or experiences, such as insurance contracts issued to you, brokerage accounts or relationships you have, or loan or deposit balance histories.  

* Information received from other sources to verify the information that you provide on an application form. This may be obtained from your current or past employers, or from other institutions where you have conducted financial transactions in the past. 

**Information Use and Disclosure Within The Golden 1 and G1FS**  
We may disclose all of the information that we collect, as described above, within Golden 1 or G1FS for a variety of reasons, including the following:  


* To protect the security of your account or business relationship. For example, we use your personal information for identification purposes, to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing your accounts or records with us.  

* To conduct our business in a safe and sound manner. For example, we use information gathered in loan applications to insure that we underwrite loans in a prudent manner consistent with the requirements of credit union regulations.  

* To satisfy legal requirements. For example, we use your social security number for federal income tax reporting purposes.  

* To help us determine which products and services may best serve your needs. Services might be offered by Golden 1 or G1FS, but your nonpublic personal information will always remain in the control of Golden 1 or G1FS making the offer or extending the service and will not be shared except as permitted by law. 

For example, G1FS offers uninsured investment products through a joint marketing arrangement administered by a provider of securities and broker dealer services, but your information is not shared with the third party until you have indicated a desire to receive the services being offered through a variety of delivery channels.

**Information Use and Disclosure With Nonaffiliated Third Parties or Affiliates.**  
When it comes to Golden 1 or G1FS sharing its information with an outside party, we do so only as permitted or required by law and for specific purposes to provide you products and services that you've requested or already have with us. We may disclose all of the information that we collect, as described above. We share this information as needed to provide those products and services and to provide a good member experience. We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to affiliates and to nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law, including the following types of affiliates and third parties:  


* Financial service providers, such as companies that service your loan, provide you an insurance or securities product or relationship, mortgage insurers or payment processing, mortgage bankers, securities brokers-dealers, and insurance agents.  

* Non-financial companies, such as companies that perform services on our behalf, for example check printers, data processing companies that prepare and mail account statements or notices and companies that help us market our own products and services to you.  

* Others, such as independent contractors, including technical system consultants who program our software to help us administer our products or market our own products to you. 

****Information Disclosed to Outside Parties Who Are Service Providers and Financial Institutions With Whom We Have Joint Marketing Agreements****  
We may disclose all of the information we collect from members, as described above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. For example, through a joint marketing arrangement G1FS offers brokerage and securities services from another financial provider Information Disclosed to Outside Parties in Other Situations  
Either the Golden 1 or G1FS might also disclose its own member information to government agencies, consumer-reporting agencies, and other outside parties as permitted or required by the Federal Privacy Act and other applicable laws. These disclosures are made for specific, limited purposes, for instance:  


* To verify individuals' identities (reducing fraud and identity theft).  

* To meet member/customer service expectations (connecting to ATM networks for ATM card access, processing an application for insurance).  

* To verify information for prompt credit approvals (meeting members' immediate financial needs).
