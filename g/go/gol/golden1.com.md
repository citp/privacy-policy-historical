# The Golden 1 Credit Union | Privacy Policy

**Effective January 1, 2008**

We are committed to providing you with financial products and services to meet your needs, and to help you reach your financial goals. Protecting the privacy and security of your personal information, and ensuring the accuracy of such information is one of our top priorities. We do not sell any of your personal information to nonaffiliated third parties, although we do disclose that information, as provided below. We may offer products or services on behalf of outside companies, and we control the information used to make those offers.

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use your personal information and how we maintain the confidentiality and accuracy of such information. This policy is provided pursuant to Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the Federal Privacy Act).

## Information That We Collect About You

We collect and maintain your information to serve you and administer your relationship with us. We collect nonpublic personal information about you from a variety of sources, such as:

  * Information we receive verbally, electronically or in writing from you on applications.
  * Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency.
  * Information about your transactions with others or us.



## Information Use and Disclosure Within the Credit Union

We may disclose all of the information that we collect, as described above, within the credit union for a variety of reasons, including the following:

  * To protect the security of your account or business relationship.
  * To conduct our business in a safe and sound manner.
  * To satisfy legal requirements.
  * To help us best serve your needs, your nonpublic personal information will always remain in our control, and will not be shared except as permitted by law.



## Information Use and Disclosure with Nonaffiliated Third Parties  
or Affiliates

When it comes to us sharing information with an outside party, we do so only as permitted or required by law and for specific purposes to provide you products and services that you have requested or already have with us. We may disclose all of the information that we collect, as previously described.

We share this information, as needed, to provide those products and services and to provide a good member experience. We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to affiliates and to nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law, including the following:

  * Financial service providers, such as companies that service your loan, provide you an insurance or securities product or relationship, mortgage insurers or payment processors, mortgage bankers, securities broker/dealers and insurance agents. 
  * Nonfinancial companies, such as companies that perform services on our behalf. For example, check printers, data processing companies, companies that prepare and mail account statements or notices and companies that help us market our own products to you. 
  * Other companies, such as independent contractors, including technical system consultants who program the software that helps us administer our products or market our products to you.



## Information Disclosed to Outside Parties Who Are Service Providers and Financial Institutions with Whom We Have Joint Marketing Agreements

We may disclose all of the information we collect from members, as previously described, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. For example, through a joint marketing agreement, we offer insurance services from another financial provider.

## Information Disclosed to Outside Parties in Other Situations

We might disclose your information to government agencies, consumer-reporting agencies and other outside parties as permitted or required by the Federal Privacy Act and other applicable laws. These disclosures are made for specific, limited purposes. For example: 

  * To verify individuals' identities (reducing fraud and identity theft).
  * To meet your service expectations (access to ATM or insurance).
  * To protect your accounts or business records against fraud and unauthorized transactions, to resolve disputes, and, as necessary, to our regulators, attorneys, accountants and auditors.



In no event will we share any account number or any access code to any of your credit union accounts or business records with anyone, except as permitted by law.

## Disclosure of Information About Former Members

It is generally unnecessary for us to disclose information about former account owners of the credit union to others that have a relationship with us; however, to the extent we do disclose information, we will adhere to the same policies as previously described.

## How We Protect Your Information

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.

Our employees are trained in the importance of maintaining confidentiality and privacy. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.

## Future Changes
