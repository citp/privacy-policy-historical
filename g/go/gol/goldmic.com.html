That information, along with any other information You may disclose in your posting, can be collected, correlated, and used by third parties, and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Goldmic and are not subject to this Privacy Policy.<br>

Member information is used for internal purposes only, such as market research, improvement of our marketing and promotional efforts, and improvement of our products, services and Site. We do not give, sell, rent, share or trade any identifiable personal information regarding our members to any third party, except as required by law or expressly permitted by a member.                  <br>

Goldmic reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics, either internally or by sending this data to a third party for further analysis. We do this in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of our website and to create tailored marketing offerings. We may share this information with advertisers in aggregated, anonymous form. We may also use this aggregated, anonymous information to let advertisers know how many visitors have seen their banners and how many have clicked on them; advertisers will not be able to identify any individual from these analyses.<br>

              <b>Cookies</b><br>                  
              <br>
              You should be aware that non-personally identifiable information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of Goldmic's web servers or through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small text files a website can use to recognize repeat users. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside of the website that he or she is visiting. Goldmic uses cookies to recognize visitors and more quickly provide personalized content or grant You unimpeded access to registered areas of our website. <br>                  
              <br>
            Information gathered through cookies also helps Us measure use of our Site. Cookie data allows Us to track usage behavior and compile data that We can use to improve the Site and target advertising. This data will generally be used in aggregate form; however, We may track specific users from time to time to help Us improve our products and services. 
            Sometimes, advertisers or third parties hosting data for Goldmic will issue cookies. We cannot control the use of these cookies or the information that they gather.<br>                  
            <br>

            <br> We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that whatever information You provide Us will be maintained in a secure environment.
