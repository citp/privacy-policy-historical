# Golfonline : Privacy and Security

Since we launched in 2000, online privacy has been a priority for us.  It’s changed a lot, but over the years we have found that it is best to do two things.  Make sure that our privacy is in line with the law, and a recognised industry standard.  As such, our privacy policy is in line with both the [Data Protection Act 1998](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents) and the best practices of the [Which? Web Trader Code of Practice](http://www.trustedwebtraders.com/Internet-Code-of-Practice).  Below are the main subjects our customers need information about, but for anything else, please feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us) anytime. 

Cookies

A Cookie is a small file created by your browser and stored on your hard drive. It picks up useful bits of information about your time on our site and makes the experience smoother. For example, at GolfOnline, we use cookies to collect information about which items you are choosing whilst you shop with us, and then we place the information about the products you finally choose into the checkout, ready for you to pay for once you are ready. No other personal information is contained or transmitted in the cookie. If you reject cookies, you will be unable to place orders on the GolfOnline.co.uk website.

Security

When you place your order you are automatically connected to our secure servers using SSL 256 bit encryption. Once you enter the secure site a closed padlock will show in your browser status bar. This means that your personal and card details are fully encrypted, and remain secure across the internet and after they reach our order processing centre.

Site Reporting

We use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to assist us in gathering broad demographic information, like for example, how many visitors we have in each European country. IP addresses are not linked to you or your personally identifiable information.

Passwords

When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected on-line, off-line and in transit. We do not store your actual password. Instead, a system know as MD5 hashing is used to ‘one-way encrypt’ your password, meaning we can only receive a correct password from you, not send your chosen password outwards from us to you or anyone else. Should you lose you password, you can void it and reset it, without worrying about it turning up in any of your mail.

Newsletters

GolfOnline.co.uk sends out regular newsletters with select discounts and offers, as well as exclusive content and product insight in conjunction with leading golfing brands. Typically we send between 1 and 2 newsletters per month to an email address of your choice. This is an opt-in system so after subscribing you will receive a confirmation email; and you can always opt-out by going to your account management section or by simply clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of a newsletter. 

This newsletter is only between us at GolfOnline, and you, our customers and subscribers. As such, we do not sell, or pass on, your information to any third parties. When subscribing to our newsletter we collect the following mandatory information: First Name, Last Name and Email Address. 

We hope you find our information and resources useful. Should you have any questions about this policy, please contact our team at [team@golfonline.co.uk](mailto:team@golfonline.co.uk?subject=Newsletter%20subscription).
