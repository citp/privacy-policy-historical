### What information we collect and how we use it

Golden Tours Ltd. will collect information on you for different purposes outlined below:

  1. **Customers**

Golden Tours Ltd. collects and uses information that you provide to us. When you make a booking with us or with our business partners or alliances for any product(s) that we sell, you are (as a minimum) asked for Name, Email, Contact No, Address, Nationality and Payment information.

While you are getting in touch with our customer service team, to reach us through another avenue such as social media or communicating with your booked product on our site, we also collect information about you from there too. After using our services, customers can be asked to provide a review to help future customers get exactly what they are looking for.

There are also other instances where you will provide us with information. For example, if you’re browsing with your mobile device, you can enable our analytics to see your current location or grant access to your contact details – this helps us provide you with the best possible service. For example, next bus arrival times on our mobile app. You can also open a user account, which allows you to save your personal settings and plan and manage future reservations.

  2. **Other sources**

We may also receive information about you from other sources. These include business partners like affiliate partners and other independent third parties. Any data we receive from them might be combined with information provided by you.

Our affiliates and business partners are allowed to share information about you with Golden Tours Ltd. – this might happen if you have support questions about your pending reservation, when disputes arise about a booking or service, or there's any other communication about your bookings with us.

We use live chat software on our website, this is provided by Click4Assistance, a 3rd party UK based Software Company. Information regarding how the data is processed and stored can be viewed here. <https://www.click4assistance.co.uk/click4assistance-web-chat-software-cookie-policy>
