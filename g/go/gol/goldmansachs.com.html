                          <br>
 This Policy describes the types of personal information we may collect about you, the purposes for which we use the information, the circumstances in which we may share the information, and the steps that we take to safeguard the information to protect your privacy. As used throughout this Policy, the term “Goldman Sachs” refers to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its affiliates worldwide . </p>

                          <br>
                          The personal information we collect about you comes 
                          primarily from the account applications or other forms 
                          and materials you submit to Goldman Sachs during the 
                          course of your relationship with us. We may also collect 
                          information about your transactions and experiences 
                          with Goldman Sachs relating to the products and services 
                          Goldman Sachs provides. In addition, depending on the 
                          products or services you require, Goldman Sachs may 
                          obtain additional information about you, such as your 
                          credit history, from consumer reporting agencies.<br>
                          <br>
                          Finally, in the provision of financial services to you

                          laws and regulations, information may be collected about 
                          you indirectly from monitoring or other means (e.g., 
                          recording of telephone calls and monitoring e-mails). 
                          In these circumstances, the information is not accessed 
                          on a continuous or routine basis but it may be used 
                          for compliance or security purposes. </p>

                          <br>
 The following additional information will be of interest to you if you access Goldman Sachs products or services through one or more Goldman Sachs Web sites:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Users of private Goldman Sachs Web sites are required 
                            to identify and authenticate themselves prior to accessing 
                            our services. Generally, identification and authentication 
                            take place through the use of your user name and a 
                            password, or with an RSA SecurID<sup>*</sup> Card 
                            and a Personal Identification Number ("PIN"). 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                          </li>
                          <li>The private Goldman Sachs Web sites are built upon 
                            a secure infrastructure with multiple layers of protection, 
                            including measures ranging from proper physical security 
                            of our machines to system intrusion detection capabilities. 
                            Within such private sites, Goldman Sachs uses industry 
                            standard encryption technologies to protect your information 
                            from external compromise. <br>
                            <br>
                          </li>
                          <li>Security is a cooperative effort between Goldman 
                            Sachs and the users of the Goldman Sachs Web sites. 
                            Please remember that your password, RSA SecurID Card 
                            and PIN are personal to you and should not be made 
                            available to any other person. Also, you should discontinue 
                            their use and notify us if you have any reason to 
                            suspect that someone else may be using them.<br>

This information is used for administrative purposes and to improve your experience with our Web sites. For example, this information helps authenticate you (i.e., verify that you are who you say you are), an essential component of site security. Cookies also make it easier for you to navigate a Goldman Sachs Web site by, among other things, “remembering” your identity so that you do not have to input your password multiple times as you move between pages or services. You can set your Web browser to inform you when cookies are set, or to prevent cookies from being set. However, if you decline to use cookies, you may experience reduced functionality, and declining to use authentication related cookies will prevent you from using the Web site altogether. <br>
