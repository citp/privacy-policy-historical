#### Personal Information

Your transaction history and the information you provide to us voluntarily on our web site is stored in our customer database along with the customer information received in our catalog phone center and retail superstores. Some of the information we solicit, such as e-mail address, is voluntary, while much of it is required in order to fulfill your order properly. In addition to fulfilling your orders, we use the information that you provide for purposes such as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.

As is common in the catalog business, we may occasionally share your name and postal mailing address with other companies that we have screened carefully for quality and integrity. If you would prefer that we not share your address information with any outside company, please contact our [Customer Service](https://web.archive.org/ps/csemail.php) department. You may also elect not to receive any future catalogs or other mailings from Golfsmith.

Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers online may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed online. We do not make any phone numbers in our customer database available to other companies or organizations.

Any personal information you reveal to us is protected during transmission by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information and is the accepted standard industry-wide for web site security ([click here for more details](https://web.archive.org/ps//display/?page=security)). Our web site presently does not store your credit card information, and any of your credit card information that may be stored in other Golfsmith systems is protected by state-of-the-art firewalls.

#### E-mail Policy

We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, those who make postings to our chat areas, and those who voluntarily include their e-mail addresses when ordering online. We may also collect your e-mail address if you provide it in the process of completing survey information or registering for online contests or sweepstakes. We cannot obtain your e-mail address unless you voluntarily provide it to us, or we obtain it from a service company that has confirmed your willingness to distribute it. Our web server recognizes the computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, but not the e-mail address, for each visitor to our home page.

Contest registrations may involve sharing your e-mail address with our promotional co-sponsors -- please see the specific contest rules & regulations for details. Additionally, if you submit your e-mail address to Golfsmith as part of a transaction originating with one of our e-commerce partners, the e-mail address may be shared by both Golfsmith and the partner; please see the specific privacy policy, accessible from the partner site, for details. 

Other than the exceptions noted above, Golfsmith will not sell, share or otherwise distribute your e-mail address. Any e-mail address supplied directly to Golfsmith with respect to online orders, catalog requests, and requests for other information will remain in the sole possession of Golfsmith.

**If you do not want to receive promotional e-mail from Golfsmith in the future** , please use our [unsubscribe form](https://web.archive.org/ps/unsubscribe.php) to remove your name from our list, or let us know by contacting us by [e-mail](https://web.archive.org/ps/csemail.php), or by calling us at the above telephone numbers and telling us that you do not want to receive promotional e-mail from Golfsmith. Supplied e-mail addresses on our customer registration form will be used for order confirmation and alerts relating to an order.

If you supply us with your postal address online you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please contact us [here](https://web.archive.org/ps/csemail.php) or by calling us at the above telephone numbers.

#### Cookies

Like most retail web sites, we use "cookies," which are pieces of data given to your browser that allow our web site to identify you when you access our site. The most obvious benefit of cookies is that they keep an active Shopping Cart intact for 24 hours even if you log off of your computer. While some concern has been expressed over the privacy implications of cookies, it is important for you to understand that cookies cannot extract any information about you that you have not already revealed voluntarily. The vast majority of Internet users now appreciate cookies as a convenience feature for shopping online. If you desire, the "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
