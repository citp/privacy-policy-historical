## GOLDIEBLOX PRIVACY POLICY

Scope:

This Privacy Policy applies to customer personal information collected by GoldieBlox, Inc., a Delaware corporation, through our family of websites, including [www.goldieblox.com](http://www.goldieblox.com/) and www.bloxtown.com.

  * How and why we collect your personal information.
  * How your information is used and protected.
  * When and with whom we share your information.
  * The choices you can make about how we collect, use, and share your information.



****Information We Collect****

We collect personal information about you to deliver the products and services you request and to help improve your shopping experience. We strive to limit the amount of personal information collected to support the intended purpose of the collection.

****Information You Give Us****

We collect personal information from you in a variety of ways when you interact with GoldieBlox through our websites. Some examples are when you:

Personal information is information that identifies you or is reasonably linked to you. The personal information we collect may include contact and payment information like your name, email and physical addresses, phone numbers, and credit and debit card information.

For certain transactions, we may be required to collect information to comply with legal requirements.

****Information from Other Sources****

We receive and store certain types of information when you interact with our websites, emails, and online advertising. Our purpose is to allow the websites to work correctly, to evaluate use of the website, and to support website analytics and marketing campaigns. Some examples include:

We may collect technical information such as your internet protocol address, your device operating system and browser type, the address of a referring website, if any, and the path you take through our websites.

We use "cookies" to recognize you as you use or return to our sites. This is done so that we can provide a continuous and more personalized shopping experience for you. A cookie is a small text file that a website or email may save to your browser and store on your hard drive.

We may also use web beacons. Beacons allow us to know if a certain page was visited, an email was opened, or if ad banners on our website and other sites were effective.

Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our Users, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser at this time, as we believe that there is no consistent industry standard for how to respond to Do Not Track browser settings.
