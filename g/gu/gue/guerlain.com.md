4\. Your choices regarding cookies

Several options are open to you for managing cookies. Any configuration that you may undertake may amend your Internet browsing and your access conditions to some services which require the use of Cookies. 

You may, at any time, choose to express and amend your wishes in terms of cookies, using the methods described below. 

4.1 Choices offered to you by your browsing software:   
You can configure your browsing software in such a way that the cookies are registered on your Terminal or, on the contrary, so that they are rejected, either automatically, or based on their issuer. You can also configure your browsing software in such a way that you are occasionally given the option to accept or refuse cookies, before a cookie is registered on your terminal. For more information, refer to the “How to exercise your choices, based on the browser you use” section. 

(a) Cookie Agreement   
The registration of a cookie on a terminal is essentially subject to the desires of the Terminal user. The Terminal user may at any time freely express or amend their decisions using the choices offered to them by their browsing software. In your browsing software, if you accept the registration of Cookies on your Terminal, the cookies integrated in pages and content you have consulted may be temporarily stored in a dedicated space on your Terminal. They can only be read by their issuer. 

(b) Cookie Refusal   
If you refuse the registration of cookies on your Terminal, or if you remove cookies which are registered on your terminal, you can no longer use a certain number of functions which are nonetheless necessary in order to browse some parts of our website. This would be the case if you attempted to access our content or services which require identification. This would also be the case if we or our suppliers could not, for technical accounting purposes, recognise the type of browser used by your terminal, its language and display settings or the country from which your Terminal appears to be connected to the Internet. If need be, we will reject any responsibility for the consequences associated with degraded operation of our services resulting from GUERLAIN’ inability to register or consult the cookies necessary for operation that you will have refused or deleted.

4.2 Your choices are expressed online on interprofessional platforms   
Regarding marketing cookies, you can also connect to the Youronlinechoices website, which is offered by digital marketing professionals at the European Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) and is managed in France by the Interactive Advertising Bureau France.   
This means that you can find the companies recorded on this platform which give you the option of refusing or accepting the cookies used by these companies to adapt the adverts which may be displayed on your terminal to your browsing information: <http://www.youronlinechoices.com/fr/controler-ses-cookies/>.   
This European platform is shared by hundreds of Internet marketing professionals and is a centralised interface which allows you to express your refusal or acceptance of cookies which may be used to adapt adverts which may be displayed on your terminal to your terminal browsing. Note that this procedure will not prevent adverts from being displayed on the websites you visit. It will only block technologies which make it possible to adapt adverts to your areas of interest. 

5\. If you share your terminal with other people 

If your terminal is used by several people and if one same terminal has several browsing softwares, we cannot fully guarantee that the services and adverts intended for your Terminal really relate to your own use of this terminal and not the use of another Terminal user. Sharing the use of your Terminal and the cookie configuration of the parameters on your browser with other people is your own choice and responsibility. For more information regarding cookies and their use, you can consult the dossier of the French Data Protection Authority at the following address: [http://www.cnil.fr](http://www.cnil.fr/).
