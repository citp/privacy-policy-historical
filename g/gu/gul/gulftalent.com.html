    <td class="inlineText4" align="left">When you post your resume, GulfTalent automatically creates a registration for you using the email address and password that you supply. When you return to the site in the future you will use that same email address and password to access and edit your existing resume. <br>
      <br>
      GulfTalent recognises that job seekers have different levels of comfort in posting their resume on the internet. To accommodate the needs of all users, GulfTalent offers three levels of privacy from which to choose from. <br>
      <br>
      Standard Posting gives job seekers the most visibility to the broadest employer and/or recruiter audience possible, making the resume including full name and contact details searchable by all third-parties who have subscribed to GulfTalent’s database search service. <br>
      <br>
      Private Posting will allow the resume to be searched, without the name or contact information being displayed. In this case, interested parties can only contact the candidate through GulfTalent. <br>
      <br>
      Hidden Posting allows the user to post his/her resume on GulfTalent without permitting it to be searched by third parties. In this case, the resume can only be viewed by a third-party if the candidate applies for a vacancy advertised by that third-party. <br>
      <br>
      In addition, GulfTalent distinguishes between ‘Employers’ and ‘Recruitment Agencies’ and allows users to specify their desired privacy and visibility options vis-à-vis each group separately. </td>
