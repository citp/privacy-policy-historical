**Cookies**   
When you interact with the Site, we try to make that experience simple and meaningful. When you visit our Site, our Web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to indicate whether you have visited the Site previously. A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to store in a Web browser so that it can later be read back from that browser. Our Site uses cookies to keep track of a user's session.

**Choices about Cookies**  
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) 

We use cookies for a number of purposes, including to: access your account information when you "sign in," so that we can provide you with customized content; keep track of preferences you specify while you are using our Site and report our total audience size and traffic, and conduct research to improve our services to you. 

In order to make GulfBase.com a more valuable service for our subscribers and visitors, we may also collect and analyze statistical information. From time to time, we share this information in aggregate with a third party. However, this data is reported only in aggregate and reveals no personal details about individual visitors to our site. This information is distributed only to help attract appropriate advertisers for GulfBase.com site. 

**Advertisers**   
We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. This privacy policy only governs the use of cookies by www.gulfbase.com 

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**   
Our third party advertising partners may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. 

**Registration Forms**   
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name, company name, email and postal address), and unique identifiers (like their user name). We also collect financial information at this point such as your credit card number, when you sign up for “Premium Membership” to service your request and complete your subscription request. 

Contact information from the registration forms is used to complete your subscription request, and to deliver information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary such as in delivery of service requests, notifications or alerts that you have requested. These communications are generally not promotional in nature and you cannot opt-out of them. 

**Order Forms**   
Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect contact information (like their name, company name, email and postal address), and unique identifiers (like their user name). 

Contact information from the order forms are used to deliver orders, and information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to send promotional material from some of our partners to our customers, and to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

Unique identifiers (such as user names) are collected from Web site visitors to verify the user's identity and for use as account references in our record system.
