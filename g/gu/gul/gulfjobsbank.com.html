<p>The privacy of our visitors to
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.gulfjobsbank.com/">
www.gulfjobsbank.com</a> is important to us.</p>
<p>At
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.gulfjobsbank.com/">
www.gulfjobsbank.com</a>, we recognize that privacy of your personal information 
is important. Here is information on what types of personal information we 
receive and collect when you use and visit
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.gulfjobsbank.com/">
www.gulfjobsbank.com</a>, and how we safeguard your information.&nbsp; We never sell 
your personal information to third parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font color="#008080" size="4">As a career site,</font></b>
<a href="http://www.gulfjobsbank.com">www.gulfjobsbank.com</a>&nbsp; will ask 
jobseekers and employers to submit any information relevant to the job/candidate 
search in order to conduct/optimize the search functionality. All information is 
submitted exclusively on a voluntary basis. Please find below details of our 
member privacy practices.<br>
Registration<br>
<br>
<br>
To fully participate in our job and candidate databases or search activities, we 
require you to register as a GULFJOBSBANK member. Non-registered users are 
granted partial participation access eg. non-registered jobseekers may view 
positions but not company contact information.</p>
<p><br>
To register, we will ask for contact information (jobseekers and employers) and 
information on your company (employers). GULFJOBSBANK is the sole owner of 
information collected on the registration pages and we will not disclose this 
information to anyone outside of GULFJOBSBANK. Your contact information (such as 
name and email address may however be used to contact you about any 
features/services on our site which we believe may be of interest. Our goal is 
to provide our users with a personalized experience every time they log onto 
GULFJOBSBANK and to that end we may direct you to jobs/articles/forums etc. that 
we think may assist you in your career/lifestyle engineering activities.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#008080" size="4">Resumes</font></b><br>
<br>
<br>
Members can feed their CVs in CV Builder Form thru the GULFJOBSBANK.COM and the 
ACTIVE mode may be specified. This would enable any employer members who is 
registered with our service to access your CV. We are not responsible for the 
privacy of any copies of your CV that are subsequently retained by employer 
members in their own private files and databases. <br>
<br>
<br>
As an additional privacy function, jobseekers have the option to block the name 
of their current employer from any employer searches. This function is easily 
available on our CV Builder. Your CV will therefore appear in candidate searches 
with your latest experience record but without details of your current employer. 
This is a critical feature as the last person you would like viewing your CV is 
your current employer.<br>
You may edit/change information on your CV at any point in time. You may also 
remove your CVs from our databases at any point in time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" color="#008080">Job Postings</font></b><font size="4"><br>
</font><br>
<br>
Employers are asked to submit detailed contact information and information about 
the position requirements as part of their job posting activity. Information is 
submitted purely voluntarily. Job details may be viewed by any registered 
jobseeker members. Non-members may view position but do not have access to 
contact details; they must register first to be able to contact your company. As 
an additional privacy feature, employers may hide their company name when their 
jobs are viewed online. Your privacy will thus be assured while jobseekers have 
the option to reply to the posting.<br>
You may change/modify/delete any information you provide at any point in time.<br>
Your Workspace<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Registered jobseekers and employers have access to a personal workspace from 
where they can manage/document their job/candidate search history. All 
information in this space can only be viewed by the registered user(s) and 
accessed after logging in with your password.<br>
<br>

<p><br>
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when 
you visit our site.&nbsp; This could include only showing you a popup once in your 
visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.</p>
<p>We also use third party advertisements on
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.gulfjobsbank.com/">
www.gulfjobsbank.com</a> to support our site.&nbsp; Some of these advertisers may use

which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google 
AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser 
you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash 
installed.&nbsp; This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York 
real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads 
based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who 
frequents cooking sites).</p>

using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements).&nbsp; 
This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest

browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las 
Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related 
site, such as on a site about hockey).&nbsp; DART uses “non personally identifiable 
information”.&nbsp; It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your 
name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security 
numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.&nbsp; You can opt-out of this

with our site as well as other websites.&nbsp; This could include the inability to 
login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.</p>
<p>Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any 
advertising program.&nbsp; Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next 
time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.</p>
