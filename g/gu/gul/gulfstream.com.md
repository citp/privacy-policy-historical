This Privacy Policy applies to the Gulfstream.com website, the MyGulfstream.com website, and all Gulfstream web pages accessed by you with your MyGulfstream.com login credentials (each individually a “Site,” and collectively the “Sites”). In addition to this Privacy Policy, some Sites may have individual privacy policies specific to use of that Site, which may include different privacy practices than those described in this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review any such Site-specific policies upon accessing the Sites. To the extent any such Site-specific policy is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, the Site-specific policy controls.

  * Information Collected
  * Use of Collected Information
  * Links to Other Sites
  * Security of Collected Information
  * Access to Collected Information
  * Children
  * Email Opt-Out
  * International Use

### Information Collected

Our web servers seek (as many websites do) to place a "cookie" (a small data file) on your computer or mobile device which allows the server to recognize the computer or device when it visits the Site again. Cookies are used to track statistical information about navigation to and throughout certain areas of our Sites, and to track Gulfstream promotions on other sites (as discussed further below). This cookie is not used to obtain your name or any personal data, and the information that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve site navigation and to measure the effectiveness of our promotional placements, and is not shared with anyone other than Gulfstream affiliates and contractors who assist Gulfstream in these efforts and are usually bound to confidentiality. However, if you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your browser to reject them or to alert you before one is placed. Please note that if you choose to disable cookies, our Sites may function differently.

When you use, register and/or sign in to our Sites, you are not anonymous to us. We may collect information from your computer, device and/or browser including your IP address, geolocation data, software and hardware attributes, your use of the Sites, and other Site performance data. We use this information to improve our services and provide reporting for internal purposes.

We also use a third-party technology to place our advertisements on Gulfstream websites as well as other websites. This technology will install a small cookie on your computer or device when you view our ad. These cookies will not contain any information that personally identifies you (such as your name or e-mail address) but they will contain a randomly generated number that is unique to your browser and can be recognized by a "Web beacon" (transparent GIF file) on our Site if you click through to our Site from one of our ads. This allows us to keep track of how many unique visitors we have to our Sites and from what ads they entered, so that we can measure the effectiveness of our ads and ad placements. The privacy policies of the third-party websites on which we advertise, and through which the cookies are installed, should inform you about the cookie, and you may of course set your browser to reject cookies as noted above.

In addition, we may need to collect personal information from you for a specific purpose, such as to provide you with certain information or services that you request. The information collected from you may include your name, address, telephone, fax number, or e-mail address, details regarding your Gulfstream aircraft and your aircraft maintenance program, and other details regarding your business relationship with us. For example, signing up for or using a MyGulfstream account will require some of these types of personal information.

When you make a purchase on our Sites, your credit card number and credit card identification number (“CCID”) will be processed by a third-party payment processor and will be used by that third-party payment processor for purposes of processing and verifying the transaction. Such third-party payment processor will store the credit card number and a “token” that facilitates the transaction, but it will not store your CCID. We will not store your credit card number or CCID. We only store a “token” that facilitates the transaction, as well as your name, address, and credit card expiration date.

We may collect data regarding aircraft maintenance, safety, and performance. To the extent such data is personally identifying, we will only disclose that data: (1) as necessary to comply with requests from government agencies and regulators, including but not limited to the Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board; and (2) to Gulfstream’s employees, contractors, agents, and service providers in connection with providing products and services to you, or to monitor and improve the use and quality of Gulfstream’s products and services.

Finally, Gulfstream may collect non-personally-identifying data, including, but not limited to, data you input on the Sites or share with Gulfstream. Gulfstream may use and distribute any such data at its discretion.

### Use of Collected Information

We may track use of the Sites on an individual user account basis with respect to devices used for accessing the Sites and the times at which certain of the Sites features were used. Other information that we collect on the Sites is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Site, pages viewed, Site performance, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our Sites and to improve the content of our Sites, and to measure the effectiveness of our communications. In addition, such data may be made available to our third-party service providers on an anonymized and aggregated basis to perform services for us relating to the Sites, including for purposes of creating statistical reports and analyses regarding the Sites.

When other information is collected from you, such as your name and e-mail address, we generally let you know at the time of collection how we will use the personal information. Usually, we use the personal information you provide only to respond to your inquiry or to process your request. This information may be shared with other Gulfstream businesses, but only if necessary to fulfill your request or for related purposes.

We may share the personal information you provide with other companies we have hired to provide services for us. These companies - our vendors/suppliers - are usually contractually bound to use personal information we share with them only to perform the services we have hired them to provide. We do not share, sell, or lease personal information about you to any third-parties for their marketing use. We will release information about you if you direct us to do so, if we are required by law to do so, or in other legally limited circumstances (for example, to protect your account from fraud or to enforce our [Terms of Use](http://www.gulfstream.com/legal/terms-of-use). In addition, if all or a part of our company is sold, we may transfer or replicate some or all of the personal information we have to the buyer.

### Links to Third-Party Sites

The Sites may contain links to third-party sites such as Gulfstream suppliers and affiliates, and we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by such third-party sites.

### Security of Collected Information

We maintain physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized or inappropriate access. We restrict access to information about you to those Gulfstream workers who need to know the information to respond to your inquiry or request. Workers who misuse personal information are subject to potential disciplinary action. It is important to note that no method of safeguarding information is 100% secure. While we try to ensure the protection of your personal information, we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will be effective or sufficient.

### Access to Collected Information

You may review and update the information that you provide to us through the Sites by contacting us as described below.

### Children

The Sites are not intended for children under the age of 13, and children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the Sites.

### Email Opt-Out

If you no longer wish to receive email communications from us, you can follow the specific unsubscribe instructions in the email you receive, or contact us at the address below. You may also be able to customize the emails you receive from us through preferences in your MyGulfstream account if you have registered for such an account. If you do business with us, you may not opt out of automated notifications based on business transactions (e.g. e-commerce).

### International Use

Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or where we have engaged a service provider, and by your use of the Sites you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including to the United States, which may have different data protection rules than in your country.

### Do Not Track

We do not track customers over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore the Sites do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.

### Changes to our Privacy Policy

We may from time-to-time update our Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our services and policies. When we update the Privacy Policy, we will revise the “Effective” date listed at the top of this page. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy and any Site-specific policies for Sites that you use.

### Contacting Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us. We welcome your questions and suggestions about our Privacy Policy.
