**2\. PRIVACY NOTICE ADDENDA**

This Privacy Notice describes the processing activities common to the Services. Certain Services may process additional personal data, or may involve other processing activities. Consult the applicable "Privacy Notice Addendum" (each an " **Addendum** ," collectively " **Addenda** ") for each Service for more information about such activities. In the event of a conflict or discrepancy between this Privacy Notice and any Addendum for a given Service, the Addendum shall control.

**3\. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

We collect a variety of personal data from and about you through the Services, including:

  * When you provide it to us directly;
  * Automatically through logging and analytics tools, cookies, and as a result of your use of and access to the Services; and
  * From third-party sources, including from app stores; service providers such as payment processors, aircraft maintenance providers, and analytics providers; and through your interactions with us on social media websites.



You have choices about certain information we collect. When you are asked to provide information, you may decline to do so; but if you choose not to provide information that is necessary to provide any aspect of our Services, you may not be able to use those Services. In addition, as noted below in the section captioned " **YOUR CHOICES** ", it is possible to change your browser settings to block the automatic collection of certain information.

Finally, we may collect data that is not identifiable to you or otherwise associated with you, such as aggregated data, and is not personal data. To the extent this data is stored or associated with personal data, it will be treated as personal data; otherwise, the data is not subject to this notice.

**Information You Share With Us.** We collect personal data from you when you provide it to us, including through website forms; when you request or provide information to create a MyGulfstream account; ordering or purchasing goods, support, or services; interacting with us on social media, or contacting us with questions or comments.

For example, if you order products and/or services from us directly through the Services, you must provide us with information to process that request, including but not limited to email address, first and last name, billing address, shipping address (if applicable), payment information, and any other information you may optionally provide, such as telephone number or aircraft tail number.

If you request a MyGulfstream account for yourself or your organization, you will need to provide us with certain information about yourself and, in certain circumstances, information about others in your organization, including name, title, email address, telephone number, postal address, username and password, information about aircraft you have responsibility for (which may include registration or serial number), role within the organization, and other information you may optionally provide such as birthday, nickname, and other comments.

If you contact us with questions, requests, or concerns, or to exercise your legal rights, we collect personal data sufficient to answer your questions, address your requests, and/or handle your concerns, as applicable. In certain situations, we may also require you to provide personal data to authenticate your identity in order to carry out your requests.

We also collect information from you that, depending on applicable law, may not constitute personal data.

**Information Collected Automatically.** When you browse or use the Services, we utilize commonly-used logging and analytics tools, including Google Analytics (and, for our mobile applications, AppSee), to collect information about your device, the network used to access the Services, and information about your use of the Services (such as how you navigate and move around the Services).

We also use certain technologies on the Services, including cookies and pixel tags, that allow us, our service providers, and other third parties to store information locally on your device, identify your device, track your interactions with other sites or with our email campaigns, and track activity over time and across websites.

Information collected automatically includes the software and hardware attributes of the device you use to access the Services, unique device ID information, regional and language settings, performance data about the Services, network provider, and IP address (a number assigned to your device when you use the Internet). In addition, information is collected passively in the form of log files and third-party analytics that record activity on websites and mobile applications. For example, log file entries and analytics data are generated every time you visit a particular page on our website, and track the dates and times that you use the Services, the pages you visit, the amount of time spent on specific pages, and other similar usage information, and general data (including the name of the web page from which you entered our website).

  * _Location Information:_ If you permit certain Services (such as our mobile applications) to access information about your location (including global positioning system (" **GPS** ") or general location information derived from the network you use to access the Services), we collect the precise or general location information provided by your device for the purposes listed in the Addenda for those Services. See the " **YOUR CHOICES** " section below for more information about how to disable or limit the collection of GPS data.
  * _Cookies, Web Tracking, and Advertising._ We use cookies and pixel tags to personalize and enhance your experience in regard to our Services, to collect data about your visit to our Services, to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer the Services, to evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising campaigns, to permit analytics providers to gather information about your visit to the Services, and to gather broad demographic information about our users.
  * Please see our [Cookie Notice](https://web.archive.org/legal/cookie-notice) and the " **YOUR CHOICES** " section of this Privacy Notice for more information about cookies and other web tracking technologies on the Services; for information about how you can reject, delete, or prevent cookies from being placed on your system; and how you can opt out of, limit, or prevent certain web tracking technologies and/or advertising providers from collecting information about you.



**Information Obtained from Third Parties.** We receive personal data from third parties that we have engaged to provide services to us and to you, including payment processors, providers of aircraft maintenance services, as well as from third parties that provide web and application analytics and usage information to us such as Google Analytics. We may also obtain personal data when you request that third parties provide it to us and from government and/or regulatory records, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (" **FAA** ") Registry.

In addition, if you choose to interact with us or our partners on social media by posting to our pages, tagging us (or using certain hashtags or other identifiers) in posts, or participating in activities, we may collect certain information from the social media account you use to interact with us, including the name associated with the account, the account handle, recent activity, the content of any posts in which we are tagged, and other information that may be contained on your social media profile to allow us to respond to the posts and understand and engage with our audience.

For the purposes of this Privacy Notice, "partners" means affiliates, service providers, licensors, vendors, manufacturers, distributors, or other third parties with which we have a business relationship.

**4\. HOW DO WE PROCESS PERSONAL DATA?**

We process personal data for two general purposes, pursuant to various legal bases:

  * For our business operations (including communicating with you, fulfilling orders, providing information about our products and services, improving the Services, and complying with applicable legal requirements); and
  * To market and promote our, and our partners’, products and offerings.



We disclose personal data to our service providers to allow them to provide services to us and assist in carrying out your requests.

In addition, we may disclose information we maintain, including personal data: when permitted or required to do so by law; in response to a request from a law enforcement agency or authority or any regulatory authority; and/or to protect the integrity of the Services or our interests, rights, property, or safety, and/or that of our users and others.

See the " **YOUR CHOICES** " section below for information about how you can make decisions about how we process personal data, including how to opt out of certain marketing communications.

**_Legal Bases for Processing._** We process personal data for, or based on, one or more of the following legal bases:

  * **Performance of a Contract.** We may use personal data to enter into, or perform under, the agreement between us, including processing payment and billing information as part of a purchase or sale, to conduct due diligence on customers and potential customers, and providing customer service and support.
  * **Legitimate Interests.** We may use personal data for our legitimate interests, including improving service; providing information about our products and/or services; to the extent necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring the security of our premises, network, and information; and for administrative, fraud detection, and legal compliance purposes.
  * **Compliance with Legal Obligations and Protection of Individuals.** We may use personal data to comply with the law and our legal obligations, as well as to protect you and other individuals from certain harms.
  * **Your Consent.** We process certain personal data because you have given us your consent to process it in that manner.



**_Operational Uses._** We process your personal data as part of our operations, which include:

  * Providing you with information tailored to your requests, responding to inquiries, and delivering services and products;
  * Operating, maintaining, and improving the quality of the Services and such content, products and/or services as we may make available through the Services;
  * Communicating with you by email, mail, telephone, push notification, and other methods of communication, in each case with your consent, if such consent is required in accordance with applicable laws, about products, services, order status, and other topics;
  * Compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules and requests of relevant law enforcement and/or other governmental agencies;
  * Endeavoring to protect our and our partners’ rights, property, or safety, and the rights, property, and safety of our users and other third parties; and
  * For other purposes, as permitted or required by law.



**_Marketing Uses._** We process your personal data to send messages to you about us, our partners, and the products and services we and our partners offer, which may from time to time include contests, rewards, events, and special offers for products and services. These communications are tailored based on the communications preferences you select when providing us with your information and will only occur with your prior consent, if such consent is required in accordance with applicable laws. We process personal data collected through social media platforms and web tracking technologies to market to and understand our audience.

**_Sharing of Personal Data._** Some of the above processing involves sharing collected personal data with third parties, including service providers, affiliates, and other partners.

  * We share personal data with third parties when you ask us to do so;
  * We share personal data among our affiliated entities;
  * We share personal data with our service providers, including those that provide aircraft support services such as maintenance and scheduling; payment processors; software and Web developers, customer relations management (CRM) services; communications services; order processing and fulfillment services; commercial mail/email providers; security consultants; data hosting services; and other vendors we engage so that they may provide services to you, to us, or on our behalf; and
  * We share personal data with third parties when we believe it is required by, or necessary to comply with, applicable law.



**5\. PROTECTING PERSONAL DATA**

We employ reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to promote the security of our systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of personal data. Those safeguards include: (i) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data where we deem appropriate; (ii) taking steps to ensure personal data is backed up and remains available in the event of a security incident; and (iii) periodic testing, assessment, and evaluation of the effectiveness of our safeguards.

However, no method of safeguarding information is completely secure. While we use measures designed to protect personal data, we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will be effective or sufficient. In addition, you should be aware that Internet data transmission is not always secure, and we cannot warrant that information you transmit utilizing the Services is or will be secure.

**6\. RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA.**

We retain personal data for a period of time depending on the type and sensitivity of the personal data, the purpose for which it is processed, and to the extent we deem necessary to carry out the processing activities described above, including but not limited to compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules and requests of relevant law enforcement and/or other governmental agencies, and to the extent we reasonably deem necessary to protect our and our partners’ rights, property, or safety, and the rights, property, and safety of our users and other third parties. We consider multiple factors, including legal requirements, the scope and nature of the personal data, and potential risk of harm to data subjects from a data breach, in determining the appropriate retention period.

For example, we generally retain personal data about our customers for the duration of the customer relationship plus a number of years afterwards that depends on the sensitivity of the information and the purpose for which it is processed (for example, personal data processed for the purposes of ensuring security of Gulfstream facilities during customer visits is held for a shorter period of time than personal data processed as part of customer service or sales contract activities).

If you have a specific question regarding retention of your personal data, you may contact us as described in the " **Additional Information and Assistance** " section below.

**7\. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING PERSONAL DATA**

You have a variety of legal rights regarding the collection and processing of personal data. You may exercise these rights, to the extent they apply to you, by contacting us at [data.privacy@gulfstream.com](mailto:data.privacy@gulfstream.com), as provided at the end of this Privacy Notice, or by following instructions provided in this Privacy Notice or in communications sent to you.
