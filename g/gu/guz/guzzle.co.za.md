**YOUR INFORMATION**   
Guzzle will only use your information to notify you of updates on specials. When you sign up for a Guzzle account, all information including names, email address and contact numbers will be stored in our secure database. 

We value your privacy!  
Guzzle will never divulge any of your information to third parties. 

**EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS**   
We will only use your email address to communicate with you regarding new specials, based on alerts that you have explicitly added. You can add, update and delete these alerts at any time. 

**COOKIES**   
Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer’s hard drive (if your Web browser permits). This website sets up basic cookies after placing an enquiry so that, should you place subsequent enquiries, parts of your information are automatically completed for you to avoid unnecessary re-entering of this information. This website also uses cookies from third party vendors for website analysis (Google Analytics) and conversion tracking (Google Adwords). This information is presented to us in an (anonymous) aggregated form and only used to measure the effectiveness of our advertising, as well as to measure user response to our website. Both come down to providing you, our guest, with the most useful and informative browsing experience.
