                      WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
   Why?               Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives consumers the
                      right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share, and
                      protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do.
   What?              The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you have with us.

                            credit history and credit scores
                      When you are no longer our customer, we continue to share your information as described in this notice.
   How?               All financial companies need to share customers’ personal information to run their everyday business. In

                      the reasons Guild Mortgage Company chooses to share; and whether you can limit this sharing.
