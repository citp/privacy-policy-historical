<h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>

<p>Songsterr.com will collect members submitted information such as name and email address in order to authenticate a member and to communicate with that member about our services.</p>

<p>Songsterr.com may also choose to log non-personal identifiable data including your IP address, account information, user data, and browser type, from all members and visitors to the site. This data collection is used to assist us in managing the website, track the usage and improve our services. This non-personal identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members.</p>

<p>Email addresses are used on the site for the purposes of sending updates, newsletters or general news regarding the website services. With the exception of these uses, a user’s email address is not shared or displayed within users. Users may choose to opt out of receiving emails of this type by changing their account settings.</p>

<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website.

<h2>Your Financial Information</h2>

<p>Songsterr.com is designed to provide a safe and secure environment for making payments. When you subscribe to Songsterr Plus account, our systems redirects your browser software on your computer to establish a secure, encrypted connection using an Internet-standard technology called SSL with a third-party payment processing system. This encrypted connection prevents information from being intercepted as it travels the Internet between our systems. You can verify that you are viewing a secure web page by checking your browser’s lock icon — on a secure page the lock will appear in the “locked” position.</p><p>

</p><p>Your credit card information is sent through a secure connection to third-party credit card processor directly and is never retained on our servers.</p>

<p>If for any reason these systems fail and unauthorized charges are made to your account, the Fair Credit Billing Act stipulates that your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. This protection applies only to credit cards (not debit cards) issued under the laws of the United States of America. Credit cards issued in other countries may afford similar protection.</p>

We take reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within our databases, and there is restricted access to member information to only those employees who need access, such as our customer service and technical staff.
