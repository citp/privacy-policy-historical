**Safeguarding Your Personal Information**

Guitartabs.cc cares about the security of your Personal Information. We follow generally accepted industry security standards to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use such Personal Information. Despite many advances in information security technology and procedures, however, no commercially deployed method of information transfer over the Internet or electronic data storage is known to be 100% secure. As a result, while we do strive to use modern and commercially reasonable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its transmission or its storage in our systems. 

**International Operations and Transfers Out of Switzerland and the EEA**

Guitartabs.cc is a worldwide service. By using our Site, you authorize us to transfer and store your information outside your home country, including in the United States, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your information in these countries may not be the same as in your home country. 

We take additional measures when information is transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA). This includes having standard clauses approved by the European Commission in our contracts with parties that receive information outside the EEA. We also rely on European Commission adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers to countries outside the EEA. 

**For Parents Concerning the Privacy of Information on Their Children**

We are a general audience Site that does not knowingly collect data from children under 13 years of age. Currently, we do not collect any age-specific data on our Site.

**Cookies**

A "cookie" is a small text file that an Internet site can place on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make using this Site easier by, among other things, saving your preferences for you and to help identify you whenever you return to our Site. Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent (note: you may need to consult your browser's "Help" area for instructions on how to do that). 

Some of our Site's pages may contain electronic images (called "Clear GIFs", "Single-Pixel GIFs", or "Web Beacons") that allow us to count page views or to access cookies. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a Clear GIF. Typically, though, Clear GIFs are very small (1-by-1 pixel size) files. They are often invisible on a web page, but their presence can be detected within many Internet browsers by setting your browser to view web page "sources". Clear GIFs are so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content. We may also include Clear GIFs in our email correspondence in order to determine information about the opening and reading of such emails. In addition, some advertising networks that serve ads on our web Site may occasionally use Clear GIFs within banner advertisements. Clear GIFs set by Guitartabs.cc generally are not used to collect, gather, monitor, or share personal information about our users, though they can be used in conjunction with cookies to record particular actions. We use Clear GIFs primarily to compile aggregated, anonymous statistics about the Site or email usage. 

**Links to Other Sites**

We may have links to third-party-operated sites that sell or license certain music-related services, videos, or other goods mentioned, provided, or promoted on Guitartabs.cc. Unless a site is within the Guitartabs.cc domain (as generally indicated by a web address beginning with www.Guitartabs.cc), it is not operated or controlled by Guitartabs.cc, and any transactions that you may enter into with such sites will be subject to the privacy and security practices of the merchant with which you are transacting. **Guitartabs.cc, its parent company, affiliates, and agents are not responsible for the privacy and security practices of sites not in our immediate control.** You should not assume that their privacy policies or practices are the same as those followed by our company or by other Guitartabs.cc-related companies. Visitors to any such web sites should refer to their respective privacy policies and practices.

If you have any questions or complaints about our Privacy Policy, you can contact our customer service department at [privacy@guitartabs.cc](mailto:privacy@guitartabs.cc). When we receive such inquiries about our Privacy Policy, we will use the Personal Information (such as your name and email address) only to respond to your question or comment. However, if your question raises one or more issues that affect our promotional partners, we may also share your question with them in order to provide a response. 

**Obligations to Data Protection Authorities**

We will respond diligently and appropriately to requests from DPAs about this Policy or compliance with applicable data protection privacy laws and regulations. We will, upon request, provide DPAs with names and contact details of the individuals designated to handle this process. With regard to transfers of personal information, we will (i) cooperate with inquiries from the DPA responsible for the entity exporting the data and (ii) respect its decisions, consistent with applicable law and due process rights. With regard to transfers of data to third-parties, we will comply with DPAs decisions relating to it and cooperate with all DPAs in accordance with applicable legislation.

We reserve the right to modify, alter or otherwise update this Privacy Policy at any time. When we make changes that we consider material in our privacy practices, we will notify you in this space. So, we encourage you to review this page from time-to-time. We may also attempt to notify you of any such material changes to our privacy practices via email or by placing a notice on our home page.
