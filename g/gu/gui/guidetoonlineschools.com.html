<p><a name="_DV_M9"></a>1. <i>Information You Provide to Us</i>.</p>

<p>The Site may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply while on the Site and/or use the Service.  Specifically, but not exclusively, we collect personal information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, and other information relevant to particular products or services that you choose to enter into one of the Service's forms.  If you decline to supply or provide the Site with certain information while using the Service, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Service or by the Company.</p>

<p>The Site also collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the Site and use the Service.  For example, to enhance your experience on the Site, the Site uses a standard feature found in browser software called a 
"cookie."&nbsp; Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us track user trends and patterns.  Other examples of information that the Site may collect as you navigate it include, but are not limited to, date and time of visit, referring URL address (location from which a visitor comes to the Site), type of Internet browser, and visitor's IP address.  This information allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the Site.</p>

<p>Cookie data is linked to personally identifiable information for the purposes of data analysis and quality control.  However, data from individual cookies will never be shared with or sold to third parties.</p>

<p>3. <i>Merging of Information.</i></p>

<p>Information collected through the Site may be merged with information collected from other sources, including offline sources.  Similarly, information collected through the Site may be stored with information collected from other sources, including offline sources.</p>
