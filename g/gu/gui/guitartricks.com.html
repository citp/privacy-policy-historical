<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="about-post">
<b>PRIVACY POLICY EFFECTIVE DATE: April 11th 2016</b>
<p>
1. INTRODUCTION. GUITAR TRICKS INC. (“us,” “we,” or “Company”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the Company Website (“the Site”) and Applications (“the Apps”), together referred to herein as “Services). We created this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to give you confidence as you visit and use the Services and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Services, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Services, each of which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
1.1. NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN
PLEASE NOTE: Our Services are intended for a general audience, and we do not direct any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age. We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children’s privacy online. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user of our Services is under age 13, we will promptly delete any personal information in that user’s account.
</p>
<p>
2. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES
</p>
<p>
2.1. TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED
</p>
<p>
(a) TRAFFIC DATA COLLECTED. We automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit our Services: (1) IP addresses; (2) domain servers; (3) types of computers accessing the Services; and (4) types of web browsers used to access the Services (collectively “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving your experience on the Services. We also use “cookies” to customize content specific to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, and to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Services.
</p>
<p>
(b) PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED. In order for you to access certain premium, services and to purchase products that we offer via our Services, we require you to provide us with certain information that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information includes the following categories of information: (1) Contact Data (such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and, if you call our “Call for Guitar Help” service, your phone number); (2) Financial Data (such as your account or credit card number, your Paypal email address, or your billing address); and (3) Demographic Data (such as your zip code, age, and income). If you communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards, or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, or contest entries, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information. If you choose to participate in one of our optional marketing research surveys, the demographic information asked for (e.g., name, age, gender, and income level) will be collected and retained by us for marketing purposes as described below (see Section 2.2(a))
</p>
<p>
2.2. USES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED
</p>
<p>
(a) COMPANY USE OF INFORMATION. We use Contact Data to send you information about our company or our products or services, or promotional material from some of our partners, or to contact you when necessary. We use your Financial Data to verify your qualifications for certain products or services and to bill you for products and services. We use your Demographic Data to customize and tailor your experience on the Services, such as displaying content that we think you might be interested in according to demographic data and your expressed preferences.
</p>
<p>
(b) SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. We share certain categories of information we collect from you in the ways described in this Privacy Policy. We share Demographic Data with advertisers and other third parties only on an aggregate (i.e., non-personally-identifiable) basis. We share Contact Data with other companies who may want to send you information about their products or services, unless you have specifically requested that we not share Contact Data with such companies. We also share Contact Data and Financial Data with our business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to our operation of the Services. Those business partners have all agreed to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal Information to carry out their specific business obligations to Company. If you do not want us to share your Contact Data with any third parties, please email us at admin@guitartricks.com or select the “opt out” box on our online forms, but please understand that such a request will likely limit your ability to take advantage of all of the features and services we offer on the Services.
