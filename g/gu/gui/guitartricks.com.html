      <p align="left">Guitar Tricks has created this privacy statement in order to 
      demonstrate our community's firm commitment to the privacy of our 
      visitors. (Visitors are also referred to as "users" interchangeably in 
      this policy.) The following discloses our information gathering and 
      dissemination practices for guitartricks.com&nbsp;(referred to as "our 
      site" in this policy). <br><br><strong>Information Automatically Logged </strong>   <br>We 
      utilize the IP address of our visitors to help diagnose problems with our 
      server and to administer our Web site. The IP address is employed to help 
      identify the user and to gather broad demographic information. 
      <br><br><strong>Cookies <br></strong>Our site does not use cookies. </p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Contribution&nbsp;Forms </strong><br>  
                
              Our site's&nbsp;contribution form 
      asks visitors to provide contact information (like their name and email 
      address). We use contact information gathered from the registration form to 
      contact the visitor when necessary and may be shared with other companies 
      who want to contact the visitor. Visitors may opt-out of receiving future 
      mailings (see the "choice/opt-out" section below). Demographic and profile 
      data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the user's 
      experience at our site, showing them content that we think will interest 
      them and displaying the content according to their preferences. This 
      information may be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. </p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Surveys <br></strong>Our online surveys ask visitors 
      for contact information (like their email address) and demographic 
      information (like their zip code and age). We use aggregate data from our 
      surveys to learn demographic information about our users. The visitor's 
      contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary and 
      may be shared with other companies for the purposes of contacting our 
      visitors. <br><br><strong>External Links </strong><br>This site contains 
      links to other sites. Guitar Tricks is not responsible for the privacy 
      practices or the content of such Web sites. <br><br><strong>Advertisers 
      </strong><br>We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. 
      These ads may contain cookies. While we don't use cookies in other parts 
      of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad 
      company, and we do not have access to this information. Some customer data 
      may be shared with the advertising companies. </p>

      measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the
