<p>8. DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION. If Company becomes aware of a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction,
loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Customer Data or Personal Data while processed by Company
(each a “Security Incident”), Company will promptly and without undue delay (1) notify Customer of the Security Incident;
(2) investigate the Security Incident and provide Customer with detailed information about the Security Incident; (3)
take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the Security Incident. With respect
to breach of Personal Data of citizens of the EU, Company shall comply with GDPR requirements and take immediate steps
to notify the supervisory authority “without undue delay” and within 72 hours of discovering the breach, where feasible.
Company’s obligation to report or respond to a Security Incident under this section is not an acknowledgement by Company
of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p>9. CUSTOMER’S CHOICES REGARDING USE OF INFORMATION; CUSTOMER’S RIGHT TO OPT-OUT. You may choose not to provide us with
any Personal Information. In such an event, you may still access and use much of the Services, however, you will not
be able to access and use those portions of the Services that require your Personal Information. If you do not want us
to share your Contact Data with any third parties, please email us at admin@guitartricks.com, or select the “opt out”
box on our online forms. In addition, we maintain a procedure for you to review and request changes to your Personal
Information; this procedure is described in Section 11 below.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>a. Assignment of Personal Information in the Event of Sale or Change in Business Status. In the event of a sale of the
business, or company bankruptcy, we may be required to sell portions of our company or its assets, including the information
collected through the Services. If Company or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, customer
information may be one of the assets transferred to the acquirer. It shall be a necessary condition of any transfer
that these privacy policy principles expressed herein shall continue to remain in force.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p>10. CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. Customer’s personal payment information (e.g., credit card information)
is currently stored with a third-party payment processing company, Braintree or PayPal. We do not store credit card information
on our own service, only on the third-party server “vault.” Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will
keep your other personal information private on secure servers and will not share it with third parties, unless such
disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with a court order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property;
or (c) enforce our Terms of Service. We provide you with the capability to transmit your Personal Data Information via
secured and encrypted channels if you use a similarly equipped web browser.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p>11. DATA PROTECTION OFFICER. Company has designated a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to regularly monitor and maintain the
systems and processes relating to Company’s proper handling of Personal Data Information, and to make sure that
appropriate safeguards be in place to ensure that any processing and retention of Personal Data complies with the GDPR
and Privacy Shield requirements. Moreover, the DPO shall be responsible for the record-keeping relating to all
processing activities, for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with GNPR and Privacy Shield, should a compliance
audit be requested. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p>12. PROCESS TO ACCESS, UPDATE, CORRECT, OR ERASE PERSONAL INFORMATION. We maintain a procedure in order to help you confirm
