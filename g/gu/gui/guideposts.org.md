**INTRODUCTION**

This Privacy Policy explains what information Guideposts (“Guideposts” or “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects on our family of websites, such as [www.guideposts.org](http://www.guideposts.org/), [www.guidepostsfoundation.org](http://www.guidepostsfoundation.org/), [www.shopguideposts.org](http://www.shopguideposts.org/), [www.dailyguideposts.com](http://www.dailyguideposts.com/), and [www.morningswithjesus.org](http://www.morningswithjesus.org/) (together, the “Websites”), how we use your information and the choices you have about the way your information is collected and used. We may add additional Websites from time to time as we expand our offerings and this policy will govern those new Websites when added. You may be accessing our Websites from a computer or mobile device (through an iPhone or iPad, or Android device, for example) and this policy governs your use of the Websites regardless of the means of access. 

Please read this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (available on the Websites) carefully. Your use of the Websites indicates to us that you have read and accepted our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. 

We may also interact with you on third party sites where we post content or invite your feedback, such as [www.facebook.com/guideposts](http://www.facebook.com/guideposts), [www.twitter.com/guideposts.org](http://www.twitter.com/guideposts.org), and [www.youtube.com/guidepostsTV](http://www.youtube.com/guidepostsTV) (“Third Party Sites”).  Except as otherwise described below, this policy does not cover the privacy practices of those Third Party Sites, or of companies that Guideposts does not own or control. You should check the privacy policies of those third parties when providing personally identifiable information through Third Party Sites. 

Our Privacy Policy may change in the future. We invite you to check back periodically to see if we have made any changes. If we make any material changes, we will post a notice on our home page. If you continue to visit or use the Websites after we post notice of changes, we will assume you agree to the changes.  If you do not like the terms of our Privacy Policy, you should not use the Websites.

**WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU DO WE COLLECT?**

Personally identifiable information (“PII”) is information that identifies you or could reasonably be used to identify you personally (such as your real name, address, phone number, or e-mail address). Generally, you may browse our Websites without providing any PII. However, we may ask you to provide PII at various times and places on the Websites, such as when you register on a site or subscribe to our newsletter, or request to receive a message from us (for example, requesting an answer to a Prayer Request).  We may also ask you to provide us with demographic information or information regarding your interests, hobbies or similar information. In some cases, if you choose not to provide us with the information requested, you may not be able to access all areas of the Websites or take advantage of all of the features. We may combine the demographic information we collect with information available from other sources, including information received from promotional partners or other third parties. We may also provide you with the opportunity to post the personal information of others to our Website and others would have the same opportunity to post information about you on our Website (for example, through our Pray for Others feature). ’We encourage you to post such information only of people who are your close friends or family so that ’you are confident that you have their permission to do so.
