# Privacy Policy | Guidepoint

This privacy policy explains how Guidepoint Global, LLC (“Guidepoint,” “we” and “us”) obtains, utilizes, shares and safeguards information collected from Advisors and visitors to its websites, including without limitation www.guidepoint.com and www.guidepoint.com/advisors/ (each, a “Website,” collectively, the “Websites”).

If you reside in the European Union, please see Specific Disclosures for the European Economic Area.

By visiting our Websites or by becoming a Guidepoint Advisor, you consent to the collection, use and transfer of your personal data pursuant to the terms of this privacy policy.

##### The Personal Data We Collect From You

Guidepoint collects personal data that you choose to provide to us on the Websites (including information referenced in the “The Use of Cookies” section of this Privacy Policy), through email, over the phone and otherwise, including your name, contact information, work address, email address, phone number, and if you are a potential Advisor, we additionally collect home address, employment and biographical information, social security numbers, banking information, payment preferences, information obtained from third-party background check providers and feedback concerning your experience as an Advisor. We may also obtain information from third parties about you. In addition, Guidepoint’s Websites may automatically record information when you visit. This information can include your Internet Protocol address and data concerning webpage requests.

Guidepoint may place small files called “cookies” on your computer when you visit the Websites. Cookies facilitate your utilization of the Websites and enable us to track activity and customize your website experience. If you do not wish to receive a cookie from Guidepoint Global, you may set your Internet browser settings to decline or disable the cookie.

##### How Your Personal Data is Used

We utilize personal data collected to market our services to you and develop, support and improve our business and, in the case of Advisors, to match you with consulting opportunities, notify you of Guidepoint Global developments, process your invoices and administer honoraria.

We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties for their marketing or solicitation purposes. We do not use IP addresses or web page request information to try and identify you (nor do we disclose that information to third parties for them to use for their own purposes—although we do use third parties for our internal analytics purposes and retargeting for marketing). Guidepoint and trusted third parties utilize personal data only for the purposes for which it was obtained.

##### How Your Personal Data is Disclosed

Personal data provided to Guidepoint will be processed and stored by us inside the United States and will be accessed by our staff and third parties working for us for the purposes set forth in this policy or for other purposes subject to your consent. Your personal data also may be held, processed and accessed inside the European Economic Area and/or Asia.

Guidepoint may share your personal data with our Clients, typically in connection with consulting opportunities (as this is one of the core and necessary functions provided by our platform). Guidepoint may disclose the fact that you are an Advisor and personal data collected about you in response to a valid order or request by a court or other governmental body, to enforce an agreement between you and Guidepoint or one of Guidepoint’s Clients, to protect Guidepoint’s rights, or as otherwise required by law, legal process or for the prevention or detection of a crime.

Third parties, including your current employer, may request that limitations be placed on your participation in the Network of Advisors arising from duties you may owe to them. Guidepoint will comply with limitations requested by an employer, through an authorized representative, for its current employees. Guidepoint does this to comply with law and best practices. Guidepoint also reserves the right to abide by any limitations requested by a third party for the same reason, on a case-by-case basis. Guidepoint may discuss with third parties your participation or proposed participation in any project through Guidepoint Global for the purpose of verifying any factual information you provide to us or any consents or approvals that may be needed.

##### Updating Your Information

As one of the Terms & Conditions of your participation in the Network of Advisors, you are required to update the biographical and employment information you provide to Guidepoint regularly. You are entitled to review the personal information Guidepoint Global holds about you and may ask that we revise your personal information to ensure that it is current and correct. We may also revise your information using data obtained from third parties or public sources.

##### Information Security

We use physical and technological security measures to protect your information both online and offline from unauthorized access and against illegal manipulation and processing, accidental loss and damage. We will preserve your information for a reasonable period of time or as required by law.

##### Opting Out

You may elect to opt-out of membership in the Network at any time by providing Guidepoint with written or electronic notice. Upon receipt of such notice, we will cease contacting you and cease presenting information concerning you to Clients for potential consulting opportunities.

##### Updates to the Policy

Guidepoint may update this policy from time to time. To the extent permitted by law, any changes to our privacy policy will be posted to the Websites and will become effective upon posting. Your continued use of the Websites and failure to opt out of membership in the Network will indicate your agreement to such changes.

##### Contact Guidepoint

We welcome all requests, suggestions and questions concerning our use of your personal data. All such communication should be directed to privacy@guidepoint.com, or call us at (212) 375-2980.
