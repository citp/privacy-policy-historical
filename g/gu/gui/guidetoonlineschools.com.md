Specifically, it outlines the types of information that GuidetoOnlineSchools.com (the “Site”) gathers about you while you are using the Site (the "Service"), and the ways in which this information is used or shared. It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information.

**Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting the Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.**

**Because the Internet is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future. We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page prior to the change becoming effective so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.**

**By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.**

### **What Information is Collected About Visitors?**

The information that is collected about you while you are using the Service falls into two general categories:

_1\. Information You Provide to Us._

The Site may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply while on the Site and/or use the Service. Specifically, but not exclusively, we collect personal information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, and other information relevant to particular products or services that you choose to enter into one of the Service's forms. We use this information to send you product updates, respond to customer service requests, and to administer your query. If you decline to supply or provide the Site with certain information while using the Service, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Service or by the Company.

Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails (see "Opt-Out Policy" below).

_2\. Log Files._

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, as well as to improve analytics and site functionality.

_3\. Merging of Information._

Information collected through the Site may be merged with information collected from other sources, including offline sources such as modifications requested via phone or email in order to modify contact information. Similarly, information collected through the Site may be stored with information collected from other sources, including offline sources.
