                         University of Birmingham Guild of Students’ Privacy Policy
     1. Statement of Policy – introduction & the Data Protection Act (1998)
The University of Birmingham Guild of Students is fully committed to compliance with the requirements of the
Data Protection Act 1998 which came into force on 1st March 2000. It is also preparing to comply with the
General Data Protection Regulation which will apply from 25 May 2018.
The Guild of Students will therefore follow procedures which aim to ensure that all members, elected officers,
employees, contractors, agents, consultants, or other partners of the Guild of Students who have access to
any personal data held by or on behalf of the Guild of Students, are fully aware of and abide by their duties
under the Data Protection Act 1998.
In order to operate efficiently, the Guild of Students has to collect and use information about people with
whom it works. These may include members of the Guild of Students, current, past and prospective
employees, clients and customers, and suppliers. In addition it may be required by law to collect and use
information in order to comply with the requirements of central government.
This personal information must be handled and dealt with properly, however it is collected, recorded and
used, and whether it be on paper, in computer records or recorded by any other means, and there are
safeguards within the Act to ensure this.
The Guild of Students regards the lawful and correct treatment of personal information as very important to
its successful operations and to maintaining confidence between the Guild of Students and those with
whom it carries out business. The Guild of Students will ensure that it treats personal information lawfully and
correctly.
To this end the Guild of Students fully endorses and adheres to the principles of Data Protection as set out in
the Data Protection Act 1998.
The Principles of Data Protection
The Act stipulates that anyone processing personal data must comply with Eight Principles of good practice.
These Principles are legally enforceable.
The Principles require that personal information:
     •   Shall be processed fairly and lawfully and in particular, shall not be processed unless specific
         conditions are met;
     •   Shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes and shall not be further
         processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes;
     •   Shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which it is
         processed;


                                                                             University of Birmingham
    •   Shall be accurate and where necessary, kept up to date;
    •   Shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes;
    •   Shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects under the Act;
    •   Shall be kept secure i.e. protected by an appropriate degree of security;
    •   Shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area, unless that
        country or territory ensures an adequate level of data protection.
The Act provides conditions for the processing of any personal data. It also makes a distinction between
personal data and “sensitive” personal data.
Personal data is defined as, data relating to a living individual who can be identified from:
    •   that data; or
    •   that data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession
        of the data controller
        and includes an expression of opinion about the individual and any indication of the intentions of the
        data controller, or any other person in respect of the individual.
Sensitive personal data is defined as personal data consisting of information as to:
    •   racial or ethnic origin;
    •   political opinion;
    •   religious or other beliefs;
    •   trade union membership;
    •   physical or mental health or condition;
    •   sexual life;
    •   criminal proceedings, offences or alleged offences.
Handling of Personal/Sensitive Information
The Guild of Students will, through appropriate management and the use of strict criteria and controls;
    •   Observe fully conditions regarding the fair collection and use of personal information;
    •   Meet its legal obligations to specify the purpose for which information is used;
    •   Collect and process appropriate information and only to the extent that it is needed to fulfil
        operational needs or to comply with any legal requirements;
    •   Ensure the quality of information used;
    •   Apply strict checks to determine the length of time information is held;
    •   Take appropriate technical and organisational security measures to safeguard personal information;
    •   Ensure that personal information is not transferred abroad without suitable safeguards;
    •   Ensure that the rights of people about whom the information is held can be fully exercised under the
        Act.
These include:


                                                                              University of Birmingham
   •    The right to be informed that processing is being undertaken;
   •    The right of access to one’s personal information within the statutory 40 days (one month from 25
        May 2018);
   •    The right to prevent processing in certain circumstances; and
   •    The right to correct, rectify, block or erase information regarded as wrong information.

bases for processing members’ information. These are one of the following:
   •    Consent of the data subject;
   •    Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject or to take steps to
        enter into a contract;
   •    Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation;
   •    Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of a data subject or another person.
Conditions for special categories of data

        law
   •    Processing is necessary for carrying out obligations under employment, social security or social
        protection law, or a collective agreement
   •    Processing carried out by a not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union
        aim provided the processing relates only to members or former members (or those who have regular
        contact with it in connection with those purposes) and provided there is no disclosure to a third party
        without consent
   •    Processing relates to personal data manifestly made public by the data subject
   •    Processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or where courts are
        acting in their judicial capacity

        working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or
        treatment or management of health or social care systems and services on the basis of Union or
        Member State law or a contract with a health professional
   •    Consent of the data subject
   •    Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject or to take steps to
        enter into a contract.
