 **TYPE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

Like most website operators, we collect (via its Websites) non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use our Websites.

We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We do not use such information to identify our visitors, and do not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that we use and disclose personally-identifying information, as described above.

Certain visitors to our Websites choose to interact with us in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information like email address, name and surname (to name some). The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction.

We collect such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with us. We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

 **It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our Websites.**

 **PROTECTION OF CERTAIN PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION**

We disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide services available at our Websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using our Websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

We will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, we disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information, only when required to do so by law, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of the Company, third parties or the public at large.

 **HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION**

If you are a registered user of any of our Websites and have supplied your email address, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new lesson updates, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with products that may be of interest to you.

We are committed to delivering only information and educational material we deem will be relevant and of benefit to you. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.

We take all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
