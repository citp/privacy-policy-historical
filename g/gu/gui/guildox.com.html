Privacy Statement for <a class="q5" href="http://www.guildox.com">GuildOx</a><br><br>             

 

GuildOx takes safeguarding online privacy seriously. Please read the following to understand GuildOx's privacy practices.<br><br>

 

From time to time, GuildOx may need to change its privacy statement because of changes in its business, or in its attempts to serve your needs better. GuildOx will use reasonable efforts to publish any changes to its privacy statement.

 
<br><br>
What information does GuildOx gather?<br><br>

 

There are times when GuildOx may need to gather specific information from you such as your name and email address, among other personal information. Information that is essential for GuildOx to provide the services and/or products that are requested by you is generally designated as "Required". Additional information that would allow GuildOx flexibility in providing its services or products, and may be used for internal statistical studies or market research, is generally indicated as "Optional". For example, a credit card number is required when ordering a product, whereas a fax number may not be essential, but would provide another means of communication between you and GuildOx.

 

The choice of how much personally identifiable information you disclose to GuildOx is completely at your discretion. It is never mandatory for you to answer any question, although it may limit the services and products that GuildOx is able to offer.

 
<br><br>
How does GuildOx use personal information?<br><br>

 

When you submit personal information to GuildOx, you understand that you are agreeing to allow GuildOx, its subsidiaries, and its affiliates, access to, storage of, and use of, the data in any of the countries where GuildOx, its subsidiaries, and its affiliates, do business.

 

GuildOx may use the personal information you submit for any purposes related to GuildOx's business, including, but not limited to, generating statistical studies, conducting market research, improving its products and services, sending you surveys, and notifying you of product upgrades and updates, new products, special offers, seminars and conventions and any other changes within GuildOx that may affect you.

 
<br><br>
What choices do you have about how your personal information is used and what is GuildOx's commitment to data quality and reliability?<br><br>

 

GuildOx respects your privacy and realizes that not everyone likes to receive special offers or information.

 

If you would like your name deactivated from GuildOx's lists, or if you would like to unsubscribe from GuildOx's e-mail bulletins, please use the contact information below to request that GuildOx deactivate you from its lists. Be sure to include your name, postal address, telephone number, information contained in your GuildOx mailer, and/or other necessary information requested for deactivation.

 

If you believe that GuildOx may not have your correct and current personal information, you may update your information any time by using the contact information below to inform GuildOx of changes in your personal information.

 

GuildOx will use reasonable efforts to honor your requests, but we appreciate your patience in allowing us a reasonable amount of time for processing.

 
<br><br>
Does GuildOx share the information that it gathers with third parties?<br><br>

 

GuildOx does not share personal data with third parties.

 
<br><br>
Does GuildOx share the information that it gathers with government agencies or law enforcement?<br><br>

 

GuildOx reserves the right to monitor, and disclose to, government officials or law enforcement, without your consent, any communications and personally identifiable information, whenever prompted to do so, by legal authorities, even when you have requested that your information not be disclosed to third parties.

 
<br><br>
What is GuildOx's commitment to data security?<br><br>

 

GuildOx recognizes your concern for security, and will use reasonable efforts to establish secure connections with you and to limit access to databases containing personal information to authorized personnel only.

 
<br><br>
Does GuildOx use cookies?<br><br>

 

"Cookies" give users a unique, random ID by storing small text files onto a user's computer hard drive with the user's browser. Cookies enable a web site to track a user's activities on a web site. For example, GuildOx uses cookies on various pages to maintain session information to allow you to move between parts of the web site without the need to re-login.

 
<br><br>
Do your advertisers use cookies?<br><br>

 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may 
use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your 
visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of 
interest to you. They regularly use cookies to achieve this. If you would like more information 
about this practice and would like to know your options in relation to not having this information 
used by these companies, then <a class="q5" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.

 
<br><br>
Are there online risks?<br><br>

 

You should be aware of risks when you communicate on public newsgroups and message boards. On these forums, personal information may be collected and used by others outside of GuildOx to send unsolicited e-mails or postal mailings. GuildOx has no control over these actions. You should not post any information on these forums that you wish to keep private.

 
<br><br>
What are GuildOx's contact procedures?<br><br>

 

If you believe GuildOx has not adhered to its privacy statement, if you would like to be deactivated from GuildOx's lists, 
or if you would like to update your personal information, you may notify GuildOx via our <a class="q5" href="http://www.guildox.com/go/g.asp?W=AB">contact option</a>. GuildOx will use reasonable efforts to promptly resolve any issues.
