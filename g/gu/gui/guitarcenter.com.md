We may ask or allow you to provide us with personal information on a voluntary basis when you visit one of our stores, call, email or text us or use certain areas of the Site, and you will be required to provide personal information when you make purchases on the Site. The kinds of personal information that we may request may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, email address, telephone number, fax number and credit card information (collectively, “Personal Information”). In addition, the mobile version of the Site or the App may request access to the location of your mobile device. All such information will be treated in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

You may be required to register and create an account (“Account”) to use certain areas of our Site. The email address and password used to create your Account can be used for the Site and the App. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account and are responsible for any activities that occur under your Account.

In order to access some of the features of the Site, you must be signed in to your Account. You may also be able to sign in to the Site by using your social media log-in information. If you sign in through a social media service, we may collect the information in your profile that you have allowed the social media service to share with us.

_IP Addresses and “Cookie” Information:_

As is the case with many websites, the Site logs your IP address and uses standard technology called “cookies,” which are small data files that are downloaded onto your computer when you use the Site. Cookies automatically identify your browser to the guitarcenter.com server whenever you interact with the Site. We use cookies and the information they provide to improve the Site and the quality of your experience with the Site. We do not link IP addresses to your name, email address or other Personal Information. Certain kinds of cookies allow us to store your information to save you time in filling out forms on the Site. We only send this type of cookie to your browser when you have provided your consent for us to save your profile information.

_Web Beacons, Clear GIFs, and Other Technologies:_

The Site may also use “web beacons,” “clear GIFs,” or other technologies to obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses the Site or when you are provided the opportunity to complete surveys, participate in a sweepstakes or other incentives related to the Site, or when you open or respond to any newsletter or other email you may have received from Guitar Center or. These technologies may also be used to deliver cookies that conform to our cookie policy. These technologies may allow us to track your interaction with the Site from all of your devices, including personal computers, mobile devices, and/or tablets. Such cross-device tracking allows us to serve you with relevant advertisements on the most appropriate device.

_Information from Third Parties:_

Guitar Center may obtain additional information from third parties and add it to information we have collected from you. 

_Information Collection on the App:_

The App may also request access to:

  * Your device’s camera or saved photos in order to use certain features such as the scan barcode feature. You can decline to give permission for the App to access your camera or photos, but this feature, and other such features, will not be available to you if you decline.
  * The contact information stored on your device, which is used to populate the “bill to” and “ship to” addresses at checkout when you make a purchase. You will be asked to provide your permission before such access is granted.



The App does not collect the unique identification number assigned to your device by your operating system (sometimes called a “UDID”). The App may send push notifications or notices of interest in the absence of a specific request to your mobile device. In the event the App uses push notifications, you are provided with an opportunity to opt in to receiving them. If you decline to accept push notifications, you will not receive them, which means you may not receive the most current updates and features of the App.

You have choices when it comes to how the App functions on your mobile device. You may be able to manage push notifications and/or manage permissions, such as access to camera, photos, and contacts, by using your built-in mobile device settings and controls.

Access to or availability of controls may vary depending on your device and operating system type and version. In some cases, you may not be able to use the App if you decline all permissions requested.
