**1\. What personal information do we gather?** In general, you may visit Guidewire Software's Web site without providing us with any personal information about yourself. However, there are times when we may need information from you, which includes your Internet address so that we can track unique visits to our site for analytic purposes. Additionally, we may need your personal information such as your name, and your postal and email address in order to grant you access to protected and secured sites or provide you with the opportunity to register for an event, to fulfill your requests for information including white papers, download updates to our products, or participate in an online survey. In other instances, we may ask you to provide us with information such as your product interests so that we can send you only the information that is useful to you, including articles, newsletters, product and service alerts, new product and service announcements and event invitations.

If you wish to apply for a job within the careers section of the site, we will collect personal information about you such as name, email address, and phone number. We will also ask you to provide us with a cover letter and a resume. We use this information to contact you regarding the position in which you expressed interest, to determine whether or not you are qualified for the position and to contact you regarding setting up an interview.

**2\. How do we collect your personal information?** We collect information directly through response forms that you choose to complete. We may also collect information indirectly through the use of cookies. The cookies we use identify you only as a number. "Persistent" cookies are stored on your computer and used in subsequent visits to our sites. "Session" cookies only exist for a specific visit. You can disable your computer from accepting one or both cookie types by changing the settings in the preferences or options menu in your browser. If you disable both types, most of the .com site will function, but you will not be able to log in to certain portions of our support site (Downloads or Knowledge Base pages). If you disable "persistent" cookies, but not "session" cookies, these pages should still function. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personal information you submit while on our site.

**3\. How do we use your personal information?** Information we collect is used to determine what is most effective about our web site, to help us identify ways to improve sites, to personalize the visit for you through the use of "persistent cookies" if you permit it, and to determine how we can tailor our web site to make it more effective. We may also use data for other purposes, which we would describe to you at the point we collect the information (for example, if you are invited to register for an event or request more information about one of our products). When you supply Guidewire Software with your personal information, we may use the information to learn more about you so that we can develop better products and services or use the information, sharing it with our business partners, to inform you about new products, services and offers that may be of interest to you.

We post customer testimonials/videos on our Web site which may contain personal information. We do obtain the customer’s consent via email prior to posting the testimonial or video to post their name along with it. To request removal of your personal information from our testimonials or videos, contact us at [info@guidewire.com](mailto:info@guidewire.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

**4\. Do we share your information with outside parties?** We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. Occasionally, we share information with our business partners to inform you about new products and services that are complementary to your existing Guidewire Software solution. Any information you give to Guidewire Software will be held with the utmost care, and will not be used in ways that you have not consented to.

These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

**5\. What about security?** The security of your personal information is important to Guidewire Software and we take appropriate steps to maintain security of your personal information. The open nature of the Internet is such that data may flow over networks without security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended. While this is out of our control, we aim to apply appropriate levels of security at all times. We use industry standard technologies and maintain current security standards to ensure that your personal information is protected against unauthorized access, disclosure, inappropriate alteration, or misuse.
