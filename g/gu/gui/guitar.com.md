Unless otherwise stated, the capitalized terms in this Privacy Policy are used in the same way as used in our Terms of Use.

## **1\. Your acceptance**

By using the Website, you consent to our processing of Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In particular, you understand and agree that the Information which we collect from you is necessary for us to operate the Website and to interact and communicate with you. If you do not agree with anything in this Privacy Policy, you should stop using the Website.

## **2\. Information we collect**

### **A.   The following is Information which you provide to us directly:**

#### 2.1 Personal details about yourself

In using the Website, you may submit to us your email address when you sign up to our mailing list or when you contact us to make an enquiry.

As you interact and communicate with us, you may also reveal to us other Information about yourself (e.g. your name, address, phone number etc.).

### **B. Other Information which we receive when running the Website:**

#### 2.2 Analytics Information

We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Website. These tools collect information sent by your device, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Website. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other visitors so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual visitor of the Website.

#### 2.3 Cookies and similar technologies

The Website contains “cookies”, clear gifs (also known as “web beacons” and “web bugs”), or similar technology. A cookie is a piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser, which will store the cookie on your computer if your browser is enabled to accept cookies. Web beacons assist in the delivery of cookies and the collection of non-personally identifiable information, such as “click path” and other data as described above.

The Website uses cookies, clear gifs, frames, server log analysis and other technologies as they are developed to customize your experience with the Website. We use them to:

(a) remember information about you so you do not have to keep giving it to us;

(b) help us understand how you and other visitors are using the Website;

(c) help us personalize the Website for you by remembering your preferences and settings; and

(d) find out if our emails have been read and if you have clicked a link in it.

Please note that not all cookies are deleted from your browser after you leave the Website or close your browser.

To manage the Information being collected, you can access the “Settings” in your browser and adjust the “Cookies” settings to:

(a) erase cookies from your computer hard drive;

(b) block acceptance of all or some cookies; or

(c) receive a warning before a cookie is stored.

Please note, however, that if you block cookies, some portions of the Website may not function properly.

#### 2.4 Log file information

Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the web page or app is downloaded to your browser or device.

When you use the Website, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Website, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Mailing List Subscribers which then helps us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Website.

#### 2.5 Device identifiers

When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access the Website, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us.

A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third-party partner about how you browse and use the Website and may help us or others provide reports or personalized Content and ads. Some features of the Website may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

## **3\. How we use your Information**

How we use your Information will depend on the nature of your interaction with the Website and with us. We need to have valid grounds to process your Information. Most times, we would seek your consent, like when you subscribe to our mailing list. Other times, when you reasonably expect us to use your Information, we will not ask for your consent, but only when it is legally permissible for us to do so (e.g. it is necessary for our performance of a contract or for us to comply with a legal obligation etc.).

Generally, we collect and use Information for the following purposes:

(a) to remember information so that you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Website;

(b) to provide personalized Content to you or other interest segment updates, personalized online advertisement or other forms of marketing, like emails about products, services and other information you might be interested in. We may also contact you for market research purposes;

(e) to monitor metrics such as site traffic and demographic patterns;

(f) to respond to your requests or queries; and

(g) to comply with applicable rules, laws, regulations, codes of practice or guidelines issued by any legal or regulatory bodies which are binding on us.

Apart from the above purposes, we may also notify you of other purposes for which we process your Information and seek your consent to such purposes (e.g. when you participate in a survey, provide feedback, enter a competition etc.).

We require that all parties with whom we share Information to implement adequate levels of protection in order to protect such Information. We also require that these parties only process your Information strictly for purposes which we engage them for and consistent with the purposes that we have described in Section 3 (“How we use your Information”) or with other purposes for which your consent has been sought and obtained.

This includes the entities’ making of reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risk to your Information, and removing the Information as soon as it is reasonable to assume that its retention is no longer necessary.

Currently, the country to which Information is transferred for the purpose of storage on cloud servers is the United States of America. We may update this list periodically to reflect any new locations where your Information may be stored.
