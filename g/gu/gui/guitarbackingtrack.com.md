# GuitarBackingTrack.com: Free backing tracks for guitar

  


## Privacy policy

**The tracks**

All backing tracks on this site are the authors own work and submitted to the site.   
They are intended as a supplement for guitarists to improve their skills, and for   
the "bedroom guitarist" to jam along with a virtual band. 

Note: If you find a track on this site that you have made or that has wrong info,   
please let me know so I can give proper credit. If you want a backing track removed,   
let me know and I'll remove it. You can contact me via this [form](https://web.archive.org/contact.php). 

**Forms**

All information received via forms will be kept confidential. The reason I ask   
for your E-mail address on the contact form is so I know how to get back to you.   
These addresses will not be used for anything other than giving replies.
