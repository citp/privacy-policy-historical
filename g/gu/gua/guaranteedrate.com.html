        <li>Information collected from your web browser when you visit our  websites (such as date, time and areas of our websites that were  visited). </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Information We Collect When You Browse Our Website</h3>
      <p>We do not access information about your identity while you browse  our website. Although we collect information about the date, time and  area of our website that you visited, you remain anonymous to us. Only  if you decide to apply for a loan with us directly or through a broker,  do we collect any personally identifying information about you.</p>

      <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
      <p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.

      <p>We use session cookies to tailor your experience on our site. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.</p>
      <p>The use of cookies by third parties, including but not limited to our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers is not covered by our privacy statement.

Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. </p>
      <p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>

        <li>When you explicitly instruct us (Opt-In) to forward your  application to another lender. Example: You may consider it beneficial  for us to forward you loan application to another lender who may be  able to help you in the event we are unable to offer you a loan that  meets your needs. You may find this convenient since it means you may  not need to search for another lender or complete another loan  application. If you are interested in this benefit, you will be  afforded to opportunity to opt-in at the end of the loan application.</li>
