## Use of cookies, IP addresses and website traffic information

Sesam Limited uses tracking technology such as cookies or tags to gather such information as outlined above (see “What information is collected” and “How do we share your personal data“) and to understand how visitors use the guardian-angel-reading.com website. Tracking technology helps us manage and improve the usability of the guardian-angel-reading.com website, for example by determining whether there has been any contact between your computer’s IP address and us in the past and identifying the most popular sections of the guardian-angel-reading.com website. In concrete terms, guardian-angel-reading.com’s server sends information to your computer, mobile phone or other electronic device which is then stored on your hard drive. The IP address of your computer or other device is used in order to identify visits to guardian-angel-reading.com from your computer or other device and to keep track of your browsing habits and optimize the time required to load pages.

Cookies are pieces of data (small electronic text files) stored on your device/terminal equipment that contain data about a user or its device. They allow the storage of information for a determinate period of time and the identification of the user’s electronic device.

When you visit the website for the first time, the entry page will show information on privacy and respective wording regarding the consent to the use of cookies through a _“cookie banner”_. If you continue to actively use the website and do not actively object to the use of cookies, you agree to our use of cookies and your IP address and such consent will be stored in your browser, so that the information does not have to be repeated on every page of the website. Should the consent be missing in your browser (e.g. if you deleted your browser history), the _“cookie banner”_ with privacy information will appear again the next time you visit the website.

In order to render the services, we install and use certain technically required cookies which therefore do not require your prior consent. We also use session cookies which are automatically deleted at the end of your session and which also do not require your prior consent. Other cookies (such as cookies to improve the navigational experience by keeping record of certain data – this avoids you having to reintroduce such data at each connection – and by tailoring the content of the services to your preferences) may be installed and used on the basis of your consent. You may, at any time, delete or block cookies in your browser parameters or through Ads settings and Ads settings for mobile apps. However, in such case some functionalities of the services or website requiring the use of cookies for technical purposes may be reduced or may no longer be available to you.

We use analytics cookies to gather general information on how users use the services and the website, e.g. which pages they visit most frequently and whether they receive any error messages from websites. These cookies do not collect any data that may lead to an identification of the user. All information collected with the aid of such cookies exclusively serves the purpose to comprehend and improve the functionality of our services and website. We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). The information regarding your usage of the services and the website generated by the use of Google Analytics is usually transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the US. Google will use this information on our behalf to analyze your use of the website, compile reports on website activity and provide other website and internet usage-related services for the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data. You can prevent recorded data generated by the cookie concerning your use of the website (including your IP address) from being sent to Google and prevent the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via the link <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>. Additional information on the Terms of Use and Data Privacy Policy of Google Analytics may be found at <https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/> and <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/>.

Some of our pages may also contain web beacons which allow us to collect information on the volume and origin of visitor traffic to our pages as well as general demographic information about these visitors. This data is stored anonymously, it does not contain any personal information and can thus be disclosed to third parties, particularly for information or statistical analysis purposes, particularly in order to analyze the performance of our marketing promotions.

We may also use advertising cookies to collect certain demographics and usage statistics to improve the services. In particular, we use the following Google Analytics Advertising Features: Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting; Integrated services that require Google Analytics to collect data via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers.

We also make use of “social plugins”, i.e. plugins for social networks, including particularly the Facebook “Share” button. The facebook.com website is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. The plug-ins usually feature the Facebook logo. Besides Facebook, we use plug-ins by Twitter (provider: Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA), Pinterest (provider: Pinterest Inc., 808 Brannan Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA (if you are located in the USA), Pinterest Europe Ltd., Palmerston House, 2nd Floor, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, Ireland (if you are located outside the USA)), Instagram (1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA) and GooglePlus (provider: Google).

For data privacy reasons, we deliberately opted against utilizing direct social network plug-ins on our website. Instead, we employ an alternative technical solution that allows you to decide whether to transmit data to the social network operators and when. Thus when you visit the website, data are never automatically transmitted to social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. Only when you actively click on the respective button yourself will your web browser connect to the servers of the respective social network, i.e. clicking on elements then clicking on the social network’s icon indicates your consent to your browser connecting to the servers of the respective social network and sending usage data to that social network operator, whether or not you are a subscriber of such social network.

We have no influence over the nature or scope of data that social networks may then gather. For information regarding the purpose and scope of data collection, further processing and use of data by social networks and regarding your data privacy rights and relevant configuration settings, see the social networks’ respective data privacy advisories.

## Use of your testimonials

From time to time, we may post customer testimonials on our website. We either use scrambled customer information that does not allow the identification of our customers or, if such testimonials allow the identification of our customers, will obtain your prior consent by e-mail to allow Sesam Limited to use the following information for promotional purposes or for testimonials: first name, surname initial, picture, town/city, country of residence, all or parts of the correspondence e-mails between you and the brand operated by Sesam Limited.
