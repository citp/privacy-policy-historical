We want you to know that we do not sell nonpublic personal information to third parties for any purpose. To help you better understand how we protect your personal information we are providing you with the following statement describing our practices and policies with respect to the privacy of customer information.

## Important Definitions

We, our, or _us_ means Guaranty Bank (d/b/a BestBank in Michigan and Georgia) or one of its subsidiaries, including Shelter Mortgage Company, LLC and Guaranty Mortgage Services, LLC. _Nonpublic personal information_ means information about you that we collect in connection with providing a financial product or service to you. Nonpublic personal information does not include information that is available from public sources, such as telephone directories or public government records. An _affiliate_ is within the Guaranty Bank family of companies. An affiliate may include a company we own or control, a company that owns or controls us, and a company that is owned and controlled by the same company that owns or controls us. For example, Shelter Mortgage is an affiliate of Guaranty Bank; Guaranty Mortgage Services is an affiliate of Shelter Mortgage; and Guaranty Bank is an affiliate of Guaranty Mortgage Services. _A nonaffiliated third party is a company that is not an affiliate of ours._

  * Information you provide to us on an application for an account, loan, or other financial product or service
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others
  * Information we receive from a credit reporting agency



## Limitations on Information Sharing

As noted earlier, Guaranty Bank does not sell nonpublic personal information to third parties for any purpose.

## Service Providers/Joint Marketing Providers

To provide you with products, services, and special offers that we believe may meet your financial needs, we may share nonpublic personal information that we collect, as described above, to nonaffiliated third parties that conduct marketing services on our behalf, or to inform you of financial products and services offered pursuant to a joint agreement between us and another financial institution, such as a credit card company or insurance company.

Therefore, you do not need to take any action to prevent this disclosure.

## How We Protect Your Information

We maintain strict procedures and policies to govern the management of your nonpublic personal information. All nonaffiliated third parties are legally obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the customer information we provide them and to use the information only for the purposes for which it was provided. Employee access to customer information is limited to those who have a business reason for knowing such information. We educate and train our employees on the importance of confidentiality and customer privacy.
