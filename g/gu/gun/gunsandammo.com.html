    <td width="100%">This site sends three types of email communications: 1.) notifications
    related to auction activity, 2.) 'Saved Search' notifications, and 3.) opt-in newsletters
    and promotional email messages.<p>1.) Notifications related to auction activity are
    generated as a result or registering for the auction site, bidding on items, or listing
    items for sale. These notifications can include bid confirmations, winning bidder notices,
    item listing confirmations, item sold notifications, monthly statements, billing messages,
    and other notifications related to activity on the auction site. You cannot opt out of
    receiving notifications related to auction activity, however, if you do not bid nor list
    items and your account balance is zero you will not receive any such notifications from
    this site.</p>
    <p>If you are a registered buyer or seller on this auction site we may send you certain
    notices, such as notices of a substantial change in the policies and/or operation of our
    site. These notices are sent extremely infrequently and cannot be opted out of other than
    by closing your account with us.</p>
    <p>2.) Saved Search notifications are generated at your request to inform you when items
    matching certain search criteria have been listed on the auction site. There are removal
    instructions at the bottom of every such notification message. You can delete your saved
    searches to stop receiving the notifications by going to <a href="/auction/MyAuctions.asp">My
    Auctions</a> then clicking <a href="/auction/MyAuctions.asp?Tab=5">Saved Searches</a>.
    Removal instruction appear on that page.</p>
    <p>3.) Opt-in newsletters and promotional email messages are mailing lists that you choose
    to subscribe to during auction registration or by using various opt-in pages or forms on
    this site. All such lists are 100% opt-in; in other words you will never receive any
    newsletter or promotional email from this site unless you have specifically elected to be
    on the applicable email list. You may opt out of these mailings at any time and we have
    made it very easy to do so. To opt out of future newsletter or promotional email <a href="http://mail.gunbroker.com/members.asp">click here</a> and follow the instructions on
    the subsequent pages.</p>
    <p>You can access the OptIn / OptOut pages at any time by clicking <a href="/user/ToolsForBuyers.asp">For Buyers</a> or <a href="/user/ToolsForSellers.asp">For
    Sellers</a> from the top of any auction site page, then clicking <a href="/user/OptInMailManagement.asp">OptIn Mail and Newsletter Preferences</a></p></td>
