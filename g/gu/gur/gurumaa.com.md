SECURITY MEASURES  
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. When you place orders, you get redirected to payment gateways or the third party.  
For all transactions on www.gurumaa.com, whether it is for purchasing of products or making contributions of registering for events or any other transaction involving movement of funds, we use third party payment processing gateways for all financial transactions. They take all the necessary measures for safe online payment processing.  
We use the following two third party payment processing gateways -  
1. CCAvenue for INR Transactions &   
2. Paypal for USD Transactions  
We do not collect any payment related information like credit card number or bank account details or any other online payment service account details directly on www.gurumaa.com.  
In a nutshell, each time you carry out any transaction on our website, you are redirected to the secure servers of CCAvenue or Paypal for payment processing.  
After the third party has approved your payment, we proceed to the next step of processing your order.  
Note - Paypal is secured & best payment gateway for USD transactions and CCAvenue for INR transactions.
