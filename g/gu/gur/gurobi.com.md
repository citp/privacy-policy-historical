## 11\. Cookies Policy - Information Gurobi Optimization collects from you

### a. What is a cookie?

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer, tablet or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.

On Gurobi Optimization’s website, cookies record information about your preferences and interests on www.gurobi.com, allow us to set up an account for you, and allow us to keep track of if you are logged in or not (to access your account).

### b. How does Gurobi Optimization use cookies?

Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyze the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example, if we find that many people go to a particular webpage on our website but then quickly leave the page and go to another page, we can investigate if we need to change the content on that first page to better meet the expectations/needs of website visitors. Any third parties are strictly required not to use any information for their own business or other purposes (see section 7 above). Certain areas of Gurobi Optimization websites may use cookies for a specific reason - for example, to identify you and allow you to access your license information. 

### c. Gurobi Optimization cookies and how to reject cookies?

If you don’t want to receive cookies, you can modify your browser so that it notifies you when cookies are sent to it or you can refuse cookies altogether. You can also delete cookies that have already been set.

If you wish to restrict or block web browser cookies that are set on your device, you can do this through your browser settings; the Help function within your browser should tell you how. Alternatively, you may wish to visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/), which contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of desktop browsers.

It is important to note that if you change your settings and block certain cookies, this means that certain personalized features cannot then be provided and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the websites' features.
