# Gurock Software's Privacy Policy

## Last Updated: May 3, 2018

Gurock Software GmbH ("Gurock") is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of our customers, partners, webinars attendees and website visitors. Specifically, we do not sell, rent or trade email lists with other companies for marketing purposes. In this Privacy Statement we describe Gurock's privacy practices in relation to the use of Gurock Website (as defined below) and the related applications, services, products and programs offered by Gurock (collectively, "Services"), as well as individuals’ choices regarding use, access and correction of personal information.

If you have questions or complaints regarding Gurock’s Privacy Statement or associated practices, please contact us at [compliance@gurock.io](mailto:%20compliance@gurock.io).

This Privacy Statement covers the information practices, including how Gurock collects, uses, shares and secures the personal information you provide to its website (the "Gurock Website").

Personal information means any information that may be used to identify you, such as, your name, title, phone number, email address, or mailing address.

In general, you can browse our website without giving us any personal information. We use web analytics software to analyze traffic to this web site in order to understand our customer's and visitor's needs and to continually improve our site for them. This software collects only anonymous, aggregate statistics. For example, we do not tie a specific visit to a specific IP address.

If you want to subscribe to a periodic communication such as a newsletter, we ask you to simply provide your business email address ("Optional Information"). Additional activities on our site may require you to be registered, for example, to read a white paper, download trial or free software, when you express an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services or register for an event. As part of the registration process, we may ask you for additional personal information, such as name, Gurock name, address, phone number, and email address (“Required Information”). We use that information for several general purposes: to tell you about products and services if you so request, to fulfill your request, to contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to verify the accuracy of our records, to contact you regarding customer satisfaction surveys. 

For our downloadable software products, as part of the Required Information, on installation and execution, some of our products may send Gurock certain information, including product version, product edition, and information about the operation system and/or environment where the product is installed. Solely for our software as a service products, as part of the Required Information and in order to provide the Services to you, we store all the content you provide, including but not limited to accounts created for team members, files, pictures, project information, and any other information that you provide to the Services you use. Even though Gurock stores these data as part of its Services to you, Gurock does not have access or collect such data. We may also collect data about usage of the software. This may include, but is not limited to, numbers of users and groups, frequency and size of attachments, actions invoked in the product, IP addresses used to access the service, operating environment, and other interactions with product features. This information may be analyzed for security and auditing purposes.

When purchasing Services or registering for an event, Gurock may also require you to provide your billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number (“Billing Information”). Some activities require additional personal information. For example, to fulfill online orders for products, we require you to enter credit card information, and you have the option to provide a separate shipping address. When visitors of Gurock Website apply for a job with Gurock, Gurock may also require you to submit additional personal information as well as a resume or curriculum vitae (“Applicant Information”). Gurock may check for license validation and software updates for some of its products. Required Information, Optional Information, Billing Information, Applicant Information and any other information you submit to the Gurock through the Services or information provided to you by the Gurock through your use of the Services (e.g. license key) are referred to collectively as “Data.”

As you navigate Gurock Website, Gurock may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons. Website Navigational Information as defined in Section 7 below, includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on Idera’s web pages viewed and the links clicked). For additional information about the collection of Website Navigational Information by Idera and others, please see Section 7 below.

Gurock uses Data about Gurock’s customers to perform the Services requested. For example, if you fill out a “Try TestRail for free” Web form, Gurock will use the information provided to contact you about your interest in the Services. In addition, the Gurock may use Data where it believes, in our sole judgment, to protect our rights and interests, for example to check for license validation either using the license key or your account details. Some software products can also use license information to inform you of the availability of applicable updates.

Gurock also uses Data about webinars attendees to plan and host corporate events, host online forums and social networks in which event attendees may participate, and to populate online profiles for webinars attendees on Gurock Website. Additional information on Gurock’s privacy practices with respect to Data about webinars attendees may be found in additional privacy statements on the event Websites, as the case may be.

Gurock may also use Data about customers and webinar attendees for marketing purposes. For example, Gurock may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in the Services and to send you information regarding Gurock, its affiliates, and its partners, such as information about promotions or events.

Gurock may also receive information about customers and attendees from other sources, including third parties from whom we have purchased data, and combine this information with Data we already have about you. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and create more tailored advertising to provide products and services that may be of interest to you.

Gurock uses credit card information solely to collect payment from prospective customers and attendees.

Gurock uses Website Navigational Information to operate and improve Gurock Website. Gurock may also use Website Navigational Information alone or in combination with Data about customers and Data about webinar attendees to provide personalized information about Gurock. For additional information about the use of Website Navigational Information, please see the Section 7 below.

## Business Partners.

From time to time, Gurock may partner with other companies to jointly offer products, services or programs (such as webinars or downloadable content) such as our channel partners to fulfill product trials and information requests, and provide customers and prospective customers with information about Gurock and its products. To do this, we may pass your information to them for that purpose only, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. Gurock does not share Data about the Gurock attendees with business partners unless: (1) you specifically opt in to such sharing via an event registration form; or (2) you attend a Gurock event and allow the Gurock or any of its business partners to scan your attendee badge.

## Do Not Track. 

Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a "do not track" or "DNT" option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Gurock does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to Gurock Website, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Gurock takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
