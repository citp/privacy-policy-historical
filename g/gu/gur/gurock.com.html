                        <p>Gurock Software GmbH ("Gurock") is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of our customers, partners, webinars attendees and website visitors. Specifically, we do not sell, rent or trade email lists with other companies for marketing purposes. In this Privacy Statement we describe Gurock's privacy practices in relation to the use of Gurock Website (as defined below) and the related applications, services, products and programs offered by Gurock (collectively, "Services"), as well as individuals’ choices regarding use, access and correction of personal information.</p>
                        <p>If you have questions or complaints regarding Gurock’s Privacy Statement or associated practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto: compliance@gurock.io">compliance@gurock.io</a>.</p>
                        <h1 class="privacy-page">1. Website covered</h1>
                        <p>This Privacy Statement covers the information practices, including how Gurock collects, uses, shares and secures the personal information you provide to its website (the "Gurock Website").</p>
                        <h1 class="privacy-page">2. Collection of Personal Information</h1>
                        <p>Personal information means any information that may be used to identify you, such as, your name, title, phone number, email address, or mailing address.</p>
                        <p>In general, you can browse our website without giving us any personal information. We use web analytics software to analyze traffic to this web site in order to understand our customer's and visitor's needs and to continually improve our site for them. This software collects only anonymous, aggregate statistics. For example, we do not tie a specific visit to a specific IP address.</p>
                        <p>
                            If you want to subscribe to a periodic communication such as a newsletter, we ask you to simply provide your business email address ("Optional Information"). Additional activities on our site may require you to be registered, for example, to read a white paper, download trial or free software, when you express an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services or register for an event. As part of the registration process, we may ask you for additional personal information, such as name, Gurock name, address, phone number, and email address (“Required Information”). We use that information for several general purposes: to tell you about products and services if you so request, to fulfill your request, to contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to verify the accuracy of our records, to contact you regarding customer satisfaction surveys.
                        </p>

Solely for our software as a service products, as part of the Required Information and in order to provide the Services to you, we store all the content you provide, including but not limited to accounts created for team members, files, pictures, project information, and any other information that you provide to the Services you use. Even though Gurock stores these data as part of its Services to you, Gurock does not have access or collect such data. We may also collect data about usage of the software. This may include, but is not limited to, numbers of users and groups, frequency and size of attachments, actions invoked in the product, IP addresses used to access the service, operating environment, and other interactions with product features. This information may be analyzed for security and auditing purposes.</p>
                        <p>When purchasing Services or registering for an event, Gurock may also require you to provide your billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number (“Billing Information”). Some activities require additional personal information.

                        <h2>Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Addresses.</h2>
                        <p>Gurock uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate Gurock Website (“Website Navigational Information”).

                        <h2>Cookies</h2>

                        <p>The following sets out how Gurock uses different categories of cookies.</p>
                        <h2>Required Cookies: </h2>
                        <p>
                            Required cookies enable you to navigate Gurock Website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website and using Gurock Services.
                          If you have chosen to identify yourself to Gurock, Gurock may place on your browser cookies containing an encrypted, unique identifier. These cookies allow Gurock to uniquely identify you when you are logged into Gurock Website and Services and to process your online transactions and requests.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Functionality Cookies: </h2>
                        <p>Functionality cookies allow Gurock Website and Services to remember information you have entered or choices you make (such as your username, language, or your region) and provide enhanced, more personal features.&nbsp;These cookies also enable you to optimize your use of Gurock Website and Services after logging in. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize.</p>
                        <p>Functional cookies may also be used to improve how Gurock Website and Services function and perform, to enhance and customize your interactions with Gurock, and to help us provide you with more relevant messages, including marketing communications. These cookies collect information about how website visitors use our Website and Services, including which pages visitors go to most often and if they receive error messages from certain pages.</p>
                        <p>
                            Gurock may use its own technology (under Gurock brand name or an affiliated brand name) or third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from website visitors, attendees, and customers, to provide enhanced interactions and more relevant communications, and to track the performance of Gurock's advertisements. Gurock and its third-party partners may also utilize HTML5 local storage or Flash cookies for these purposes.

                        </p>
                        <h2>Targeting or Advertising Cookies: </h2>
                        <p>Gurock sometimes uses cookies delivered by third parties to show you ads for Gurock products and services that we think may interest you on any devices you may use and to track the performance of Gurock advertisements.&nbsp; For example, in these cases, cookies remember information such as which browsers have visited Gurock Website. The information provided to third parties does not include personal information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after Gurock receives it. If Gurock is using one of its own cookie-related products on our own Website, then a cookie related to ads may appear on our Website under Gurock or one of our affiliated Gurock's name.</p>
                        <p>Gurock also contracts with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from Web beacons (see below) on Gurock Website and Services, from emails, and on third-party websites.&nbsp;Ad networks follow your online activities over time and across different sites or other online services by collecting Website Navigational Information through automated means, including through the use of cookies. These technologies may recognize you across the different devices you use, such as a desktop or laptop computer, smartphone or tablet. Third parties use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements on other websites or mobile applications on any of your devices.&nbsp;This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Third parties, with whom Gurock partners to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.&nbsp; Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.</p>
                        <h2>Do Not Track. </h2>
                        <p>Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a "do not track" or "DNT" option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Gurock does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to Gurock Website, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Gurock takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>
