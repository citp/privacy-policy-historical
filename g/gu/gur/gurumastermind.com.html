								Guru MasterMind only contacts individuals who specifically request that
								we do so or in the event that they have signed up to receive our free
								newsletters or have purchased one of our products. Guru MasterMind collects
								personally identifying information from our users during online registration
								and online purchasing. Generally, this information includes name and e-mail
								address for registration to receive our free newsletters and name, postal address,
								and credit card information when purchasing our products. All of this information
								is provided to us by you.

								Cookies: Like many other commercial sites, our Site utilizes standard technologies 
								called "cookies" and clear GIFs to collect information about how our Site is used. 
								A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer's hard 
								drive (if your web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to 
								us. Cookies were designed to help a website recognize a user's browser as a previous 
								visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the 
								user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot be read by a website other than the one 
								that set the cookie. A cookie cannot pass on a computer virus or capture any of the 
								Personally Identifiable Information that resides on your computer.<br><br>

								Clear GIFs: At times, we work with third-party service partners that employ clear GIFs 
								(also known as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs, web beacons or action tags) for our benefit 
								to help us measure advertising effectiveness. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique 
								identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of 
								our users. The main difference between the two is that clear GIFs are invisible on the 
								page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. 
								Clear GIFs are not tied to your Personally Identifiable Information and only track the 
								visitor traffic and behavior to and on our Site.<br><br>

								Clear GIFs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same 
								website or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited 
								"www.companyX.com", which uses an advertising company's clear GIF, the website would match 
								the clear GIFs identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past 
								online behavior for that computer. This collected information can be shared with the 
								advertising company. We do, at times, provide such information to our third-party advertising 
								service partners, but that information can only be used by our partner for our benefit and 
								never includes personally identifiable information.
