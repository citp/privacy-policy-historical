This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by ZenPayroll, Inc., a Delaware corporation doing business as Gusto, and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “ **Gusto** ,” “ **we** ,” “ **us** ” or “ **our** ”) when you access or use our website (the “ **Site** ”) and our online payroll, benefits, human resources and other related services (the “ **Service** ”), which are provided through the Site. By using the Site and/or the Service, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

### Information We Collect and How We Collect It

In connection with your access to our Site and/or use of our Service, we collect and store certain information about you. Some of this information can be used on its own or in combination with other information to identify you individually. We call that information “personal information.” We collect personal information and other information as described below:

  * _Information You Provide._ We collect your personal information when you or your employer registers to use the Service, provides information when using the Site or Service, updates your account information, adds additional services, submits information to verify your identity, contacts us with questions or feedback, or otherwise communicates with us. This personal information may include your name, address, email address, phone number, bank account information and taxpayer identification number. 
  * _When You Choose to Participate in Market Research Programs._ We may collect information from you, including personal information, if you choose to participate in a market research program or survey. 
  * _Your Email or Social Network Contacts._ We collect your email, social network and other contacts (“ **Contacts** ”) if you choose to share them with us, or you choose to refer potential customers to us via our referral programs (the “ **Referred Leads** ”). 
  * _Public Information._ We may collect information about you from public sources, such as public social media pages. 
  * _Information from Third Parties._ We may collect and receive information about you, including personal information and financial account information, from third parties, such as financial institutions and our service providers, for identity verification, fraud protection, risk assessment and other purposes. We may collect your business information from credit bureaus for the foregoing purposes as well. In addition, we may receive demographic information about you from third parties to help us better understand our users and to improve and market our Service. 
  * _Health and Health Insurance Information._ If you or your employer uses the Service to manage your health benefits (the “ **Benefits Service** ”), we may receive health information about you and your dependents in order to provide the Benefits Service. The health information may include information about your insurance carrier, insurance plan and claims you submit for coverage. We receive the health information (i) directly from you when you submit enrollment or claims information, or otherwise provide health information to us; (ii) from the primary policyholder on your benefits plan, if you are a spouse or dependent of the primary policyholder; (iii) from your employer; (iv) from insurance carriers; or (v) from other third-party administrators. 
  * _Automatically Collected Information._ We automatically collect certain usage information when you access the Site or use the Service, such as your device identifier (if using a mobile device), Internet Protocol (IP) address (if using a browser), operating system, browser type and the address of a referring site. We also automatically collect certain usage information through cookies and related technologies, as described below. In addition, our Site may implement third-party software, such as Google’s Invisible reCAPTCHA (the “ **Invisible CAPTCHA** ”), that collects your information for security purposes. 
  * _Single Sign-On Information._ Single Sign-On allows you to sign in to the Service from another service you use and with which we partner. We will collect certain information for security purposes in order to verify your authorized access to the Service, including your username and password for the other service.
