Gushcloud offers an import tool that helps you import your tag information into your profile to convert into tags. You may edit the tags if they are incorrect or misleading.

You may also hide or delete these tags whenever necessary.

## Site activity information.

We may perform anonymous tracking of some of the actions you perform on Gushcloud, such as adding connections (including adding a friend on Gushcloud), performance of a task (including bonus tasks), posting a cloud or adding tags. For example, if you share a video link, we may log the fact that you shared it. All tracking information is anonymized and used for the purpose of A/B website testing as well as usability testing and website layout refinements. Your tracking information will never be sold to third parties, nor will you be identified by your actions.

## Access Device and Browser Information.

When you access Gushcloud from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit. All tracking information is anonymized and used for the purpose of geographic filtering, applying the correct content distribution method as well optimizing the website's content for viewing on the correct platform.

## Cookie Information.

We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to make Gushcloud easier to use, to make the website customized to your preferences, and to protect both you and Gushcloud. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to Gushcloud. We also use them to confirm that you are logged into Gushcloud, and to know when you are interacting with Gushcloud Platform applications and websites, our widgets and Share buttons, and our advertisements. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use Gushcloud in the intended manner.

## Name and Profile Picture.

Gushcloud is designed to make it easy for you to find and connect with others. For this reason, your name and profile picture do not have any privacy filters by default. You may however adjust these settings in "discoverability" settings on your "my account" page.

  * Follow you on Twitter
  * See your publishing activity
  * See your Gushcloud activity



## Gender and Birth Date.

In addition to name and email address, we require you to provide your gender and birth date during the sign in process. We ask for your date of birth to verify that you are 13 years of age or older, and so that we can better limit your access to content that are not deemed appropriate. Because your date of birth and gender are required, you cannot delete them. You can, however, edit your profile to hide all (or part) of such fields from other users.

## Country of Residence

Gushcloud will require your country of residence and like profile name and picture, it is visible to all Gushcloud users as a default. The reason being cloud posters will know whether you can be applicable and suitable to do a specific task with regards to your country.

## Getting Verified

Verification is an important step to ensure that you are indeed an autonomous human being and not any form of harmful automated entity. Thus we need to authenticate you as person who has sign up for a particular account as Gushcloud involves transactions that are financial in nature. This process also helps us to ensure that there is no account duplication or duplicate accounts made by a particular individual. If a person is not verified, he cannot withdraw any funds or perform clouds with monetary rewards. In order to be verified, we will ask for your mobile number. We will send you an automatically generated pin on our end by SMS and confirm the mobile number. We will also ask for your country of residence, address and zip code for verification purposes also.

We will not use your address for any other purpose but verification only. Your address will be kept private and confidential, in which will not be shown to other people in any Gushcloud page.

## Gushworth Score

Your Gushworth is a score compromising of the following (amongst others)

  * Number of friends in Facebook
  * Activity rate in Facebook
  * Number of followers in Twitter
  * Activity rate in Twitter
  * Number of people viewing your blog
  * Your task rating from cloud poster upon completion
  * Number of tasks done
  * Number of paid clouds per month
  * Public social influence (eg If user is a celebrity in your country)



Your Gushworth will be shown together with your name and profile picture, in which has also no privacy filter. Your Gushworth identifies how much influence you have in your social network, your network spread, how well you do a task and your authenticity in Gushcloud. The cloud posters will know to whom to prioritize and target for invites to the cloud. It also helps the cloud poster to identify spammers, frauds, authentic users and people who _repeatedly_ do not do their task accordingly.

## Badges

When you have attended a particular score for your Gushworth, your badge will be changed and you will be identified correspondingly. Your badge has no privacy settings and like profile name and picture, is visible to any user of Gushcloud.

## Connectivity

The number of friends you have will not have any privacy filters. Anyone, as like profile name and picture can be seen by all Gushcloud account holders. People can also see who your friends are in order to judge the target demographics.

## Social Networking Accounts

In order to do specific tasks, one needs to identify and link your Facebook and/or Twitter account. Cloud posters can select and filter Facebook users if the task is specific to Facebook, similar for Twitter. The Gushcloud user will not be available to do a Facebook task if he/she has not linked and identify his/her Facebook account.

You may link these social networking accounts to Gushcloud

## Minors.

We reserve the right to add special protections for minors (such as to provide them with an age-appropriate experience) and place restrictions on the ability of adults to share and connect with minors, recognizing this may provide minors a more limited experience on Gushcloud.

## Clouds done and created

Anyone will be able to see how many task you have done and clouds you created. Gushcloud users can see clouds you created and done, and it will help cloud posters what invites. The number of task you have done will also help a cloud poster how experienced you are in doing cloud tasks. The latest task that you have successfully accomplished will be published into your friends' gush feeds if it is not a "closed" or private task.

## Cloud posting privacy

There are 4 types of privacy settings for clouds:

Open to everyone: Anyone can view and do this cloud.

Open to everyone: Anyone can do this cloud so long as the cloud has a similar tag to the searched tags.

Closed cloud: Only invited people can do this task and invited friends in the bonus task option will be able to see this cloud as well.

Closed cloud: Only invited people can do this task.

If you want to create a cloud that you only want a closed circle of people to do this task, then you should select "closed" in step 8 of the cloud posting options.

## Your Wallet

The funds available in your wallet will never be made public on your public profile by Gushcloud. However, your cloud activities will be made public. We strongly advise not to reveal your monetary transfers and funds residing in your wallet to protect your account and prevent unwanted and malicious attention.

## Transaction History

  * Funds transferred to/from another Gushcloud user
  * Rewards for doing task (including bonus task)
  * Budget paid for clouds created
  * Refunds to wallet for unused budget in cloud

  * Withdrawals and deposits from bank



We will keep all of these transactions as receipts in the case if there are any issues or disputes, these data will facilitate us to process them more efficiently. All your transactions will be between you and Gushcloud only, and no one else should view transactions made between you and Gushcloud.

## Transfer funds to another Gushcloud friend

You can transfer funds to another Gushcloud friend whenever necessary. The transaction will remain private and confidential between you, the recipient and Gushcloud. We will not be responsible in way for disputes between you and the recipient.

## Survey Analytics

When a survey-type cloud is created, the cloud poster will be able to see the up-to-date survey results. The cloud poster can see the percentage of answers for each choice. However, the cloud poster will be unable to see who selected a particular answer in the poll results due to respect of anonymity and privacy of all Gushcloud users.

## To manage the service.

We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support. We also use a variety of technological systems to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.

## To supplement your profile.

We may use information about you that we collect from other Gushcloud, Twitter and Facebook users to supplement your profile (such as when you are tagged in a photo or mentioned in a status update). In such cases we generally give you the ability to remove the content (such as allowing you to remove a photo tag of you) or limit its visibility on your profile.

## Downloadable Software.

Certain downloadable software applications and applets that we offer, such as our browser toolbars and photo uploaders, transmit data to us. We may not make a formal disclosure if we believe our collection of and use of the information is the obvious purpose of the application, such as the fact that we receive photos when you use our photo uploader. If we believe it is not obvious that we are collecting or using such information, we will make a disclosure to you the first time you provide the information to us so that you can decide whether you want to use that feature.

## When you invite a friend to join.

When you ask us to invite a friend to join Gushcloud, we will send your friend a message on your behalf using your name. The invitation may also contain information about other users your friend might know. We may also send up to two reminders to them in your name. We will only allow a non-Gushcloud account holder to receive such invites 2 times a week. We want to do our best to keep Gushcloud a spam free platform as much as possible.

## Filtering Friends

If you feel that there is a particular Gushcloud user whom you want to block from doing your cloud or vice versa inviting you to do his/her cloud, you can do it in the "discoverability" button. You should protect yourself and block potential spammers, frauds, dual account holders, etc to safe guard your privacy and welfare. You can go the extra step to inform us of such people. Gushcloud Inc is very strict with regards to violating our terms and conditions, thus will be strictly dealt with. You can do your part to make Gushcloud a safe environment by informing us at _feedback@gushcloud.com_

## When you choose to share your information with marketers.

You may choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers that are not associated with Gushcloud through on-site offers. This is entirely at your discretion and we will not provide your information to these marketers without your consent.

## To help improve or promote our service.

Sometimes we share aggregated information with third parties to help improve or promote our service. But we only do so in such a way that no individual user can be identified or linked to any specific action or information.

## To provide you with services.

We may provide information to service providers that help us bring you the services we offer. For example, we may use third parties to help host our website, send out email updates about Gushcloud, remove repetitive information from our user lists, process payments, or provide search results or links. These service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service.

## To offer joint services.

We may provide services jointly with other companies, such as the classifieds service in the Gushcloud Marketplace. If you use these services, we may share your information to facilitate that service. However, we will identify the partner and present the joint service provider's privacy policy to you before you use that service.

## To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.

We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including criminal and civil matters) if we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.

## Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control.

If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.

## Deactivating or deleting your account.

If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete it. When you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be deleted. We save your profile information (connections, photos, etc.) in case you later decide to reactivate your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so are asking us to maintain their information until they return to Gushcloud. You will still have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from Gushcloud. You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it.

## Limitations on removal.

Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your discoverability, or it was copied or stored by other users. However, your name will no longer be associated with that information on Gushcloud. (For example, if you post something to another user's profile and then you delete your account, that post may remain, but be attributed to an "Anonymous Gushcloud User.") Additionally, we may retain certain information to prevent identity theft and other misconduct even if deletion has been requested. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your information, they may retain your information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies. But they will no longer be able to access the information through our Platform after you disconnect from them.

## Backup copies.

Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 90 days, but will not be available to others.

## Non-user contact information.

If a user provides your email address to us, and you are not a Gushcloud user but you want us to delete your address. However, that request will only apply to addresses we have at the time of the request and not to any addresses that users provide to us later.

## Steps we take to keep your information secure.

We do our best to keep your information secure, but we need your help.

We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and passwords), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use automated and social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and may suspend or disable accounts.

## Risks inherent in sharing information.

Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on Gushcloud will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on Gushcloud. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.
