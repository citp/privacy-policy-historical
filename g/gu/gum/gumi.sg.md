**PRIVACY POLICY**

 **(Effective Date: May 16, 2016)**

gumi Asia Pte. Ltd. (“Company,” “we”, “us” or “our”) maintains this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) that summarizes the treatment of information provided or collected on the sites and in connection with our various services (collectively, the “Services”) where this Privacy Policy is made available to you, including, without limitation: (1) our website(s) (our “Sites”), and (2) our applications and related services for Mobile Devices (defined below), including those accessible through third party social networking sites or platforms (“SNS”) (collectively, the “Applications”).

By accepting our Privacy Policy and the applicable Terms of Service you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

###  **A. Types and Collection of Information**

Our primary goal in collecting the information described below is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our Service and to deliver better service, products, and more relevant content to our customers, prospective customers, and visitors.

  1.  ** _Types of Information We Collect_**



We collect three basic types of information in connection with our Service: (a) Personal Information; (b) Anonymous Information; and (c) Aggregated Information. Personal Information, Anonymous Information and Aggregated Information as used in this Privacy Policy are defined below:

“Personal Information” means information that identifies (whether directly or indirectly) a particular individual, such as the individual’s first and last name, home or other physical address, email address, telephone number. Personal Information also includes identifiers, such as cookies, IP addresses and Mobile Device IDs that recognize individuals over time and across different websites or online services, where those identifiers can be reasonably linked to an identifiable individual.

“Anonymous Information” means information that does not directly or indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual person. When Anonymous Information is directly or indirectly associated with or combined with any Personal Information, such Anonymous Information will also be treated as Personal Information.

“Aggregated Information” means information about groups or categories of persons, which does not identify and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual person.

  2.  ** _How We Collect Your Information_**



 **Information Collected Directly From You**

When you use the Service, we collect information (including Personal Information) you provide to us directly as described below:

When you access the Service (during the registration process or otherwise) through your mobile telephone or other mobile devices (collectively, “Mobile Device”), we may collect: (i) Mobile Device type and manufacturer; (ii) mobile carrier; (iii) Mobile Device identifiers or advertising identifiers (“Device ID”); (iv) telephone number; (v) Internet Protocol address; (vi) geographic location/country/zip code; (vii) platform version; (viii) installation, navigation, access, interaction, impression and engagement information; (ix) network connection type (3G, 4G, WiFi, etc.); (x) browser type; (xi) Mac address; (xii) iOS advertiser ID; (xiii) user ID and (xiv) such other information you voluntarily provide to us. In addition, we collect information you provide when you sign up to have Short Message Service notifications sent directly to your Mobile Device. We use your Device ID to verify, audit and analyze your use of the Services. Please note that the Device ID alone does not constitute Personal Information.

Such information may include: (i) your first and last name; (ii) your valid e-mail address; (iii) credit and debit card numbers, PayPal account information, bank account and wire transfer information and other third party payment processor information; (iv) billing address; and (v) such other information you choose to provide. We may also receive your payment and billing information that you provide when your purchase is processed by another party, such as an SNS, third party platform (e.g., iTunes Store or Google Play) or third party payment vendors. Please note that payments handled through a third party payment processing service provider and Personal Information disclosed in connection therewith will be subject to the applicable privacy policies of such service provider. This Privacy Policy DOES NOT address the collection and use of your Personal Information by such service providers. Moreover, the purchase of third party credits or currencies such as Facebook Credits may also be subject to additional third party privacy policies.

Customer Service and Technical Support. When you communicate with us in connection with customer service and technical support, we will collect and store your contact information (including, without limitation, name, telephone number and email address), information about your use of the Service, your user ID and such other information you voluntarily provide to us in connection with such inquiry.

Profile Information. We provide areas on our Service where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload content such as photographs. Such postings are governed by our applicable Terms of Service. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or services, or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose Personal Information on publicly-viewable areas, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your Personal Information.

Information Received from SNS and APIs. When you access an Application through an SNS, you allow us to access and obtain certain information from your profile through such SNS and the applicable SNS platform Application Programming Interface (“API”). The information we receive varies by the Application and by the privacy settings you choose for the SNS and may include Personal Information, including, without limitation, the following, as allowed by you, the SNS and your privacy preferences: (i) your first and last name; (ii) your profile picture or its URL; (iii) your user ID number; which is linked to publicly available information such as name and profile photo; (iv) the user ID numbers for your friends that are also connected to our Application(s); (v) login e-mail you provided to the SNS when you registered; (vi) your physical location and that of your access device(s) (vii) your password; and (viii) your gender. By using our Application(s) through an SNS, you are authorizing us to collect, store and use/disclose any and all information you agreed the SNS could disclose to us through the API, including Personal Information, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Information Disclosed on Forums. You may also choose to disclose information in our chat rooms, diaries, communities, blogs, web forums, message boards or other public forms in Applications and our Sites (collectively, the “Forums”). You acknowledge and agree that information you disclose in such Forums is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality. If you access our Services from an SNS, you should also read that social network’s terms of service and privacy policy. If you are unclear about what information an SNS is sharing with us, please go to the SNS where you access our Service to find out more about their privacy settings.

Employment Opportunities. Parts of our Service may relate to employment opportunities. They usually will be captioned “Career,” “Job Opening” or other similar labels or captions clearly indicating the employment opportunity subject matter (the “Career Pages”). We will collect employment-related information that you submit to us, including through Careers Pages.

Other Sources. We may collect your information from other sources, including, without limitation, other users of the Service and third party information providers and partners. For example, we collect information you provide to us or third party partners when you enter any promotions, sweepstakes and loyalty program. Such information may be used to supplement your account information and/or profile and may be combined with other information we collect from you.

 ** _Information Collected by Automated Technologies_**

When you interact with the Service, we collect Anonymous Information through automated technologies as described below:

Cookies. A “cookie” is a small text file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive or Mobile Device. We may use cookies to track Anonymous Information about our users (e.g., user name, pages viewed, time spent on our Site(s), games, and the sites visited just before and just after our Service) for statistical and market research purposes.

We use cookies to gather information about our users’ browser activities. We may also use local shared objects also known as “flash cookies” to collect information from you.

You have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the option to reject all cookies, or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently from browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies. To learn more about and manage flash cookies please go to the following: <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html> Rejecting or limiting the type of cookies may, however, in limited instances prevent you from accessing certain features on our Service.

Log Files. Like most Internet services, we may also use log files on the server side to collect information from you. Your information held in log files includes your computer’s or Mobile Device’s IP (Internet Protocol) address, browser type, browser language, e-mail application, Internet service provider, referring/exit Web pages, computer platform type, date/time stamp, and user activity. The software enabling our Services has associated log and temporary files that are stored on our servers. These files store your account information, preference settings, system notifications as well as other data necessary to enable you to use our Service. Your information may also be collected in connection with regularly performed server backups.

Tracking Technologies. We use a variety of tracking methods to collect information from you, including, without limitation web beacons (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites to analyze the traffic patterns, such as the frequency users visit various areas of our Services. Pixel tags may allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation. These methods may involve collecting information directly from you or through another entity authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether the recipients have opened those e-mails or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information that we collect through tracking technologies is Anonymous Information.

Third Party Advertisers. Many advertisements are managed and placed on the Service by third parties. These third party advertisers may use cookies, web beacons or similar automated information collection technologies on your computer or Mobile Devices to collect Anonymous Information from you. In some cases, we may have access to information from cookies, web beacons and similar automated information collection technologies used by third party advertisers on our Services and this information may permit us to identify other sites or services that you have visited that are also associated with the third party advertiser.

The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar automated information collection technologies by third party advertisers is subject to their own privacy policies. Once you have clicked on an advertisement and have left the Service, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the applicable third party advertiser to see how your information will be collected, stored and used as part of their service. Specifically privacy choices you have made on the third party site or platform will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly from you or through our automated technologies.

Click Through URLs. Some of our Services, including email messages, use “click-through URLs” linked to other content on our Services. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in topics and use of the Services.

To prevent unauthorized access, loss, or misuse, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we maintain.

Although we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our Service, databases, equipment or servers, and records, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other security breaches and factors beyond our control will never take place and result in disclosure of your Personal Information.

We strongly urge you to take reasonable measures at all times (online and offline) to protect your Personal Information, including your password and other sensitive information.
