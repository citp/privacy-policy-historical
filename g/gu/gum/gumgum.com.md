Other Disclosures with or without Your Consent.  We may disclose your personal information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process, or to comply with relevant laws.

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal information and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal information for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. 

##   
9\. Data Security

  
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

  
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach.  In the event that we are required by law to inform you of any unauthorized access to your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or if permitted by law, by telephone. We will also notify any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.  
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. 

  
Some of our websites permit you to create an account. When you do you will be prompted to create a password.

We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including the fulfillment of the contract, the initiation of a contract, or for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or other regulatory reporting requirements.

  
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

##   
11\. International Transfers

  
If you are based in the European Union please note that we share your personal information with other GumGum entities outside of the European Union which means we may transfer your information outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

  
Many of our external third parties are also based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal information may involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

  
Whenever we transfer your personal information out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to you by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal information the same protection it has in Europe. 
  * Where we use providers based in the U.S., we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal information shared between Europe and the U.S. 



##   
12\. EUROPEAN UNION RESIDENTS: YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS

If you are based in the European Union please note that the laws in the EU (including all EU member states) will change on 25 May 2018. Although this Privacy Policy sets out most of your rights under the new laws, we may not be able to respond to some of your requests (for example, a request for the transfer of your personal information) until May 2018 as we are still working towards getting our systems ready for some of these changes.

  It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during your relationship with us.

  If you are accessing this website from the European Union, please note that under EU data protection laws you have the right to:

  * Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
  * Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
  * Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
  * Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
  * Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
  * Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. 
  * Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.



If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at [gdpr@gumgum.com](mailto:gdpr@gumgum.com). 

##   
13\. No Charge/Fees (in most cases)

  
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

##   
14\. What We May Need From You

  
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any other right). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

##   
15\. Time Limit To Respond

  
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within thirty (30) days.  Occasionally it may take us longer to process your request if it is particularly complex or if you have made multiple requests.  In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated on the status of your request(s).

##   
16\. Your Right to File a Complaint

If you are based in the European Union you also have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues ([www.ico.org.uk](http://www.ico.org.uk/)).
