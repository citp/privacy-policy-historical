** GIA takes privacy seriously, including the privacy of children and consequently insists that all Site users are 13 years old or older.

GIA does not seek to collect Personal Information about children through our Site.

If we become aware that a person submitting Personal Information to us through any part of the Site is a child, we delete such Personal Information as soon as reasonably practical after we discover it and do not, after such discovery, use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties.

Since we do not seek to collect any Personal Information about children, and we delete any such Personal Information collected inadvertently as soon as we discover that a child has submitted it, we typically retain no information about children that could be reviewed or deleted. If a parent requests review or deletion of Personal Information about their child before we have discovered and deleted such information, then we will, of course, honor that request.
