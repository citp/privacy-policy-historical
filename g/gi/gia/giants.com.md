We have worked with certain third-party social media providers to offer you their social networking services through our Services.  For example, you can use third-party social networking services, including but not limited to Facebook, Google+, and others to share information about your experience on our Services with your friends and followers on those social networking services.  These social networking services may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on our Services.  These third-party social networking services also may notify your friends, both on our Services and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of our Services or about your use of our Services, in accordance with applicable law and their own privacy policies.  If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services, including information about your contacts on those social networking services.

You also may be able to link an account from a social networking service (e.g., Facebook, Google+, Yahoo!) to an account through our Services.  This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign in to certain features on our Services.  If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Policy.

In some instances such as within our Mobile Application and certain parts of our site if you leave a comment within the community forum on our site, you must login to your Facebook account to do so.  The Giants are not responsible for any personal information you wish to post here.  If you wish to remove any personal information that you may have posted, please contact Facebook directly to request deletion of such information.

The Services may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under the control of or maintained by us.  Such links do not constitute an endorsement by us of those other websites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to this third-party content.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites or services.

 **SECURITY**

We have adopted security procedures to help protect against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access to the information you provide to us.  For example, if we collect financial information, we will use encryption software to help protect this information when it is in transit. Please note, however, that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to the Services and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information.

When you enter or we collect sensitive information (such as geo-location), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) so long as there is no interference from malicious third party code that may interfere with encryption.

 **CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**

The Services do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13, except as permitted by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).   If we are made aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 years old in a manner that is inconsistent with COPPA, we will delete this information as soon as possible.

 **CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY**

We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Your continued use of the Services after any modification to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of the new terms. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on the Services prior to the change becoming effective.  We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

You may opt-out from receiving push notifications, by changing your settings at the device level.  Please note that opt-out requests may take some time to be effective.  Your opt-out request will not apply to messages that you request or that are not commercial in nature.  For example, we may contact you concerning any purchases you have made with us, even if you opt out of receiving unsolicited commercial email messages.

If your information changes,  if you no longer desire to use the Services, or wish to request that we remove information from our blog or community forum, you may request that we update delete inaccuracies, remove certain information by signing into your account and making the required changes, by emailing our Customer Support at Shah@Giants.NFL.net, or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.  We will try to respond to your request within 30 days.  In some instances we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why; for example, if you are a Giants season ticket holder and wish to continue using online access to your account, we may not be able to make changes unless you are willing to discontinue use of the Giants App.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

 **YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to Shah@Giants.NFL.net or write us at New York Football Giants, Inc., Quest Diagnostics Training Center, 1925 Giants Drive, East Rutherford, NJ 07073, ATTENTION:  Nilay Shah, Director of Digital and Social Media.

In some cases, third parties may be able to collect information about a user’s online activities over time and across different websites when he or she uses our Services.

Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates.  Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.  Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, we currently do not take action in response to these signals.  If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.

 **INTERNATIONAL USERS** Please note that the Services are directed towards users who reside in the United States. By using the Services, you consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information in and to the United States, or other countries and territories, pursuant to the laws of the United States.  While some of these countries may not offer the same level of privacy protection as your own, we commit to uphold the privacy protections as explained in this Policy.
