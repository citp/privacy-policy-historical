# Giant Tiger - Privacy Policy

## Effective February 2011

Giant Tiger Stores Limited is committed to protecting your privacy and safeguarding your personal information. This includes all personal information acquired through our contests and/or promotions or through interactions with our Internet sites. 

This privacy policy will outline how we collect, use and retain your personal information.

### Your Consent To This Policy

By accessing this website and/or participating in one of our contests/promotions, you (as well as your parent or legal guardian, if applicable) acknowledge and accept these terms and conditions of use.

### Personal Information

Personal information may include your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. You may happen to provide us with such information through resources such as regular mail, our on-line application form or via our email addresses. In all cases, we will take steps to ensure that the information is handled securely. These steps are taken in order to comply with legislative requirements, such as those contained in the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Document Act.

### Collecting, Using and Protecting your Information

Information is only collected with your consent, and will be used for the sole purpose that is stipulated at the time the information is gathered. Your consent is deemed to be given when you send information to us through the internet. Giant Tiger does not sell or share customer information with any other organization or person for any reason, unless required by law.

The information sent to Giant Tiger is kept confidential and secure and only for the duration it is needed. We have in place safeguards to protect the information we receive to ensure that the information is protected from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. These safeguards take the shape of locked filing cabinets in areas with limited access, the use of ID's and passwords limiting access to electronic files, and restricting access to authorized personnel only.

### Accuracy of Personal Information

For the most part, we collect personal information that is directly supplied by you. We will therefore assume the information you have provided us with is accurate. We will not make additional efforts to verify its accuracy or to update the information unless requested by you. Customers and/or applicants may request in writing access to their personal information; to do so please write to the address indicated below. Any information we have on record will be provided to you. You may at that time put in a request for your information to be updated to ensure its accuracy.

### Non-Personal Information Collected Automatically

We do not require your personal information in order for you to access this website. We may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable such as the type of internet browser or computer operating system you are using and the domain name of the website from which you linked to our site. In addition, when you view our websites, we may store some information on your computer in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookies allow us to tailor a website or promotion to better match your interests and preferences. Most Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. Giant Tiger does not collect your personal information automatically, but we may tie the information that we do collect automatically (such as the type of internet browser that you use) to your previously submitted personal information.
