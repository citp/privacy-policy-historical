## GIANT EAGLE® PRIVACY POLICY

Your privacy is important to Giant Eagle® and we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we may acquire about you, our customer, and how we may use it. When you use your Giant Eagle Advantage Card® or give us Information via this Web site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy. We may revise this Policy without prior notice. You can find out when this Policy was last revised by referring to the _“LAST UPDATED”_ legend at the end of the Policy.

This Web site is controlled by Giant Eagle® in the United States and is subject to its laws.

  1. **What Kind of Information is Collected About You?**
    1. The Giant Eagle Advantage Card®. In order to provide you with the benefits of the Giant Eagle Advantage Card® program (including the accrual and use of fuelperks!® and foodperks™!), Giant Eagle® must obtain certain information including your name and address, your record of purchases, and other information that you may elect to give (“Information”). You voluntarily provided some of this Information when you applied for your Giant Eagle Advantage Card® and the Information is supplemented each time you use the Card. Giant Eagle® collects and retains this Information whether or not you register on or use this Web site. You may elect to register your Card at the Web site which will make this Information accessible to you through the Web site.

Your Giant Eagle Advantage Card® number is not personally identifiable Information unless it is accompanied by your name, address, social security number or password.

    2. The Web site. In order to obtain certain services on this Website, you must register with the site and provide information that personally identifies you or permits us to contact you. This includes your name, address and other preferences. (For the purposes of this Policy, “Information” includes personally identifiable Information acquired both through your registration on the website and obtained directly through your use of the Giant Eagle Advantage Card®).

You may also provide Information when you register for a contest or purchase products from our Web site. Giant Eagle® also may offer certain promotions to you (such as fuelperks!® or coupons) if you make purchases from third party vendors who are linked through our website. Giant Eagle® does not receive any information about your activities at that vendor’s site except when you make a qualifying purchase. In that case, Giant Eagle® receives information identifying the name of the merchant, the category of the product, the total sale amount and numerical data that allow us to give you credit for the promotion we are offering, as well as your e-mail notice preferences for that promotion.

You may browse our site without registering; in that case, your visit will remain anonymous. If you choose not to register or provide Information, you can still view most of our site, with the exception of those areas that require registration.

    3. Information from Other Contacts: We may collect Information about you in other ways not specified here. For example, we may collect Information through your contacts with our Customer Service Line or from a direct contact with an employee in our stores or any source available to the public.
    4. Non-Personally Identifiable Information. When you visit and interact with the Web site, Giant Eagle® and third parties who provide services to Giant Eagle® collect general information that does not specifically identify you. This includes server log files, environmental variables and pixel tags. Collecting this kind of information is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.

We and our service providers may also use “cookies” on the Site. A cookie is a piece of data that a web server stores on your hard drive. Cookies are standard in Internet use and help you to navigate in a Web site that you have visited before; they do not harm your computer. If you do not want cookies placed on your computer, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allow you to automatically decline them. If you decline cookies, you may not be able to use some features of our Site.

  2. **What Does Giant Eagle ® Do With Information?**

  3. **Is the Information Secure?**

Giant Eagle® understands that using the Internet may cause concerns. This is why we take special steps to protect your privacy. The Information we acquire from you is encrypted while it is in transit from your computer to ours. At Giant Eagle®, your Information is stored on our secure server, and we have security procedures in place to permit access by only a limited number of authorized employees and service providers for limited purposes. Anyone attempting to get access from outside the organization, including you, must have a user name and password. We employ “firewalls”, Intrusion Prevention Systems and other security devices on our servers to prevent unauthorized computer access from outside. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect Information, we cannot insure or warrant confidentiality of Information.

Giant Eagle® may use the Information offered for posting as information that is available to the general public and accepts no duty of privacy as to its content.
    3. Promotions, Contests, Advertisers. We reserve the right to acquire or retain Information you may give to the sponsors of promotions and contests entered on this site.
