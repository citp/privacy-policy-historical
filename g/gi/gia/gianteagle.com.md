When you use your Giant Eagle Advantage Card®, your Market District Advantage Card™ or your GetGo Advantage Card™ (collectively, the “Advantage Card”), or give us information via any of our Sites, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. We may revise this Privacy Policy without prior notice. You can find out when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the "LAST UPDATED" legend at the end of the policy. This Privacy Policy also applies to any of our other websites and/or apps that post and/or link to this Privacy Policy. It does not apply to third party websites and/or apps that post different statements addressing users’ privacy. Our Sites are controlled by Giant Eagle in the United States and are subject to its laws. 

**What Kind of Information is Collected About You?**

  * _The Advantage Card._ In order to provide you with the benefits of the Advantage Card program (including the accrual and use of **_fuelperks! ®_**, where available), Giant Eagle must obtain certain information including your name and address, your record of purchases, and other information that you may elect to give. You voluntarily provided some of this information when you applied for your Advantage Card and the Information is supplemented each time you use the Advantage Card. Giant Eagle collects and retains this information whether or not you register on or use any of our Sites. You may elect to register your Card on certain of our Sites which will make this information accessible to you through our Sites. 

Personally identifiable information means any information by which you can be identified or contacted, such as your name (first and last), address (city, state, zip), email address, date of birth, telephone number, etc. Your Advantage Card number is not personally identifiable information unless it is accompanied by your name, address, social security number or password. 

  * _Information You Provide._ We collect information you provide at various times: 
    * _Registration Information._ In order to obtain certain services on any of our Sites, you must register with the site or app and provide information that personally identifies you or permits us to contact you. This includes your name, address, date of birth and certain preferences. You may also provide information when you register for a contest or purchase products from our Website or through links accessed through our Sites. You may browse our Sites without registering; in that case, your visit will remain anonymous unless you otherwise provide personal information during your visit. If you choose not to register or provide information, you can still view most of our Sites, with the exception of those areas that require registration. Note, however, that especially with our apps, the features of the Sites available to an unregistered user may be significantly limited. 
    * _Communications, Support Requests._ If you contact us for assistance or to report a problem, or other issue through and/or regarding any of our Sites, we may collect and store your contact information, communication, and/or other information about you, including but not limited to your name, e-mail address, user name, location, and other information, and we reserve the right to conduct further research and obtain further information as necessary. We will use the information to respond to you, research your request/communication, and for other purposes in accordance with provisions of this Privacy Policy.
    * _Sweepstakes, Promotions, and Surveys._ From time to time, we may ask you to complete a survey, and/or offer you the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes or other promotion through our Sites, or through a third party platform. If you choose to participate in a such a promotion or survey, we will collect, store, use, and disclose the information you provide in accordance with this Privacy Policy unless stated otherwise, such as in the official rules (or other guidelines) of the promotion or as stated in another privacy policy that may govern that promotion. Your information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes and/or in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your entry in the promotion may also result in your being added to our mailing lists as well as those of our promotional partners associated with the contest or sweepstakes. Acceptance of a prize may require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on any of our Sites, such as on a winner’s page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. In some instances, a third-party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a promotion on or through our Sites, and collect your information. In those cases, where we are not the sponsor or operator of the promotion, we have no control over the information collected and you should review the official rules as well as the advertiser’s or sponsor’s privacy policy applicable to the promotion before participating.
    * _Shared Content._ Some of our Sites and services may now or in the future allow you to interact with other users and/or post, share, communicate with, or otherwise transmit content publicly, such as by posting comments and other information (collectively “Shared Content”). We may collect and store archives of such Shared Content on our servers, and all Shared Content is subject to this Privacy Policy and may be used or disclosed pursuant to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, including but not limited to protecting the safety and well being of members of the public, minors, our users, our team members, and our Sites and services. Keep in mind that your Shared Content could be visible to anyone who has access to our Sites. Your user name as well as other profile information may be displayed in conjunction with your Shared Content. Thus, those accessing this information may be able to identify you. Giant Eagle may use the information offered for posting as information that is free and available to the general public and accepts no duty of privacy as to its content.

We may use third party vendors whose websites will use these cookies in order to provide you with targeted ads that match your interests. For example, if you visit those vendor websites, you may see ads for the Giant Eagle Businesses or for products you saw on our Sites. If you do not want cookies placed on your computer, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline them (for example, at Google, follow [www.google.com/settings/ads](http://www.google.com/settings/ads)).

In addition, we or our service providers may use local shared objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and how you interact with our websites and mobile applications.

We may also link this information with other personal information about you and may use this linked information to allow third parties to serve ads on our websites or mobile applications or to serve our ads to you on a third party’s website. If you “click through” to or otherwise visit third-party websites, they may also collect information about you and your visit. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, the practices of third parties that collect your personal information.

**What Does Giant Eagle Do With Information?**

  * _Sharing Information with Third Parties_
    * The Giant Eagle Businesses may disclose information to service providers and nonaffiliated third parties in certain circumstances: 
      * In order to provide you with services or information that you request or benefits for which you are eligible as our customer;
      * To complete a transaction you have authorized;
      * If required to do so by law; in response to a specific law enforcement request; to comply with legal process; if necessary to protect the rights, privacy, property, security or safety of the Giant Eagle Businesses, our team members or customers; to assist in the detection, prevention or prosecution of a crime or fraud; or in cases of emergency regarding matters of personal or public safety; and
      * In order to enforce our rights in contracts or transactions that you participate in with us. 
    * We may transfer information to an affiliated entity or to a third party in the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of the Giant Eagle’s Businesses, assets or stock. We may disclose information to a prospective buyer or business partner pursuant to appropriate confidentiality agreement. 
    * We may make information available to third parties who analyze and collect information for the Giant Eagle Businesses so that we can offer you goods, services and opportunities. The third parties may not use the information for their own benefit or for any other purpose. 
    * The Giant Eagle Businesses may share your name and address with financial institutions that we partner with to jointly create and offer a product such as the Giant Eagle private label credit card. These cards are subject to their own privacy policies referenced in the separate Cardholder Agreement. 
    * If your Advantage Card is owned jointly with another person, we will disclose your shopping history to the other person(s) on the account, if requested.
    * If you pay with check, credit or debit card, the Giant Eagle Businesses, like most retailers, compare your account number against one or more third party databases to check for problems. To the extent permitted by law, the Giant Eagle Businesses may keep a record of check or credit problems and may share those account numbers with third parties who share their information with the Giant Eagle Businesses. 
  * _Aggregated Information._ The Giant Eagle Businesses also collect, store and use aggregate sales and customer data. This information may be acquired through the Advantage Card database, from users of any of our Sites, or from other sources such as contests, promotions or community events. It may be shared with or sold to third parties for any purpose. This information is in summary form and is not personally identifiable to you. 
  * _To Improve Our Service._ Giant Eagle may share or use information within the Giant Eagle Businesses and independent Giant Eagle retailers. 



**Information Choices and Changes.** When you register on our Sites, you can choose the kind of information you want to receive by email. If you do not wish to receive email communications, please modify your preferences in your account settings or opt-out by following the opt-out instructions on the email you received. If you opt-out, we may still send you non-marketing emails. Non-marketing emails include emails about your accounts and our business dealings with you. You may send requests about personal information to our Contact information below. You can request to change contact choices and update your personal information.

**What about “Do Not Track”?** Because consumers are often unaware that their do-not-track beacons are active, do-not-track does not frequently reflect the actual preferences of our users. Accordingly, we do not respond to the federal Do-Not-Track signal. If you would like to receive no promotional communications, you are free to follow the procedures in this Privacy Policy, on our Sites, and/or in such communications to unsubscribe.

**Is the Information Secure?** The Giant Eagle Businesses understand that using the Internet and mobile applications may cause concerns. This is why we take special steps to protect your privacy. The information we acquire from you is encrypted while it is in transit from your computer to ours. At the Giant Eagle Businesses, your information is stored on our secure server, and we have security procedures in place to permit access by only a limited number of authorized employees and service providers for limited purposes. Anyone attempting to get access from outside the organization, including you, must have a user name and password. We employ “firewalls”, Intrusion Prevention Systems and other security devices on our servers to prevent unauthorized computer access from outside. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect information, we cannot insure or warrant confidentiality of information.

  * **Information You May Provide to Others From Our Site.**

    * _Links to Other Sites._ Our site may contain links to other sites. Other sites may also reference or link to our site. The Giant Eagle Businesses are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other sites.

    * _Information Sent at your Request._ Some parts of the Website may permit you to e-mail or forward content or information to others. If you utilize this service, we may retain and use the e-mail address and other information about the transfer as described in this policy.



**Access by Children?** Our Sites are not directed towards children under 13 years of age and we request that children under 13 do not provide information about themselves.

**Contact Us.** We welcome your comments or questions about this Policy. You may contact us through any of our Sites that include. “Contact Us” feature, through our Customer Service phone number, and/or by mail at our address for any reason.
