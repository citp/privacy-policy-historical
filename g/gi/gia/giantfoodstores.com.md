# GIANT® Food Stores

GIANT® Food Stores, (GIANT) believes in protecting the confidentiality of customer information in accordance with our customers' wishes and applicable laws. Our reason for collecting customer information is to help us deliver greater value and improve the shopping experience of our customers. The GIANT BonusCard is our primary means of collecting such information which helps us to target benefits and services to our customers. This may include advising our customers about products, services and other opportunities. 

GIANT values your business and the trust you place in us. To help you better understand how customer information is used and protected at GIANT, this Privacy Policy outlines (a) a definition of customer information, (b) methods and sources of collecting customer information, (c) categories of institutions or parties to whom we may disclose customer information, and (d) measures and efforts we take to safeguard customer information. 

**What is Customer Information?**

Customer Information is information about you that is obtained by GIANT in connection with providing a product or service for personal, family or household purposes. Some Customer Information is general and not specifically about you. For example, we may collect and use aggregate sales information or purchase data to determine purchasing trends. Because this aggregated information cannot be linked to any individual, it is not protected by this policy. 

Customer Information also includes Customer Identifiable Information. This is information that identifies you. It includes your name, address, email address, and telephone number. If you elect to have check cashing privileges at our stores, it may also include your social security number, checking account number and/or driver's license number.

This privacy policy does not include GIANT pharmacy records. Pharmacy records are kept separate from other Customer Information and maintained in accordance with the privacy and other requirements of Federal and state law. Please speak to your pharmacist for additional information.

To help better understand and serve the needs of our customers, we collect Customer Information from various sources, including the following:

We may also provide Customer Identifiable Information to marketing services providers that perform services for us, such as sending a direct mail offer from us to you. We require these companies to sign a confidentiality agreement that prohibits them from using the information for their own purpose and from disclosing the information to anyone else. 

In addition, GIANT may disclose Customer Identifiable Information as required by law, as required to protect the rights or safety of GIANT or our customers, or in response to a specific law enforcement request.
