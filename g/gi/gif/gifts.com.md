gifts.com adheres to the highest standards in our customers' privacy. All information (including customer accounts, transactions, and all correspondence), is handled with the utmost discretion.

gifts.com is a division of gifts.com, Inc. The policies below are applicable to gifts.com and/or its affiliates, licensors or assigns (collectively "gifts.com"). 

**Collection of Personal Information**  
The only personal information collected by gifts.com through our web site is information which is submitted to us voluntarily and knowingly by site visitors. When you simply browse our sites, no personal information is collected by gifts.com.

Some functions and services offered through our site require that you provide certain personal information, for example, when you order a product, enter a contest or sweepstakes, or register for a mailing list, we may need your postal or e-mail address. 

**Receiving E-mail and Postal Correspondence**  
Our online registration forms contain a clearly identified checkbox that indicates that by submitting the form you will be entitled to receive e-mail correspondence from gifts.com, Reader's Digest, and our affiliates and partners unless you opt out of being including in our mailing list. Web site visitors over the age of 18 who have submitted their names, mailing addresses, or e-mail addresses and have not opted out, may occasionally receive e-mail correspondence from gifts.com, Reader's Digest, and our affiliates and partners such as newsletters or special offers. Our purpose is to provide visitors with useful information and offers that will interest them.

gifts.com will consider permission granted to send such information if a form is submitted with a check mark in the box labeled "by checking this box, you will be entitled to receive special offers, discounts, privileges and other benefits via e-mail from Reader's Digest, its affiliates and partners. If you do not wish to receive these offers, please uncheck this box." 

gifts.com will not share e-mail addresses and postal addresses we collect through our Web sites with any unaffiliated third parties.

**Opting Out**  
Receiving email messages from gifts.com, our affiliates and partners is optional.

You may choose not to receive e-mail, even after granting prior permission, or you may wish to correct information you previously provided. If you do not wish to receive e-mail or wish to correct information you provided to gifts.com, please send an e-mail message to [info@gifts.com](mailto:info@gifts.com).

gifts.com will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete records from our database when we receive requests to do so; however because of possible retention of a residual copy in a system backup file, we cannot guarantee deletion in every instance.
