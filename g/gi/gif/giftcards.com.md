### Privacy Policy

**GiftCards.com™, Inc.** (GCI) will not share your nonpublic personal information with others as defined below. **GCI** , on your behalf, has exercised your right to opt-out under 12 CFR Part 40, Privacy of Consumer Financial Information.

The basis of each customer relationship at **GCI** is built on trust. You have chosen to do business with **GCI** , and we guard that relationship with great care, beginning with the information you have chosen to share with us. **That is why we have opted out for you as a matter of corporate policy. GCI does not share information about you outside of our GCI companies unless permitted by Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and other applicable laws and regulations.**

**GCI** , its family of technology services companies ("affiliates") and employees, are dedicated to protecting the privacy of your nonpublic personal information. We maintain information about you in order to provide you with the most effective and convenient access to our broad range of financial products and services. We want you to understand what information we collect, and how we use and protect it. This notice serves as a standard for all **GCI** employees for collection, use, retention and security of nonpublic personal consumer information.

**What information we collect**   
"Nonpublic personal information" is information about you that we obtain in connection with providing a financial product or service. Such information includes for example, account balance, income, assets, insurance premiums, payment history and overdraft history.

We may collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:

  * Information that you provide to us, such as on applications or other forms 
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others, or
  * Information from others, such as credit bureaus, real estate appraisers, and employers



**Our security procedures**   
To maintain security of customer information, we restrict access to your personal and account information to persons who need to know that information to provide you products or services. We maintain electronic and procedural safeguards to guard information. 

**What information we disclose**   
**GCI** does not disclose nonpublic personal information about you to any companies that are not members of our corporate family ("third parties"), except as permitted by federal law, specifically Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. The confidentiality of your nonpublic personal information will continue to be maintained consistent with this privacy notice even if you decide to close your account(s), your account becomes inactive, or when you otherwise cease to do business with us. 

We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to third parties that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions, such as insurance providers, with whom we have joint marketing agreements in order to make a variety of financial services available to you. These third parties must agree to strict confidentiality provisions to assure the protection of your information. Because we already limit the sharing of your nonpublic personal information as outlined above, no action is necessary on your part to limit such sharing. 

**GCI's pledge to you**   
We believe that your privacy should never be compromised. At the same time, we want to offer you the array of financial products and services you need to accomplish your financial goals. We believe we can do both by adhering to the provisions of this privacy notice.

**GCI on privacy  
Frequently asked questions**

 **GCI** is dedicated to protecting the privacy of your nonpublic personal information. Federal law establishes rules for sharing customer information. We believe that your privacy should never be compromised. **GCI** 's privacy notice describes how we collect and use your nonpublic personal information. It will help you understand the careful attention we devote to handling and protecting your nonpublic personal information. 

Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about privacy to help you understand **GCI** 's position on this important issue.

**1\. Does the GCI Privacy Notice cover all my GCI accounts?**   
Yes, however, you may receive more than one copy of the notice from **GCI** if you have several accounts or do business with more than one **GCI** company. This helps us to ensure that all customers receive it. 

**2\. What is " _nonpublic personal information_ "?**   
_"Nonpublic personal information"_ is information about you that we obtain in connection with providing a financial product or service. For example, this might include information such as account balances, income, assets, and insurance premiums. Generally speaking, nonpublic personal information is information that is not available in public records. 

**3\. Do you sell information about me to other companies?**   
No. We will not sell information about you. We honor the trust that you have placed in **GCI** to keep information about you confidential.

**4\. Why does GCI share information about me with other GCI companies**?   
There are many benefits to sharing information within our **GCI** family of companies. These are just a few:

_Fraud Prevention_ \- Sharing information amongst **GCI** companies helps us to prevent fraud. Your accounts and your personal identity are better protected from thieves and imposters, and **GCI** is less vulnerable to losses from fraud. Consumer fraud is costly. Controlling it keeps your costs down. 

_Enhanced Service_ \- Sharing information enables us to provide you with superior service. For example, our Call Centers are able to serve you faster and more efficiently when they have access to all of your bank relationships and account information. You have the convenience of calling just one number to have most of your questions answered.

_Tailored Products and Services_ \- Knowledge of your account relationships, balances and transaction behavior helps us to identify what products and services may be most interesting to you. We use this information to keep you informed about those suited to you. It also helps us to identify and notify you when market conditions are favorable to you. For example, we can analyze the impact of lower interest rates on your mortgage and notify you when conditions are right for you to benefit financially from refinancing your home.

**5\. What if I believe that the personal information that GCI keeps on me is incorrect?**   
Please contact your **GCI** representative, branch office or call center if any of your information is incorrect or if any information changes, such as your name or address. **GCI** will research your concern and make any necessary corrections.
