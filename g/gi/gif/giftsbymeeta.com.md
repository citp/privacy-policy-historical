**Log Files**

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 

We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information.

We do not use cookies on this site. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. 

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**  
We do not use clear gifs (I.e. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) in our HTML-based emails. 

Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users and to let companies know which emails recipients have opened, allowing them to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of their on-line marketing campaigns. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

You will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it periodically. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
