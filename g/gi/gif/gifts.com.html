            </p><p><b>Information we collect about you</b></p>

                <p><b>In General.</b> We may collect personal information that can identify you such as your name and email address and other information that does not identify you.

                <p><b>Information you provide.</b> We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our website or provide to us in some other manner. This includes identifying information, such as your name and e-mail address. We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, your zip code and other demographic information.</p>

                <p><b>Information from other sources.</b> We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from business partners, contractors and other third parties. Examples of information that we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and additional demographic information.</p>

Gifts.com will not share the personal information you provide to us of your friends and family members with anyone, unless required by law, court order or to technically operate our website or service.</p>

                <p><b>Use of cookies and other technologies to collect information.</b> We use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our site.</p>

                <p><b>Information collected automatically.</b> We automatically collect information from your browser when you visit our website.

                <p><b>Cookies.</b> When you visit our website, we may assign your computer one or more <a href="#cookies">cookies</a>, to facilitate access to our site and to personalize your online experience.

The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer our website visitors to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities.</p>

                <p><b>Information collected by third-parties.</b> We may allow third-parties, including our authorized service providers, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as <a href="#cookies">cookies</a>, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="new">www.networkadvertising.org</a>).</p>

                <p><b>How we use the information we collect</b><br>
                In general. We may use information that we collect about you to:</p>

                    <li>Perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Please review "Your choices about collection and use of your information" below.</p>

                <p><b>With whom we share your information</b><br>
                We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities on our web site or while using our services.</p>

                <p><b>Personal information.</b> We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share personal information with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Authorized service providers:</b> We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our website. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but will not be permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.</li>
                    <li><b>Business partners:</b> When you make purchases, reservations or engage in promotions offered through our website or our services, we may share personal information with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes. When you elect to engage in a particular merchant's offer or program, you authorize us to provide your email address and other information to that merchant. We will always provide you with the opportunity not to share information with these businesses (see the <a href="#choices">Your choices about collection and use of information</a>).</li>
                    <li><b>Other Situations.</b> We also may disclose your information:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.</li>
                            <li>When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.</li>
                            <li>In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.</p>

                <p><b>Aggregated and non-personal information.</b> We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.</p>

                <p><b>Third-party websites</b><br>
                There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</p>

                <p><b>How you can access your information</b><br>
                If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account. You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us. More information about how to contact us is provided below.</p>

                <p>You also may choose to remove your account at any time by contacting us at the number below. After you close your account, you will not be able to sign in to our website or access any of your personal information. However, you can open a new account at any time. If you delete your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take action we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our web site or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.</p>
                
                <p><a name="choices"></a><b>Your choices about collection and use of your information</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; post a comment to a blog; or initiate other transactions on our website.</li>
                    <li>If you register on our website, you will be given the choice as to whether you want to receive email messages about special offers. You may modify your choice at any time on the My Account page, available through a link on the home page of our website. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>How we protect your personal information</b><br>
                We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.</p>

                <p>We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.

In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.</p>

When you sign in to your account on our website, we will record your user or account ID and the name on your user or member account in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of sites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our authorized service providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.</p>

                <p>You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click "Help" in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of our website may not function properly.</p>

                <p>We may allow third-parties, including advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party's privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="new">www.networkadvertising.org</a>).</p>

                Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>

                <p>Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.</p>

                <p class="bold">FAQs for Privacy Policy Changes</p>
                
                <p><b>Why has the privacy policy changed?</b><br>
                As of December 1, 2010, we are no longer part of the IAC/InterActiveCorp family of companies.  As of December 1, 2010, Gifts.com joined the Liberty Media family of companies (<a href="http://www.libertymedia.com" target="new">www.libertymedia.com</a>) and we have updated this Privacy Policy to reflect those changes.</p>

                <p><b>What changes have been made to the privacy policy?</b><br>
                No, our underlying practices have not changed. We have simply removed our association with the IAC businesses to reflect our current ownership structure.</p>

                <p><b>Who are the businesses in the Liberty Media family of companies?</b><br>
                A full list of the Liberty Media companies can be found at <a href="http://www.libertymedia.com" target="new">www.libertymedia.com.</a></p>

                <p><b>Do you/will you sell my personal information to third parties?</b><br>
                No, we wonÕt sell your personal information to third parties.  As described in our privacy policy, we may share your personal information with selected business partners with which we partner to provide you with special promotions, offers, sweepstakes, contests or other activities, when you elect to participate in those offers or promotions.  We may also share personal information in other limited circumstances, including to law enforcement, with your consent or after providing you with the option of not having such information shared.</p>

                <p><b>To whom does the updated privacy policy apply?</b><br>
                This updated privacy policy applies to all of our website visitors in the United States. It generally covers the personal information visitors provide to us on this website.</p>

                <p><b>When do revisions take effect?</b><br>
                The updated privacy policy is effective as of December 1, 2010.  It applies to personal information we collect from this date going forward.</p>

                <p><b>Will this updated policy apply to the information I have already provided to you?</b><br>
                No, the new provisions of this updated privacy policy will not apply to the personal information you have provided before December 1, 2010.  If at some time in the future we want to apply these changes to information we collected about you before this date, we will notify you and provide you with the opportunity to choose not to have the changes apply to that previously collected personal information.</p>

                <p><b>Can I see a copy of the prior privacy policy?</b><br>
                Yes, please <a href="/company/privacy-policy-old">click here</a> for a link to our previous privacy policy that applies to personal information collected before December 1, 2010.</p>
