### 7\. How do you ensure my data is secure?

giffgaff is committed to keeping your data secure. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.

More info

**Security of Communications**  
Please be aware that communications over the Internet, such as e-mails and webmails, are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may route through a number of countries before being delivered - this is the nature of the World Wide Web/Internet. giffgaff cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.

**giffgaff Blogs, Chat rooms and Forums**  
You are reminded that chat rooms and opinion forums are for public discussion. Any personal information that you choose to supply when you participate in these discussions is widely accessible. Never reveal any personal information such as your telephone number, postal or email address when you participate in these discussions.

**Users 13 and under**  
If you are aged 13 or under, please get your parent or guardian's permission before providing any personal information or before taking part in any www.giffgaff.com discussion. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information.

**Co-Branded Micro Sites and Third Party Sites**  
Some web pages and Micro Websites included within giffgaff's websites may be co-branded with third party names, logos, or properties. These Micro Websites are operated or maintained by or on behalf of giffgaff. While such third parties are sponsors of these web pages or Micro Websites, the third parties do not share in any personally identifiable information collected within those web pages or Micro Websites unless otherwise stated.

This policy does not apply to third party sites that you may access via our Portals. You should therefore ensure that you are familiar with the applicable third-party privacy policy before entering any personal information on a third party site.

This policy does not apply to third party sites operated by those promoting giffgaff, including Super Recruiters. Whilst giffgaff provides guidance to Super Recruiters in respect of their use and protection of personal data, giffgaff requires such third party sites to maintain a privacy policy. You should, therefore, review relevant policies to learn about how your personal data will be treated.

**Non-EEA Use of Information**  
The information you provide to us may be passed to third parties located outside the European Economic Area. Countries outside the European Economic Area do not always have strong data protection laws. However, we will always take steps to ensure that your information is used by third parties in accordance with this policy. This can be done in a number of different ways, for instance:

    * The country that we send the data to might be approved by the European Commission;
    * The recipient company might have signed up to a contract obliging them to protect your information; or;
    * The recipient is located in the US and is a certified member of the EU-US Privacy Shield scheme.



In other circumstances the law may permit us to otherwise transfer your information outside the EEA. In all cases, however, we will ensure that any transfer of your information is compliant with data protection law.

  * It is necessary for the **performance of the contract** with you or to take steps to enter into it. This includes verifying your identity, administering the agreement between us in accordance with our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.giffgaff.com/terms#giffgaff-gameplan-tc), to provide you with the Services, including analysing and reporting on your account and transaction data that we obtain from your bank, managing your account, communicating with you (for example, sending you important service related messages), providing updates on the status of your account (for example, we may contact you to ask you to refresh your consent for us to access your bank account information when your current consent is due to expire or we may notify you to warn you that your giffgaff account will be closed due to non-use), dealing with any complaints and notifying you of any changes to this statement or our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.giffgaff.com/terms#giffgaff-gameplan-tc).

[Top]

### 7\. Retention of your information

If we collect your personal information, the length of time we retain it is determined by a number of factors including the purpose for which we use that information and our obligations under other laws. We do not retain personal information in an identifiable format for longer than is necessary.

We may need your personal information to establish, bring or defend legal claims. For this purpose, we will always retain your personal information for 7 years after the date it is no longer needed by us for any of the purposes listed under section 4 “Use of your information”.

The only exceptions to this are where:

  * the law requires us to hold your personal information for a longer period, or delete it sooner
  * you exercise your right to have the information erased (where it applies) and we do not need to hold it in connection with any of the reasons permitted or required under the law (see further Erasing your personal information or restricting its processing)
  * in limited cases, the law permits us to keep your personal information indefinitely provided we put certain protections in place.



In relation to your bank account information, this is only retained by us in limited circumstances:

  * If you do not renew your consent and you do not revoke it, your consent will have lapsed. In this instance we will retain your bank account information for a period of 9 months after your consent has lapsed, before your bank account information will be immediately and permanently removed from our systems or anonymised (in the event you do not renew your consent before the end of this nine month period).
  * If you revoke your consent/remove your bank account on a given date (see final paragraph of section 4), we will not retain your bank account information for any longer than the given date (i.e. your bank account information will be immediately and permanently removed from our systems at the point of your revocation).
  * Provided you continue to renew your consent we will retain your bank account information for a period of 7 years, so for example, if you have continued to provide consent for a seamless period of 8 years, we will only retain your bank account information for the last 7 of those 8 years.

### 8\. Transfers to third countries/where we store your information

We store your information on servers located within the European Economic Area (EEA).

Your information may be transferred to a country outside of the EEA by us or any of the third parties referred to above. Where adequate protections for your information do not exist under the applicable laws of that third country, we (or the party transferring your information) will take necessary steps to ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place to maintain the same levels of protection as are needed under UK data protection legislation. Safeguards include imposing contractual obligations on the recipient of your information or subscription to ‘international frameworks’ that ensure adequate protection. Please contact our DPO for more information about the protections that are in place.

If you use our Services whilst you are outside of the EEA, your information may be transferred outside of the EEA in order to provide you with the Services.

Please note that, as we use Google Analytics, Google may transfer your information outside of the EEA and we recommend that you read Google’s privacy notice for further information. Google is registered with the Privacy Shield for transfers of personal data to the US.

### 10\. Marketing

When registering to receive the Services, we will ask you if you would like to give your consent to receive marketing information directly from us, and/or the third parties notified to you at the time of asking, for marketing purposes including, amongst other things, to identify and offer you further products, services and offers which we think might interest you.

We will only share your personal information with our recommended third party partners for them to contact you with marketing information about their products and services where you have indicated that you would like us to do so. Please use the link on the page requesting your consent to marketing to find out more about these third parties. Once shared, the relevant third party’s privacy policy will apply to their processing of your personal information, not ours. If you’d like to opt-out of receiving marketing from a third party after giving your consent, you can do so at any time by contacting the relevant third party directly.

You have the right to opt-out of our use of your personal information to send marketing to you. To withdraw your consent, please update your contact permissions in the “My Profile and Settings” section on your member dashboard. For e-mail marketing, you can click on the unsubscribe link in the relevant e-mail, and for push notifications sent to you via the App, you can switch these off by changing the settings on your mobile device. From time to time, we may ask you to refresh your marketing preferences by asking you to confirm that you consent to continue receiving marketing information from us.

### 11\. Your rights

Under data protection law, you have rights in respect of the personal information relating to you. In relation to certain rights, we may ask you for information to confirm your identity and, where applicable, to help us to search for your personal information. Except in rare cases, we will respond to you within one month from either (i) the date that we have confirmed your identity or (ii) where we do not need to do this because we already have this information, from the date we received your request. You have the following rights:

  * to **be informed** about the processing of your information (this is what this statement sets out to do);
  * to have your information **corrected if it’s inaccurate** and to have **incomplete information completed** – you can update your details at any time by logging into your account;
  * to **object to processing** of your information where we rely on legitimate interests to process it (see 'Use of your information' above) or where we are using it for direct marketing purposes;
  * to **restrict processing** of your information in certain circumstances including where you contest the accuracy of it, you have objected to it and we are assessing whether we can continue processing it for our legitimate interest or we no longer need your information but you ask us to keep it to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim;
  * to have your information **erased** in certain circumstances including where it is no longer necessary for our purposes, you withdraw your consent or you object to the processing and we have no overriding legitimate interest to continue using it;
  * to **withdraw your consent** to our processing of your personal data where we’ve relied on your consent;
  * to **request access** to your information and information about how we process it;
  * to **move, copy or transfer** your information ( _"data portability"_ ) in certain circumstances and where feasible; and
  * rights relating to **automated decision making** , including profiling.



The way we process your information and the legal basis on which we rely on to process your information may affect the extent to which these rights apply. If you would like to discuss or exercise any of these rights, please contact our DPO on the details provided at the beginning of this policy.

You have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office where your information has or is being used in a way that you believe does not comply with data protection laws. We encourage you to contact us before making any complaint and we will seek to resolve any issues or concerns you may have. You can also contact our DPO with any data protection concerns.
