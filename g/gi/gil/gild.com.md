**THE INFORMATION GILD COLLECTS:**

_back to top ^_

  * Information You Provide:  You may provide to Gild what is generally called “personally identifiable” information (such as your name, education history, email address, credit card number, postal mailing address, and telephone numbers) if you use certain services or products from the Gild Service, enter contests or sweepstakes, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the Gild Service.
  * Assessments. You may take certain assessments (“Assessments”) on the Gild Service in order to complete your profile and apply for certain positions. By taking such Assessments, which Gild reserves the right to review and score in its sole discretion, you acknowledge that Gild may store, use and disclose such Assessments and your performance in such Assessments at Gild’s sole discretion on the Gild Service in connection with your profile and the Gild Service.
  * “Automatically Collected” Information:  When you access the Gild Service (including through your computer or your mobile device) or open one of our emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology.  This “automatically collected” information may include Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), a unique user ID, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the Gild Service, and the dates and times that you visit the Gild Service.
  * “Cookies” Information:  When you access the Gild Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. Gild may use both session cookies and persistent cookies.  A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.  A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Gild Service.  Persistent cookies can be removed.  Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the best way to modify your cookie settings.
  * “Pixel Tags” or “Clear Gifs”: A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our Gild Service but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.
  * Information from Other Sources:  We may also obtain information, including personal information, from third parties and sources other than the Gild Service, as well as from other users of the Gild Service. If we combine or associate information from such other sources with personal information that we collect through the Gild Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.



  
**THE WAY GILD USES INFORMATION:**

_back to top ^_

  * Gild uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide the various features and services found on the Gild Service as well as to track user-generated content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws.
  * We may use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major Gild Service updates, for customer service purposes, and to send privacy or security related notices.
  * Gild uses the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Gild Service works and looks, to create new products, services, features, and functionality.
  * Gild may use “Automatically Collected” information and “Cookies” information to:  (a) automatically update the Gild application on your system; (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the Gild Service; (c) provide customized third-party advertisements, content and information; (d) monitor and report on the effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns; (e) monitor and report aggregate usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and (d) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.



  
**WHEN GILD DISCLOSES INFORMATION:**

_back to top ^_

  * Gild does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent.  Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the Gild Service becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.
  * Additionally, in order to enable potential hiring parties to find and hire you, the Gild Service allows recruiters, employers, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resources professionals to view and search user profiles on the Gild Service. The information shared with such entities may include the information you have provided to us or that we have otherwise collected about you (whether from you or third-party sources), any Assessments you have taken on the Gild Service.
  * Gild may disclose Automatically Collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to assist those parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, or other functionality on the Gild Service.
  * We may disclose some limited User information to affiliated companies, contractors or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist Gild in improving the Gild Service and creating new services features.  We contractually require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.
  * Gild may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. copyright or trademark law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, judicial or other government requirement, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.
  * Gild also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; enforce our Terms of Use; protect Gild from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to initiate, render, bill and collect for amount owed to Gild; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Gild Service; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Gild, our Users, or others.



  
**YOUR CHOICES AND ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION:**

_back to top ^_

You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with Gild, in which case Gild will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Gild Service. Additionally, please be aware that even if you do not provide us with personal information directly, we may nonetheless have prepared a user profile pertaining to you that we have collected from third-party sources.  You may view, update, correct, or delete your user information and preferences, including any user profile that we maintain about you, by contacting us at privacy@gild.com. We may take steps to verify your identity before providing you access to view, update, correct, or delete your personal information. Gild reserves the right to retain and use the information that we collect in a way that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; enforce our Terms of Use; or protect Gild or its users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses.

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information.  You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

  
**ADVERTISERS:**

_back to top ^_

Gild allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Gild Service.  These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements that appear within the Gild Service and they automatically receive your IP Address and other log file information when this happens.  Such third-party ad servers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content.

Gild does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent.  However, please note that if an advertiser asks Gild to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.   These third-party advertisers and web sites may collect information about your online activities over time and across multiple web sites, including the Gild Service, when you use the Gild Service.  To learn more about these practices and to opt-out from the use of this data for serving targeted advertisements, please visit [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).  Gild reserves the right the add or remove third-party ad networks or ad servers in its discretion and Gild may not at all times list such updated ad network or ad server partners in this Privacy Policy.

  
**OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY:**

_back to top ^_

Gild uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards in an effort to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.  We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Gild, and you do so at your own risk.  Once we receive your transmission of information, Gild makes commercially reasonable efforts in an effort to ensure the security of our systems.  However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

If Gild learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Gild may post a notice on the Gild Service if a security breach occurs.  Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.  To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at [privacy@gild.com](mailto:privacy@gild.com).

  
**OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN’S PRIVACY:**

_back to top ^_

You must be over the age of 18 to use and/or access the Gild Service.

If you are under 18 years of age, then please do not use or access the Gild Service at any time or in any manner.

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.  For that reason, Gild does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age.  If Gild learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Gild Service, then Gild will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Gild Service member, then please contact Gild at [privacy@gild.com](mailto:privacy@gild.com) to have that child’s account terminated and information deleted.

**IN THE EVENT OF MERGER OR SALE:**

_back to top ^_

In the event that Gild is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from Users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.

  
**THIRD PARTIES:**

_back to top ^_

Except as otherwise expressly provided otherwise, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you or that you disclose to us. If you disclose your information to others besides Gild, whether they are users of the Gild Service or on other sites or services, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Gild does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
