### The Information PAC Labs Collects:

[back to top ^](http://www.gild.com/blog/about/privacy/#top)

  * Information You Provide:  You may provide to PAC Labs what is generally called “personally identifiable” information (such as your name, education history, email address, credit card number, postal mailing address, and telephone numbers) if you use certain services or products from the PAC Labs Service, enter contests or sweepstakes, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the PAC Labs Service.
  * Assessments. You may take certain assessments (“Assessments”) on the PAC Labs Service in order to complete your profile and apply for certain positions. By taking such Assessments, which PAC Labs reserves the right to review and score in its sole discretion, you acknowledge that PAC Labs may store, use and disclose such Assessment and your performance in such Assessments at PAC Labs’ sole discretion on the PAC Labs Service in connection with your profile and the PAC Labs Service.
  * “Automatically Collected” Information:  When you access the PAC Labs Service (including through your computer or your mobile device) or open one of our emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology.  This “automatically collected” information may include Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), a unique user ID, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the PAC Labs Service, and the dates and times that you visit the PAC Labs Service.


  * “Cookies” Information:  When you access the PAC Labs Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer.  PAC Labs may use both session cookies and persistent cookies.  A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.  A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the PAC Labs Service.  Persistent cookies can be removed.  Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the best way to modify your cookie settings.
  * “Pixel Tags” or “Clear Gifs” A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our Afinos Service but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.

PAC Labs does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent.  However, please note that if an advertiser asks PAC Labs to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.  PAC Labs reserves the right the add or remove third-party ad networks or ad servers in its discretion and PAC Labs may not at all times list such updated ad network or ad server partners in this Privacy Policy.
