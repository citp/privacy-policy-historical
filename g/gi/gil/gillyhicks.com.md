### What Are Cookies, Pixel Tags and URL Links, and How Are These Used on Our Website or in Our Emails?

GillyHicks.com uses, and its third party service providers may use, a browser feature known as a cookie, which assigns a unique identification to your computer. The cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive. The information collected when visiting our Website may include the following: an IP address; the URL of the page from which you arrived; your browser type; other technical information about your device used to visit our Website; the pages you view; the features you use; whether you create an account or sign into an account and where you go on our Website once signed into your account; whether you complete a transaction; whether you have previously completed a survey; and the time of your visit. This information allows us to determine such things as which parts of our Website are most visited or used, what products are browsed and/or purchased, the effectiveness of the Website, your specific interaction with our Website, and difficulties you may experience in accessing our Website. With this knowledge, we can improve the quality of your experience on our Website by recognizing and delivering more of the most desired features and information, personalize your experience, and resolve access difficulties. In addition, GillyHicks.com uses cookies to help keep track of items you put into your shopping cart, whether you purchase any or all of those items, and to tell us whether you have visited GillyHicks.com in the past. This allows you to maintain shopping carts between visits, and allows us to inquire about your continued interest in items in your shopping cart or that you viewed on the Website. GillyHicks.com also uses cookies to help keep track of checkout information, other than payment method information, while you remain on our site. In addition, the information collected by us or our service provider(s) may be linked to and combined with information that we collect about you from your visits to our Website.

GillyHicks.com uses and its third party service providers may also use Pixel Tags (also known as Web beacons, Web bugs, and Clear GIFs) on the Website and in emails. A Pixel Tag is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a Webpage or email message. Pixel Tags may be used to collect the same information about your visit that is collected through cookies, as noted above. We may also collect information about a search engine used, and a search engine advertisement clicked to navigate to the Website. Pixel Tags in emails also help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails (including your interaction with our Website as a result of receiving the email) and the time our email is viewed. This information helps us to make similar evaluations about our Website and emails as with cookies and to determine the most desired features and information so that we can provide those features and information to you and personalize our interactions with you. This information may also be linked to and combined with information that we collect about you from your visits to our Website.

In addition, our email communications to you may include a "click-through URL" linked to a particular page on the Website. By clicking on one of the URLs, you will automatically enter our Website and we may collect information related to the "click-through". You may avoid having this information collected by not clicking on the URL links in our email communications.

### **How Do Others Use Cookies on Our Website to Serve You Advertising?**

We contract with third party advertising companies which collect non-personally identifying information about you by placing cookies on your browser and/or using Pixel Tags when you visit our site. These advertising companies may use information about your visit to deliver our ads on other websites that are a part of their online advertising networks.  We receive aggregate information from these third parties to gauge our advertising effectiveness. To stop receiving cookie-based ads from a third party advertising company we use, click on the link included in the advertisement and follow the instructions on opting out.  We may use more than one third party company for this cookie-based advertising, which would require you to opt out of each company through the advertisement links.  If you would like more information about how cookie-based advertising works in general and more opt-out information, go to: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ (you will leave this site for a centrally managed online site where you can specify your preference).
