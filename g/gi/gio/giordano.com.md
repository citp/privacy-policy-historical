               How long it will need to retain personal data for these purposes will depend on the
               specific personal data. Giordano will generally retain your personal data for at least
               six years after you last provided services to us. Once Giordano has no legal or
               commercial reasons to retain personal data, it will be securely deleted or destroyed.
              Requirement to provide personal data
               It is optional to provide most of the above personal data. However, in many cases, if
               you do not provide that data, it may affect our ability to assess your suitability to
               provide services to us, or your ability to provide services to us.
6.7     Contacting us with a query
        Giordano will collect certain personal data about you if you contact us with a query, in
        store, by mail, email, fax or through our website.
              Types of personal data we collect
               We may collect your name and contact details, and any other personal data in your
               correspondence to us.
              Purposes of processing
               We may use your personal data to respond to your query.
              Legal basis for processing
               The processing described above is necessary for the purposes of Giordano’s
               legitimate interests serving its customers. See section 7 below for more details about
               Giordano’s legitimate interests.
              Recipients or categories of recipients
               We may disclose your personal data to third parties who provide administrative,
               storage, telecommunications, information technology and other services to us in
               support of our business. However, we will ensure that all such service providers are
               subject to obligations not to use or disclose that data. Otherwise, we will not
               disclose your personal data outside Giordano, unless that is necessary to respond to
               your query.
              Transfers
               We may transfer your personal data overseas. Giordano’s information systems are
               hosted on central servers located in Hong Kong, mainland China and Dubai. Any
               personal data that we store on our systems will be transferred to one of those
               locations. See section 8 below for information about the safeguards Giordano adopts
               when transferring personal data overseas.
              Retention period
               Giordano will only retain personal data for as long as it has a legitimate purpose to
               do so. Giordano will need to retain personal data for commercial and legal purposes.
               How long it will need to retain personal data for these purposes will depend on the
               specific personal data.

               Giordano may retain your personal data for as long as it takes to respond to your
               query. After we have responded to your query, we may retain your personal data for
               follow up or record-keeping purposes.
               Once Giordano has no legal or commercial reasons to retain personal data, it will be
               securely deleted or destroyed.
              Requirement to provide personal data
               You may choose what personal data you provide when you send us a query.
7       Legitimate interests
        As noted in section 6 above, in some situations, Giordano may process your personal data
        on the basis of its “legitimate interests”.
        Giordano Group is a global fashion retailer. As such, Giordano has a legitimate interest in:
              advertising, offering and selling its products in physical and online stores;
              developing and growing its business and understanding the needs of its customers; and
              employing and managing its employees and contractors.
        Giordano will only rely on those legitimate interests to process personal data where:
              the processing is necessary for the purposes of those legitimate interests; and
              those legitimate interests are not overridden by the data subject’s interests or
               fundamental rights and freedoms.
8       Transfers
        As noted in section 6 above, Giordano may transfer your personal data to other countries
        and/or regions.
        The information systems of Giordano are hosted on central servers located in Hong Kong,
        mainland China and Dubai. Any personal data that we store on our systems will be
        transferred to one of those locations.
        For the purposes of the GDPR, the European Commission issues adequacy decisions on the
        data privacy laws of non-EU countries and/or regions. A list of current adequacy decisions
        is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-
        protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en.
        The majority of countries and/or regions to which Giordano may transfer personal data are
        not covered by an European Commission adequacy decision. However, many of them do
        have local data privacy laws which are similar to the GDPR.
        Giordano will require that any overseas third party to which it discloses your personal data
        to: (a) only use that personal data for the purposes for which it was disclosed; (b) use all
        technical and organisational measures which are reasonable in the circumstances to secure
        that personal data; (c) delete that personal data when it is no longer required; and (d)
        treat that personal data in accordance with this Privacy Notice and their local data privacy
        law.
9       Automated decision-making including profiling
        Giordano does not engage in any automated decision-making or profiling.
