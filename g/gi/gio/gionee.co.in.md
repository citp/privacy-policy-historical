Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don’t have to enter those credentials each time you log on to a service.  
Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they are spending on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt the Services and provide you with a better experience. Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access a Service. Cookies help us and third parties provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our Services and other websites and apps.  
When you use a web browser to access the Services, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent.
