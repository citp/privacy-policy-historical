# Privacy Policy

Privacy PolicyThe PFA and its client advertisers/sponsors consider Internet user privacy to be of paramount importance. The information below outlines The PFA's commitment to protecting users' privacy and to ensuring the Internet's integrity. 

In the course of delivering an ad to you, we do not collect any personally-identifiable information about you (e.g. names, addresses, etc.). Therefore, we have none to sell, rent, or give away to third parties. The information we collect includes ads served to and clicked on by users. We also collect data indicating whether or not a user visits specific pages of a client advertiser's Web site (e.g. a registration or checkout page). This information is useful only to the specific advertiser who commissioned us to deliver its ads, and only in the context of creative selection and effectiveness reporting. In the unlikely event that a third party gained access to user numbers and non-personally identifiable information, this data would be meaningless and useless.

The Site uses cookies for collecting user information and the data collected in this way may be processed in the same way as other data submitted to The Professional Footballers Association (and outlined above) and for the same purposes. In addition, The PFA may combine this information with other users' information and review it in an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific type of ad or visit a particular kind of website. The PFA stores a random user number in a "cookie" on each user's computer. The PFA cookie stored on a user's hard drive only contains a random user number (most of the sites you visit use some form of cookie). Cookies are not programs and cannot cause damage to your system.

The PFA uses this number to track advertising effectiveness and the Fans Player Awards voting entries. Cookies help deliver personalized browsing. One example of this is measuring ad frequency; this helps us ensure that a user is not bombarded with the same creative over and over again. Another example where a cookie benefits the user is when a regular participant in the Fans Player Awards does not have to complete the registration form every month.  
In some cases, as per the PFA Fans Player Awards, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific ad (this ad may ask you to fill out a survey or provide for example your post code). If this does occur, The PFA may collect this information on its own behalf or on behalf of an advertiser. In this case the following applies.

1\. The Professional Footballers Association is registered under, and will process your personal data in accordance with, data protection legislation.

2\. You hereby agree that the Registration Information (and all updates of the Registration Information) and any other information sent to The Professional Footballers Association by you or otherwise obtained by The Professional Footballers Association about you ("the Personal Data") may be processed by The Professional Footballers Association for the purposes of:  
\- (a) processing your requests;  
\- (b) providing you with information by email or other means;  
\- (c) providing you with information about products and services of The Professional Footballers Association and other parties;  
\- (d) providing a personalised service;  
\- (e) maintaining accounts and records;  
\- (f) administration of membership records;  
\- (g) statistical analysis and conducting market research surveys;  
\- (h) assessing and evaluating the use that is being made of the Site;  
\- (i) information and databank compilation and administration. 

3\. THE PROCESSING OF THE PERSONAL DATA MAY INVOLVE THE PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLERS ASSOCIATION DISCLOSING YOUR DETAILS TO REGULATORY BODIES AND/OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES.

If you do not wish your Personal Data to be disclosed in this manner, please make this clear by sending an appropriately worded message to privacy@givemefootball.com.   
From time to time we may also use your personal data to notify you of other goods and/or services offered by The Professional Footballers Association and/or third party marketing partners.

You will only receive these emails from us if you have opted in by checking the box on the registration page. Additionally, each e-mail we send you will include a description of the simple opt out process to enable you to stop receiving future e-mail.
