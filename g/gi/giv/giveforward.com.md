We may collect both personally identifiable information about you and non-personally identifiable information about your visit when you access our website.

_Non-personally Identifiable Information_ :

The non-personally identifiable information we collect includes the domain name of the site providing you with Internet access, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, which is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university.  Our service may also collect your browser type and version, the operating system your computer is running, and other site visit data such as the pages you view, the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another Web site or a search engine), information you search for, information or ads you click on, the average time spent on our website, and the web site you visit after this web site.  Much of this information is tracked through log files, which are stored on Company’s servers.  **As explained below, we may link this information with your personal information when we feel that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules and policies or terms of service or to protect our Sites, customers or others.**
