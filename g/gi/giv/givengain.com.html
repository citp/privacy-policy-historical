			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		</div>
				<p>
			We ("<a href="/about/">GivenGain</a>") operate several websites
			including givengain.com and givengain.org. It is GivenGain's
			policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may
			collect while operating our websites.
		</p>
 
				<h3 class="dir">Website Visitors</h3>

		<p>Like most website operators, GivenGain collects
			non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
			and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
			language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
			visitor request. GivenGain's purpose in collecting non-personally
			identifying information is to better understand how GivenGain's
			visitors use its website. From time to time, GivenGain may release
			non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
			publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

		<p>GivenGain also collects potentially personally-identifying
			information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. GivenGain does not
			use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not
			disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances
			that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as
			described below.</p>

				<h3 class="dir">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
		<p>Certain visitors to GivenGain's websites choose to interact
			with GivenGain in ways that require GivenGain to gather
			personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
			information that GivenGain gathers depends on the nature of the
			interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for our
			services to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in
			transactions with GivenGain are asked to provide additional
			information, including as necessary the personal and financial
			information required to process those transactions. In each case,
			GivenGain collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
			appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction
			with GivenGain. GivenGain does not disclose personally-identifying
			information other than as described below. And visitors can always
			refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat
			that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
			activities.</p>
		<p>When you make a donation to a cause on GivenGain, whether
			directly on the cause page or on a fundraising page, GivenGain
			collects a variety of personal information about you in order to
			properly process your donation. This personal information may include
			your name, address, phone, email address, the message you have
			written to the cause or fundraiser, and the donation amount.
			GivenGain shares this information with the cause(s) to whom you have
			designated your donation. This way the cause can enter you into their
			database of supporters. We encourage these causes not to share your
			personal information without your knowledge or permission; however,
			this information is subject to their policies and practices and is
			not controlled by GivenGain. We encourage you to review the privacy
			policy of a particular organization before making a donation.</p>
 
				<h3 class="dir">Aggregated Statistics</h3>
		<p>GivenGain may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors
			to its websites. For instance, GivenGain may monitor the most popular
			service accounts on the GivenGain site. GivenGain may display this
			information publicly or provide it to others. However, GivenGain does
			not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
			described below.</p>

				<h3 class="dir">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying
			Information</h3>

		<p>GivenGain discloses potentially personally-identifying and
			personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
			contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
			information in order to process it on GivenGain's behalf or to
			provide services available at GivenGain's websites, and (ii) that
			have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
			contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of
			your home country; by using GivenGain's websites, you consent to
			the transfer of such information to them. GivenGain will not rent or
			sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
			information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and
			affiliated organizations, as described above, GivenGain discloses
			potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
			information only when required to do so by law, or when GivenGain
			believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to
			protect the property or rights of GivenGain, third parties or the
			public at large. If you are a registered user of an GivenGain website
			and have supplied your email address, GivenGain may occasionally send
			you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback,
			or just keep you up to date with what's going on with GivenGain
			and our services. We primarily use GivenGain.com to communicate this
			type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a
			minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or
			via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish
			it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help
			us support other users. GivenGain takes all measures reasonably
			necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration
			or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
			personally-identifying information.</p>
 
				<h3 class="dir">Cookies</h3>
		<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a
			visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides
			to the website each time the visitor returns. GivenGain uses cookies
			to help GivenGain identify and track visitors, their usage of the
			GivenGain website, and their website access preferences. GivenGain
			visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers
			should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
			GivenGain's websites, with the drawback that certain features of
			GivenGain's websites may not function properly without the aid of
			cookies.</p>

				<h3 class="dir">Ads</h3>
		<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users
			by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the
			ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an
			online advertisement to compile information about you or others who
			use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among
			other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will
			be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of
			cookies by GivenGain and does not cover the use of cookies by any
			advertisers.</p>
 
				<h3 class="dir">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
		<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, GivenGain may
			change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in GivenGain's
			sole discretion. GivenGain encourages visitors to frequently check
			this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a
			GivenGain account, you should also check your account dashboard for
			alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any
			change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such
			change.</p>
