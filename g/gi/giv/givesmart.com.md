This Notice applies to the websites where this Notice is posted as well as to any other versions of the GiveSmart website that GiveSmart operates (collectively, the “ **Websites** ”).

In addition, you may provide us with Personal information by participating in online surveys, subscribing to newsletters and other recurring offerings through the Websites, and in connection with other products, services, features, or requests made available through the Websites.
