            <p><strong>YOUR CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY </strong>
<br><br>
By using our web site, you signify that you agree with the terms of our
current Privacy Policy as posted in this area of the site. If you do
not agree with any term in this Policy, please do not use the site. <br><br>
The web site you have entered is operated by Givex Corporation and or
its affiliates (collectively referred to as "Givex"). Givex is
committed to protecting your personal privacy. This Privacy Policy
outlines the type of information that is collected by Givex on this web
site, and how we use and protect it. This Policy also tells you what to
do if you do not want your Personal Information collected when you
visit our web site, and how you can change or delete information you
have already provided to us. <br><br>
<strong>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION </strong>
<br><br>
As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means
personally-identifiable information including, without limitation, your
name, street address, telephone number, screen name and e-mail address.
<br><br>
Throughout this site, you may be asked for Personal Information so that
you can register for a service, send electronic gift certificates,
request information or mailings, buy a product or service from us, fill
out a survey or for a variety of other reasons. Please be assured that
Givex will not collect any Personal Information from this site unless
and until you provide this information to us voluntarily. <br><br>
This site may also collect Personal Information from you about a third
party (for instance, when you send an electronic gift certificate to a
person, we will need you to provide recipient's name and e-mail or
mailing address). Please note that we use such information only for the
specified purpose (eg., to send the electronic gift certificate) and we
will not contact the third party again by e-mail unless and until the
third party contacts us. <br><br>
If you don't want us to have access to your Personal Information,
please do not provide it while using our site. When you provide us with
Personal Information, you are authorizing us to use that information in
accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, including to your
right to limit our use of the Personal Information (see "Who to
Contact" below). <br><br>
<strong>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION </strong>
<br><br>
When you supply Personal Information on this web site, Givex will use
it for the express purpose for which it was collected (e.g. to enter
you in a contest or to send you information). <br><br>
<strong>OTHER INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT</strong> 
<br><br>
Givex may collect other information about you during your visit to our
site, but this information will not be linked to your Personal
Information (that is, it is collected only in the aggregate in
connection with all the users of our site, and will not be linked to
you personally.) Such information may include: </p><ul><li>information about your computer, such as your IP address (a number
assigned to your computer whenever you use the Internet), the type of
Internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system
you are using, and the domain name of the web site from which you
linked to our site; </li><li>information about the areas you visit on our web site; </li><li>information about the products or services you buy through our web site. </li></ul>
<br>
<strong>COOKIES</strong> 
<br><br>
Cookies are files or pieces of information that may be stored in your
computer's hard drive when you visit a web site. Givex may use cookies
to show how and when a user visits areas within our site so that we can
see which areas are popular and which may need improvement. We also use
cookies to help speed up your future activities at our site because the
computer will remember that you have already provided Personal
Information to us. Givex does not share Personal Information obtained
through cookies with any third parties. <br><br>
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you
can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being
sent. <br><br>
<strong>HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong> 
<br><br>
<strong>WE DO NOT SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES</strong> 
<br><br>
Givex does not share any Personal Information with any third parties, except as provided in this Policy. 
<br><br>
At times we may retain third parties to act as our agent to analyze
data we collect on our web sites, including Personal Information,
solely to help us improve our products and our web sites (e.g. if you
request a sample, a market research company hired by us, may contact
you concerning your experience with the product). In addition, if you
order a product or service from us, we may share Personal Information
with suppliers and other third parties to allow delivery of such
product or service. These suppliers and other third parties are not
authorized by us to use your Personal Information in any other way. <br><br>
Finally, please note that we will release Personal Information if in
our opinion we are required or authorized to do so by or pursuant to
law, or by a search warrant, subpoena, court order or other legal
process. <br><br>
<strong>MAILINGS AND OTHER CONTACT</strong> 
<br><br>
Givex will not use your Personal Information to send you any mailings
or to otherwise contact you unless you have expressly authorized us to
do so. In addition, at any time you may let us know that you wish to
discontinue such mailings or contact (see "Who to Contact" below). <br><br>
<strong>CHILDREN </strong>
<br>
Givex is committed to protecting the on-line privacy of children and
making the Internet safe for our users. To that end, no information
should be submitted to or posted on this site by children under the age
of 13 without their parent or guardian's permission. In addition, if a
user younger than 13 wishes to send us Personal Information, he or she
must first give us his or her parent's or guardian's e-mail address so
that we can obtain their permission. No Personal Information will
knowingly be accepted from a child under 13 before this permission is
obtained. <br><br>
If your child has already provided us with Personal Information, you
may ask to see this information for the purpose of correcting it, or
ask us to delete this information from our records entirely (see "Who
to Contact" below.) <br><br>
<strong>SECURITY OF INFORMATION</strong> 
<br><br>
We use state-of-the-art technology to keep your Personal Information as
secure as possible. Access to your Personal Information is permitted
among our employees only on a need-to-know basis, and any outside
contractors with access to such information must first sign a
confidentiality agreement with us. <br><br>
<strong>CHANGES IN OUR POLICY </strong>
<br><br>
Givex reserves the right to change or remove this Privacy Policy at our
discretion. Whenever we make any alteration to this Privacy Policy, we
will post the changes here. We encourage you to visit this area
frequently to stay informed. <br><br>
