<strong>Security</strong><br>
This web site takes every precaution to protect
our users' information. When users submit sensitive
information via the web site, your information is
protected both online and offline.</p>
<p>
When our registration/order form asks users to enter
sensitive information (such as credit card number),
that information is encrypted and is protected with
the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.
While on a secure page, such as our order form, the
lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape
Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes
locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you
are just 'surfing'.</p>
<p>
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive
information online in our Payment System used by
various organization, we also do everything in our
power to protect user-information off-line. All of
our users' information, not just the sensitive information
mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only
employees who need the information to perform a specific
job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer
service representative) are granted access to personally
identifiable information. Our employees must use
password-protected screen-savers when they leave
their desk. When they return, they must reenter their
password to regain access to your information. Furthermore,
ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security
and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as
any time new policies are added, our employees are
notified and/or reminded about the importance we
place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure
our customers' information is protected. Finally,
the servers that we store personally identifiable
information on are kept in a secure environment,
behind a locked cage.</p>
