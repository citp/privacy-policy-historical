This Privacy Policy is for the Give1Get4 web site and it's affiliated web sites.

For each visitor to our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes the visitor's IP address. 

We collect user-specific information on which pages visitors' access or visit. We also collect information volunteered by the visitor, such as survey information and/or site registrations. 

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web page, to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each individual visitor, and to provide further information regarding Give1Get4 through the form of email communication. 

With respect to email: The only way a visitor will be added to our email distribution list is by voluntarily entering their contact information in one of our site guest or registration forms. 

If a visitor or member does not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, they simply need to click the unsubscribe link found in any email they receive from us. Additionally they can let us know by sending an email to the above address or writing to us at the above address. 

With respect to cookies: We use cookies to record user-specific information on which page users access or visit, and record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site. Customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information the visitor sends. 

If you supply us with your postal address on-line you will only receive the information for which you provided us your address.

With respect to security: We take every precaution to protect our Subscribers and Members information.   


When Subscribers and Members submit sensitive information via this Web Site, their information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order forms ask Subscribers and Members to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number, billing information, etc.), that information is encrypted and is protected using industry standard encryption software (128 bit secure socket layers protocols). 

While we use SSL encryption protocols to protect sensitive information online, we also employ security measures to protect Subscribers and Members information off-line. All of our Subscriber and Member information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.
