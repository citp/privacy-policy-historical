By entering Your User Information, You accept that we may retain Your User Information and that it may be held by Us or any third party company which processes it on Our behalf.

We reserve the right to perform statistical analyses of User's behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in, and use of, the various areas of the Site and, in addition, to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of Users that have been exposed to or who have clicked on their advertising banners. We will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties.

 **Cookies**  
You should be aware that information and data may be automatically collected through the use of Cookies. "Cookies" are small text files that store basic information that a web site can use to recognise repeat site visits and as an example, re-call your name if this has been previously supplied. We may use this to observe behaviour and compile aggregate data in order to improve the Site, target the advertising and assess general effectiveness of such advertising.

Cookies do not attach to Your system and damage Your files.
