# Giganews - Privacy Policy

The rapid growth of the internet has brought with it a whole new set of issues regarding personal privacy. Giganews fully respects your privacy rights, and our policies have reflected our commitment to your privacy since we started offering news service to the public. 

What follows is the Giganews Privacy Policy, which has remained unchanged since the company's inception.

**Customer Information**  
Giganews requires certain information at the time of signup and in the course of providing customer support. This information is necessary for us to provide quality service and support. This information is never released to others, unless we are ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction to do so. Giganews has never sold or rented customer lists or any other customer information, and Giganews will never do so.

**Usage Information**  
Giganews monitors our servers to the extent necessary to ensure that high standards of maintenance are met. Giganews does not monitor or record your activities online. We do not monitor which newsgroups you post to or download from or what you put in news articles that you post.

**Civil Investigations**  
Giganews will not release a customer's personal information or usage information to investigators, attorneys, or agencies unless we are directed to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction in the matter. If there is a hearing in court, the customer will be notified so they will have an opportunity to contest the surrender of personal information.

**Criminal Investigations**  
Giganews cooperates fully with law enforcement agencies, yet there must still be a court order before Giganews surrenders customer information. The Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution requires a court order to conduct a search and seizure. Giganews will, when requested by law enforcement entities, acknowledge the existence of personal customer information, and when requested, provide the technical language to include in the court order, "particularly describing ... the property to be seized." In a criminal investigation Giganews is under a duty not to divulge the fact of the investigation to the customer.

**Giganews Privacy Policy**  
Giganews holds personal information about you in the strictest confidence and does not sell or rent that information. Giganews will not release or divulge any customer information unless ordered to do so by a court of law.
