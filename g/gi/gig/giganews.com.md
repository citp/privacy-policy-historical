# Privacy Policy - Giganews

The rapid growth of the internet has brought with it a whole new set of issues regarding personal privacy. Giganews fully respects your privacy rights, and our policies have reflected our commitment to your privacy since we started offering news service to the public. 

What follows is the Giganews Privacy Policy, which has remained unchanged since the company's inception. 

## Member Information

Giganews requires certain information at the time of signup and in the course of providing member support. This information is necessary for us to provide quality service and support. This information is never released to others, unless we are ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction to do so. Giganews has never sold or rented member lists or any other member information, and Giganews will never do so. 

## Usage Information

Giganews monitors our servers to the extent necessary to ensure that high standards of maintenance are met. Giganews does not monitor or record your activities online. We do not monitor which newsgroups you post to or download from or what you put in news articles that you post. 

## Civil Investigations

Giganews will not release a member's personal information or usage information to investigators, attorneys, or agencies unless we are directed to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction in the matter. If there is a hearing in court, the member will be notified so they will have an opportunity to contest the surrender of personal information. 

## Criminal Investigation

Giganews cooperates fully with law enforcement agencies, yet there must still be a court order before Giganews surrenders member information. The Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution requires a court order to conduct a search and seizure. Giganews will, when requested by law enforcement entities, acknowledge the existence of personal member information, and when requested, provide the technical language to include in the court order, "particularly describing ... the property to be seized." In a criminal investigation Giganews is under a duty not to divulge the fact of the investigation to the member. 

## Cookie Policy

Giganews collects personally identifiable information from end users only through web form submissions, primarily for the purpose of enabling the purchase of services and engaging in support and other conversation. This personally identifiable information is associated with your account and can include information such as your name, email address, phone number, payment information and/or physical address. Giganews also collects anonymous information about how visitors use our web site; for example, Giganews utilizes web analytics software to track, in aggregate, the number of unique views received by the pages of the web site, the domains from which users originate along with many other analytical data points. Through the use of web analytics software, the Giganews website may use "cookies" to assist the tracking of how users engage our website. A cookie is a piece of data that the web server stores on the browser's PC which the web browser will then send back to the web server on any future requests, to facilitate identification of the user should they visit the web site again. While much of the information that we collect from users in this manner is not personally identifiable, it may be associated with personally identifiable information that users voluntarily provide to us through our web site. 

## Giganews Privacy Policy

Giganews holds personal information about you in the strictest confidence and does not sell or rent that information. Giganews will not release or divulge any member information unless ordered to do so by a court of law.
