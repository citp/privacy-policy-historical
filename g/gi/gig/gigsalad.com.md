# Gig Salad | Privacy Policy

**GigSalad.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site: www.gigsalad.com**

### External Links

This site contains links to other sites. GigSalad.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

### Registration Forms

Our site's registration form requires members to give us contact information (such as their name and email address).

Contact information from the registration forms is used to create a unique record to identify the user to the system and for sending information to the member but is not used for any other purpose. We never sell or rent our users' information. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This is used for your profiles and is made available to talent buying members for the purpose of contacting you in the event that they would like to make a gig inquiry.

We do not store your credit card information on the website or keep it on file for any reason. That information is entered into our transaction gateway and is not retained in our system. To renew your membership you must re-enter your credit card information.

### Data Quality/Access

This site gives members the following options for changing and modifying information previously provided: click the "edit account" link after logging in and edit your profile. Act names can only be changed by Gig Salad because memberships are non-transferrable.

### Information Automatically Logged

We use your IP address to gather broad demographic information. IP address are generally dynamically allocated (different every time you log on).

### Privacy for Children and Minors

Protecting the privacy of children is important to us. We will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you are not allowed to become a registered member of Gig Salad unless a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use registers you on your behalf. We have designed this policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). It is important to remember that we cannot always determine that a member is a child under the age of 18. Members under the age of 18 must have written parental consent to release their name or other personal information.
