                            Gigya collects personally identifiable information (“PII”) via the Site and the
                            Service. PII is any information that may be used to contact, identify or locate
                            an individual, and includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, email
                            address and postal addresses. We generally collect PII under the following scenarios:
                        </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you choose to provide us with your PII via the Site; including, when you send
                            us an email asking a question, we use that information to answer your question and
                            will store it for a reasonable time. </li>
                        <li>Gigya periodically publishes an email newsletter. If you provide Gigya with your
                            email address for the purposes of receiving Gigya’s email newsletter, we may also
                            email you with further information and offers from Gigya and/or third parties that
                            we believe you may find useful or interesting. If you decide at any time that you
                            no longer wish to receive such communications, please follow the unsubscribe instructions
                            provided within the email. </li>
                        <li>The Service may enable you to send emails to your friends. If you provide your email
                            address or your friends’ email addresses for these purposes, we will store those
                            email addresses, but will not use them to send promotional emails to you or your
                            friends (unless you or your friends independently sign up to receive promotional
                            emails from us.)</li>
                        <li>When Developers and our Clients register to use the Service via the Site, we collect
                            their name, company, email address, website URL and telephone number. We also ask
                            them to select a password for their account. We use this information to help maintain
                            their account.</li>
                        <li>If you choose to use the Service via one of the many open standards for user authentication
                            and access control (e.g., OpenID, OAuth, etc.) that enable you to link the Service
                            with accounts you have already established with social networking platforms (e.g.,
                            Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and/or email platforms (e.g., Yahoo! Mail), Gigya will
                            collect the PII as well as other information that you have already provided to the
                            social networking or email platform. This PII may include your name, email address,
                            postal address, and demographic information such as age, gender and income. Although
                            we won’t use your PII in this manner without your affirmative (“Opt-in”) consent,
                            we may use the demographic information collected this way to increase the relevance
                            of the content and the advertisements that you see while online. In all instances,
                            we obtain and use this information in accordance with the policies of the social
                            networking or email platform.</li>
                        <li>When Developers or Clients use the Service and collect PII, Gigya will immediately
                            transfer the PII back to the Developer or Client and cache such PII for a reasonable
                            time, in order to improve the performance of the service. Please note that information
                            collected by such Web Applications is subject to that particular Developer or Client’s
                            privacy policy, and that Gigya is merely facilitating the collection and transfer
                            of the PII in accordance with that privacy policy. Gigya takes reasonable steps
                            to ensure that our Developers and Clients update their privacy policies accordingly</li>
                        <li>Public Forums. While Gigya takes precautions to ensure the confidentiality of the

                        Information collected on this Site or via the Service may be transferred to — and
                        maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other
                        governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those
                        in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to
                        provide information to Gigya, please be advised that we transfer PII to the United
                        States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your
                        submission of such information represents your consent to that transfer.

                        <b>Links to Other Site</b><br>
                        The Site and Service contain links to other websites. If you choose to visit an
                        advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click
                        on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website.
                        The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement
                        is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with
                        that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security
                        policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These
                        other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect
                        data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites and services follow
                        different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you
                        submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the
                        other websites you visit.

                        the way that we use the information collected through the Site or the Service, we
