# Privacy Policy - Gigya

_Effective November 16, 2011_ **Gigya Privacy Policy**   


Gigya, Inc. (" ** _Gigya_** ") is a technology company offering a set of web-delivered tools and services for enabling and optimizing the distribution of social web content. The Gigya social platform enables online businesses ("Developers") to (a) easily connect their sites to all the major social platforms and integrate with Open ID and other external authentication providers; (b) offer their site visitors ("End Users") on-site authentication, sharing and social features to enhance their experience; and (c) analyze a site's social activity with helpful use data and metrics. Gigya's technology also enables Developers and their End Users to easily distribute web content applications such as photos, videos and other widgets ("Web Applications") to social networks and a wide variety of other web destinations, and directly to mobile devices. 

We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our privacy practices as they pertain to our website, www.gigya.com (the "Site"). We also intend for this policy to inform you about our privacy practices as they pertain to your use of our Web Applications and services (collectively, the "Service"). This Privacy Policy applies to all aspects of the Service, whether made available or accessed via our Site, via the websites of our partners, via other third parties, or on mobile devices. 

**What Information do you collect?**  


_Personally Identifiable Information_  
Gigya collects personally identifiable information ("PII") via the Site and the Service. PII is any information that may be used to contact, identify or locate an individual, and includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, email address and postal addresses. We generally collect PII under the following scenarios: 

  * When you choose to provide us with your PII via the Site; including, when you send us an email asking a question, we use that information to answer your question and will store it for a reasonable time. 
  * Gigya periodically publishes an email newsletter. If you provide Gigya with your email address for the purposes of receiving Gigya's email newsletter, we may also email you with further information and offers from Gigya and/or third parties that we believe you may find useful or interesting. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided within the email. 
  * The Service may enable you to send emails to your friends. If you provide your email address or your friends' email addresses for these purposes, we will store those email addresses, but will not use them to send promotional emails to you or your friends (unless you or your friends independently sign up to receive promotional emails from us.)
  * When Developers register to use the Service via the Site, we collect their name, company, email address, website URL and telephone number. We also ask them to select a password for their account. We use this information to help maintain their account.
  * If you choose to use the Service via one of the many open standards for user authentication and access control (e.g., OpenID, OAuth, Facebook Connect) that enable you to link the Service with accounts you have already established with social networking platforms (e.g., Facebook, MySpace) and/or email platforms (e.g., Yahoo! Mail), Gigya will collect the PII as well as other information that you have already provided to the social networking or email platform. This PII may include, but not be limited to, your name, email address, postal address, and demographic information such as age, gender and income. In all instances, we obtain, store and use this information in accordance with the policies of the social networking or email platform.
  * When Developers use the Service and collect PII, Gigya, will immediately transfer the PII back to the Developer and cache such PII for a reasonable time, in order to improve the performance of the service. Developers may also elect to have Gigya store the collected PII indefinitely. Please note that information collected by such Web Applications is subject to that particular Developer's privacy policy, and that Gigya is merely facilitating the collection, transfer and storage of the PII in accordance with that privacy policy.
  * Public Forums. While Gigya takes precautions to ensure the confidentiality of the PII you submit to us via the Site and/or Service, please note that any information posted to publicly facing sections of the Site or Service will be publicly available. For example, if you are using the social community networking features of our Service, the information you post there (e.g., your opinion about your favorite sports team) will be viewable by others. Similarly, if you post comments on the Gigya Forums section of the Site located at [ http://forum.gigya.com/forum](http://forum.gigya.com/forum), such information will also be available to the public. Any information you choose to provide in a comment or a submission should reflect how much you want others to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and we encourage everyone to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose via this or any other public forum.
  * Emailing via a Gigya Account. End Users may be afforded the opportunity to deploy emails via the Service. Where End Users have selected the option of adding one or more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding template will be sent from Gigya to those email addresses on their behalf. These email addresses will be stored in the address book the Gigya End User creates and will be used only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee. We caution all End Users to utilize this email functionality in a responsible manner.



_Non-Personally Identifiable Information_

We also collect non-personally identifiable information ("Non-PII") via the Site and Service. Non-PII is information that may not, on its own, be used to identify or locate a personal or entity, and includes your IP address (*), browser type, your computer's operating system, which pages you view, which links you click, the amount of time you spend on certain pages and certain demographic information such as age and gender).

This information is used for Site maintenance, and reporting purposes. Please note that Web Application creators may also collect Non-PII as it pertains to their Web Applications, and that the information collected by the Service and transferred to and/or stored on behalf of Developers is subject to that particular Developer's privacy policy.
  * When you create a Web Application which is using the Service, we may record data related to that activity, including but not limited to the URL of the web page(s) where the Web Application is deployed. We use that information to help maintain and track the effectiveness of the Service.
  * Please note that some Non-PII (which does not include demographic information) is also collected from End Users who visit a web page where the Service is enabled. Please note that our Service may facilitate the sharing of Web Applications across many different websites, and that it may not be obvious that a Web Application is present on any particular website that you are visiting.

We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Service and/or to provide services on our behalf, (including, without limitation, bill and credit card payment processing, maintenance, hosting and database management services, web analytics and administration).

If a parent or guardian believes that his or her child has provided us with PII without their consent, he or she should contact us at [privacy@gigya-inc.com](mailto:privacy@gigya-inc.com). If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with PII, we will take reasonable steps to delete such information from our files.

If you'd like to opt-out from having Gigya collect and use your PII(*) and/or Non-PII, please [ click here](http://www.gigya.com/content/DisableCookies.aspx). When you opt-out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out cookie tells us not to collect your Non-PII. Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice. Please also note that opt-ing out in this manner will not impact the information collection practices of the Developers referenced above. You will need to visit the privacy policies of those third parties in order to exercise your opt-out choice as it pertains to them.   
(*) Users must have the ability to opt-out of the collection and processing of their PII, even if they previously provided opt-in consent to such collection and processing. 

**Information Security**  
The security of your information is important to us, including but not limited to the PII collected via the Site and Service. We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

  


**International Transfer - Storage in the United States**  
Information collected on this Site or via the Service may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to Gigya, please be advised that we transfer PII to the United States and process and store it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your consent to that transfer. 

_U.S. - EU and U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Participation for Gigya Inc._

Gigya Inc. ("Gigya") recognizes that the European Union ("EU") has an "ominbus" data protection regime established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) the "Directive") and that Switzerland has adopted a data protection law (together, "Data Privacy Laws"). Among other things, the Data Privacy Laws generally require "adequate protection" for the transfer of personally identifiable information about individuals located in the EU and Switzerland to Gigya's operations in the United States. In connection with providing services to Gigya's customers, Gigya may access personally identifiable information about Gigya's customers' consumers in the EU and Switzerland ("European Consumers") ("European Consumer Data"). Gigya accordingly adheres to the requirements of the US/EU and US/Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the US Department of Commerce ("Safe Harbor") with respect to certain European Consumer Data received in the United States about European Consumers. Our customers act as the data controller for any European Consumer Data collected in the EU and Switzerland and subsequently transferred to Gigya in the US. Gigya acts as a data processor on behalf of our customers with respect to such European Consumer Data and accordingly only carries out the instructions of such customers with regard to the collection, processing, and protection of European Consumer Data. For more information about Safe Harbor please refer to the US Department of Commerce website at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>. European Consumers may first wish to contact the customer with questions regarding European Consumer Data shared with Gigya, as this may be the most efficient means of addressing such access requests. European Consumers may contact the Gigya Safe Harbor Privacy Contact identified below to review the European Consumer Data that Gigya holds about them. Any European Consumer who cannot resolve his or her issue directly with the customer or Gigya can contact the local data protection authority for further information and assistance.
