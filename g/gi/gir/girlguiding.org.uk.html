your parent or guardian before registering or providing any
personal information to us.</p>
<h3>What we do with this information</h3>
<p>The information about your computer detailed above is written to
a text log file held on our web server. These log files are only
accessible to the Web Manager at Girlguiding UK and the server
administrators at the third-party hosting company that manage the
server.</p>
<p>The personal information you provide when you register with us

securely offline at our Trading Service offices.</p>
<h3>What we store in cookie files</h3>
<p>When you log in to the Girlguiding UK website, we store a small

cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your

preferences. If you chose to be recognised on your next visit to

about you to any outside vendors or advertising agencies.</p>

available, technology that is also used by banks and credit card
companies to secure their online transactions. In addition, our
network is guarded by computers called ‘firewalls’.</p>
