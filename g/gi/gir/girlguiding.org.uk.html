your parent or guardian before registering or providing any
personal information to us.</p>
<h3>What we do with this information</h3>
<p>The information about your computer detailed above is written to
a text log file held on our web server. These log files are only
accessible to the Web Manager at Girlguiding and the server
administrators at the third-party hosting company that manage the
server.</p>

securely offline at our Trading Service offices.</p>
<h3>What we store in cookie files</h3>
<p>When you log in to the Girlguiding website, we store a small

available, technology that is also used by banks and credit card
companies to secure their online transactions. In addition, our
network is guarded by computers called ‘firewalls’.</p>
