We are required to rely on one or more lawful grounds to collect and use the personal information that we have outlined above. We consider the grounds listed below to be relevant:

  1. **Consent**



Where you have provided your consent for our use of your personal information in a certain way, for example where we ask for your consent to send you our daily digest email.

Where the processing of your personal information is necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject.

  1. **Legitimate interests**



We rely on this basis where applicable law allows us to collect and use personal information for our legitimate interests and the use of your personal information is fair, balanced, and does not unduly impact your rights.

4.2    We do not sell or lease your personal information to any third parties.

  6. **International Data Transfers**

In such cases, where your personal information is transferred, stored, and/or otherwise processed outside the UK or EU in a country which does not offer an equivalent standard of protection to the UK or EU, we will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that the recipient implements appropriate safeguards designed to protect your personal information (for instance, entering into the standard contractual clauses or relying on the Privacy Shield).
