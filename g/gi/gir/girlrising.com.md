Ten Times Ten, LLC (“Ten Times Ten/Girl Rising,” “we,” “our,” “us”) respects your privacy. This policy describes how we collect, use, and share information related to you.

It is our policy commitment to be transparent about our practices. This commitment reflects the value we place on earning and keeping the trust of our activists, users, viewers, employees, nonprofit and business partners and others who share their personal information with us.

This Global Internet Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and share information when you access the websites, mobile applications, or other online services that we own or operate and that link to this policy (collectively, the “Services”). As used in this Policy, the term “personal information” means information that may directly identify you personally such as name, address, telephone number, email address, etc. As used in this Policy, the term “aggregate information” means non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about visitors, including but not limited to age, gender, frequency of visits to the Services, parts of the Services most frequently accessed, search terms entered, browser type, IP address, etc. Aggregate information is reviewed and analyzed on a collective basis and will not be linked to the identity of any individual person.

Each time you use the Services, the current version of the Policy will apply. Accordingly, when you use the Services, you should check the Effective Date of this Policy (which appears at the end of the document) and review any changes since the last version.
