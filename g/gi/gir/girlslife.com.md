Our subscription department allows anyone over 13 to request or order the magazine, renew a subscription, give a gift subscription or give us a change of address. In order to process those requests, we need to have the following information: Your name, address, e-mail address. We will also ask for the name and address of the girl you are sending the magazine to. If you are renewing or changing your address, we will also ask for your customer number. This number can be found on your magazine, right above your address.
