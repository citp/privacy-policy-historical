This Privacy Policy was published May 21, 2018. 

At Girl.com.au, we are committed as a data controller to protect and respect your privacy in compliance with EU- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016/679, dated April 27th 2016. This Privacy Policy explains when and why we collect personal information, how we use it, the conditions under which we may disclose it to others and how we keep it secure. This Privacy Policy applies to the use of our products and services and to our sales, marketing and customer contract fulfilment activities. 

**When do we collect personal data about you?**

  * When you visit our website.
  * When you register on our website and use our products and services.
  * When you interact with us in person, through correspondence, at events, by phone, or through our website.
  * We may collect personal data if it is considered to be of legitimate interest, and if this interest is not overridden by your privacy interests. Before data is collected we make sure an assessment is made, ensuring that there is an established mutual interest between you and Girl.com.au.



**Why do we collect and use personal data?**

We collect and use personal data mainly to perform customer service, direct sales, and direct marketing. 

We may use your information for the following purposes: 

  * Send you marketing communications which you have requested. These may include information about our products and services, events, activities, and promotions. This communication is subscription based and requires your consent.
  * Send you news and information about the products and services that you are using.

  * Contact you to conduct surveys about your opinion on our products and services.



**Our legal basis for collecting personal data**

Collecting personal data based on consents  
The collection of personal data based on consent from the data subject will be done by using “Consent Forms” that will store documentation related to the consent given by the individual. Individual consents will always be stored and documented in our systems. 

Collecting personal data based on contracts  
We use personal information for fulfilling our obligations related to contracts and agreements with customers and partners. 

Collecting personal data based on legitimate interest  
We may use personal data if it is considered to be of legitimate interest, and if the privacy interests of the data subjects do not override this interest. Normally, to establish the legal basis for data collection, an assessment has been made during which a mutual interest between Girl.com.au and the individual person has been identified. This legal basis is primarily related to our sales and marketing purposes. We will always inform individuals about their privacy rights and the purpose for collecting personal data.
