We want to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for consumers, and in particular, ensure that children (i.e. anyone who is under the age of 18) are protected from adult materials. The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to 2GTS, what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit www.2GirlsTeachSex.com, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct the information.</p>
              <p> Information about You</p>
              <p> Upon registration for membership, 2GTS will specifically ask for information about you. We will ask for your full name, billing address, telephone number and credit card number in order to ship you your products and provide you with all of 2GTS's services.</p>
