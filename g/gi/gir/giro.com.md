# Giro / Privacy Policy

Below is a simplified description of a new law on website privacy (the Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003) for anyone with a website visited by people living in California, and on which website collects info on those who visit that site.

While most of our websites don't likely collect info directly from consumers (via cookies and such), they do suggest consumers e-mail us, and with those e-mails we do collect information. Therefore. we need to add a "privacy policy" in the main menu of each of our websites.

The new law applies to all "operators" of commercial websites and online services that collect personally identifiable information about California consumers. This includes out-of-state operators as well as those based in California.

The term "operator" means the owner of a website or an online service. It does not include third parties that may operate, host or manage the site or service or who process information on behalf of the owner. The term "personally identifiable information" means individually identifiable information collected online about individual consumers, such as a first and last name, a street address, an e-mail address, a telephone number, a social security number or any other identifier that would permit the operator, or others who obtain access to that information, to contact a specific individual. The term "consumer" means any individual who seeks or acquires goods, services, money or credit for personal, family or household purposes. OPPA does not apply to owners of websites that only collect information about other businesses.

The new law requires an operator to conspicuously post a privacy policy on its website or in the case of an online service, to use reasonable means to make that policy available to consumers. In order to meet the "conspicuously posted" requirement:

  * The privacy policy must appear prominently on the home page of a website;
  * The privacy policy must be directly linked to the home page by means of an icon that contains the word "privacy" and uses a color that contrasts with the background of the web page; or 
  * The privacy policy must be linked to the home page by means of a hypertext link that includes the word "privacy," is written in capital letters equal to or greater in size than the surrounding text, or is otherwise readily distinguishable from the surrounding text on the home page.



_The privacy policy itself must do all of the following:_

  * It must identify the categories of personally identifiable information that the operator collects;
  * It must identify the categories of third parties with whom the operator may share the personally identifiable information that it collects;
  * It must describe the process (if any) by which consumers can review and request changes to any of the collected information;
  * It must describe the process by which the operator will notify consumers of material changes in its privacy policy; and
  * It must identify the effective date of the privacy policy.



OPPA contains a built-in "cure period"-it expressly provides that an operator who has been notified that it is not complying with the requirement to post its privacy policy will not be considered in violation of the law unless it fails to post its privacy policy within 30 days of such notification. Other provisions of the new law indicate that an operator intentionally failing to comply with the law will be considered in violation of OPPA even if the noncompliance is immaterial, while an operator whose noncompliance is not intentional, but negligent, will only be considered in violation of OPPA if the noncompliance is material.

The new law does not itself contain enforcement provisions. It is expected that OPPA will be enforced through California's Unfair Competition Law (the "UCL"), which is located at Business and Professions Code §§17200-17209.

Under the UCL, the Attorney General, district attorneys, and certain city and county attorneys may bring civil actions based on acts of "unfair competition" as defined in Business and Professions Code § 17200. Acts of "unfair competition" include acts, in business, that violate any law, which means that once OPPA takes effect in July 2004, a violation of OPPA will also be a violation of the UCL. The identified law enforcement officials may seek civil penalties and injunctive or other equitable relief.

Of greater concern, under the UCL "any person" may bring an action "in the interests of itself, its members, or the general public." This "private attorney general" provision has been broadly interpreted to allow a person with no personal interest and who has suffered no harm to bring a private action for restitution (to be paid to those who have suffered harm) or injunctive relief. 2 In a private attorney general action brought under this special standing provision, the plaintiff may also recover attorney's fees. Therefore, private plaintiffs will be able to use alleged violations of OPPA as a basis for asserting private UCL claims.

Companies must begin complying with the new law immediately. All website privacy policies should disclose:

  * What information website operators collect from those visiting their sites;
  * How that information is used;
  * With whom it is shared;
  * How consumers can review and correct the collected information;
  * Whether consumers can "opt out" of having that information retained by the operator or shared with others; and
  * How consumers can communicate with the operator.


  1. Other examples include a new law requiring companies to maintain databases that include personal information about California residents to disclose any breach in security of those databases, which became effective on July 1, 2003; and a broad prohibition against sending unsolicited commercial e-mail messages ("spam") to California e-mail addresses, which became effective January 1, 2004.
