**What personal information does Esri collect and receive?**

Personal information is information that can potentially identify you as a specific individual. It includes your name, company name, address, telephone number, email address, location, and billing information.

Esri websites and software installation may require registration with personal information to gain access to special services, authorization codes, license keys, or other features. This information will be used to authenticate users, provide support and deliver specialized services.

### Third-Party Information

If you use our referral service to tell a friend about Esri, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. Esri will automatically send your friend a one-time email with an invitation to visit our website. Esri stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at [privacy@esri.com](mailto:privacy@esri.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

In some instances, we may ask you to provide us with the name and phone number of an individual for the purpose of allowing Esri to contact that person in the event of an urgent matter. Esri stores this information for the sole purpose of contacting such individuals as needed. They may contact us at [privacy@esri.com](mailto:privacy@esri.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

### Technologies

We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.

### Log Files

We and our third-party tracking-utility partner gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes the Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), and clickstream data. We do this to improve our services, marketing, analytics, or site functionality and to authenticate users.

**Why is Esri collecting my personal information?**

The personal information we collect is used by Esri and its service providers to complete transactions; ensure appropriate legal use of licensed Esri software and services; allow access to special services or other features; analyze and resolve website and application problems; conduct market research and implement marketing strategies; process orders and register software, data, or services; provide notification to licensees about updates to Esri's and our affiliates' software, data, and services; send you marketing materials, Esri User Conference information, and newsletters; respond to customer service requests and help provide technical and product support.

We partner with a third party to display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities in order to provide you with advertising that is based on your browsing activities and interests.

These Features may collect your IP address, your browser type, and the specific page you are visiting on our website and set a cookie to enable the Features to function properly. Social media features and widgets are hosted either by a third party or directly on our website. Your interactions with the Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.

**With whom does Esri share my personal information?**

We use third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill customers for services, an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf, or technical service providers for customer support. When you sign up for our services, we will share your personal information only as necessary for the third party to provide that service. In addition, Esri may share your personal information with third parties such as an Esri distributor, affiliate, or service provider within or outside the United States. Esri may also share or publish nonpersonal information, such as statistical data that provides information on how our users are using our software applications and services and how many people are visiting our websites. Our affiliates and vendors are also committed to protecting personal information as described in their privacy statements/policies.

Esri will disclose your personal information when required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to legal requirements, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, or prevent fraud or imminent harm or (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Esri.
