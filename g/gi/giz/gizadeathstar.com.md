This site's design is only visible in a graphical browser that supports [web standards](http://www.webstandards.org/upgrade/ "The Web Standards Project's BROWSER UPGRADE initiative."), but its content is accessible to any browser or Internet device.

**What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?**

We might collect your ip address (for security purposes), browser-type and capabilities (so we can keep the site compatable with your browser), and demographic data (out of curiosity) - the typical information provided to a counter/tracker maintained by most web hosts. 

**What about cookies?**

As far as we're concerned, they're sugar, eggs, flour, and a few other friendly ingredients. We don't toss any other kind at you. 

**Do you use single-pixel gifs?**

No, because they're hard to see and don't serve any other purpose that we'd care about. 

**What information do you collect when I sign up for something?**

Only the information you give us. Duh. 

**What other information do you request?**

At this point, we're yawning and rolling over in bed having slept through the previous question. 

**What information do you collect when I purchase an ad?**

We collect only basic information about the content and linking of the ad, payment information, what you send us in email, and what is reported to us by Paypal. 

**Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties?**

We'd like to say we'll only give it up when they pry it from our cold, dead fingers. But the truth is, we'd probably crack before that. We will withhold all information we can legally withhold from anyone; perhaps more if there's an overriding ethical reason for witholding it. We're not really prepared to deal with tanks and other assault vehicles crashing through our doors in order to get your information. We'd at least call the ACLU and anyone else we could. But in the end, with a gun to our heads, we'd probably fork over the minimum info to make the privacy-invaders go away. All the other namby pamby stuff, you know... "edicts of so-called law", "cooperation with unconstitutional privacy-invading investigations", and so on... free speech **IF**... is bullshit. Besides, with the lousy record-keeping around here (shred, shred), we can't be expected to provide reliable cooperation with anyone. Any information you disclose is liable to be cat box liner. 

**Opt-in Policy**

You can opt to read or not read us. We reserve the right to haunt your dreams, however. 

**What else should I know about my privacy when online?**

As much as you can learn. Seriously, visit [**GRC.com**](http://www.grc.com/) as a starting place. 

Also, Please check with the hosts of offsite pages to determine their privacy policy. 

Any time you voluntarily disclose information online - in e-mail, discussion lists, weblogs, or what have you - it can be collected and used by others. Posting or mailing anything anywhere - even signing up with an ISP - may result in unsolicited messages from nearly anyone who bothers. 

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your information. 

**Your Consent To This Agreement**

By using this site, you consent to the specifications above. If we change our privacy policy, we will post the changes here.
