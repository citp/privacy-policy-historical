# Gizmag Privacy Policy

Below is the current policy regarding the usage of data collected by the Gizmag web site (hereafter referred to as "Gizmag"). We re-evaluate this policy on an ongoing basis and if we need to change our policy in the future, we will post these changes here on this page as soon as they go into effect. 

Gizmag collects no personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. 

Gizmag may place a cookie in the browser files of a user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information although it will enable Gizmag to manage the banner advertisements presented to the user. 

We send to your web browser many of the advertisements you see when you use our network of Web sites. However, we also allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our web pages. Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network Web site, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web page from the site. 

Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. 

As always remember, we only authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access, to any personally identifying information about you. 

We have contracted with ValueClick to monitor certain pages of our website for the purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisement 'click-throughs', and/or other activities on our website. Where authorized by us, ValueClick may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about our website visitors. No personally identifiable information is collected by or transferred to any party other than the Advertiser. For more information about how the information is collected and used by ValueClick, please see [ValueClick's privacy policy](http://www.valueclickmedia.com/member_privacy.shtml). 

Individual information on our customers will NEVER be provided to external parties. The aggregated information we collect is used for the following purposes: 

  * to improve the content and design of the Gizmag web site and magazine,
  * to verify our claims of traffic to the site,
  * and to help advertisers and potential advertisers assess the suitability of the site for their ad campaigns.



All e-mail mailing lists maintained by Gizmag contain the names of people who have specifically and knowingly requested to receive information from us. Currently, e-mail addresses may be used by Gizmag to promote our products and for editorial consultations with users. We allow users to opt out of receiving e-mail from Gizmag.com when e-mail information is collected. 

If you have any questions or comments about our privacy practices, you can contact the editor at [editor@gizmag.com](mailto:editor@gizmag.com). 

At gizmag.com, we recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. Here is information on what types of personal information we receive and collect when you use and visit gizmag.com, and how we safeguard your information. We never sell your personal information to third parties.

## Log Files

As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.

## Cookies and Web Beacons

We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.

We also use third party advertisements on gizmag.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

## DoubleClick DART cookies

We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting [this link](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx).

You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.

Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
