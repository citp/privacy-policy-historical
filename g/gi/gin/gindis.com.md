Welcome to iGindis.com, a personal online service operated by Robenov LTD Game Network Inc. ("iGindis.com") which consists of, among other things, software that you have downloaded or are about to download, any software that you have embedded on a web site or are about to embed ("iGindis.com Games"), any applications created by Robenov LTD and available through social networking sites ("Robenov LTD"), any software running on iGindis.com's servers, ("iGindis.com Software"), content, related documentation, information on the iGindis.com domain, and information made available by users to each other through the iGindis.com Software (collectively, the "Service"). Your privacy is important to us and, as described in this Privacy Policy, we have designed the Service to protect information about you from unauthorized disclosure to others. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and, in certain circumstances, share your personally identifying information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us. 

By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy, as such policy may be amended from time to time. We may update the Privacy Policy and if we do, we will post a notice that changes have been made on the website www.iGindis.com.com. You should visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Policy. 

What We Collect 

iGindis.com gives you a number of options regarding what information you will give us: 

When you register a profile with iGindis.com, your profile including any information (name, address, gender) will be registered with iGindis.com. 

When you identify yourself on a iGindis.com site, you may identify yourself using a iGindis.com account. 

When you identify yourself on a iGindis.com site, you may identify yourself through a social network account in which iGindis.com may receive additional information about your profile. 

In each case, we will collect and record the information you have provided. Other than names and email addresses provided at your discretion, we donot generally collect any "Personally Identifying Information" about our users (such as social security number, telephone number, street address, drivers license number, etc.), exception being for billing and payments where we store your billing information such as name, street address, phone number. We may offer you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such as gender, age, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.), or we may be able to collect that information from social networking systems on which you have used iGindis.com Games or Robenov LTD (in accordance with the terms of use of those systems), which would then also be covered by this Privacy Policy. 

In addition to information about yourself, you may choose to share information about yourself in other content ("Content"), such as in games. Any action you perform with other players are considered public, and at your own discretion. 

When you use an Robenov LTD on your social network page or use an Robenov LTD on someone else's page, we may record information regarding the use of that Robenov LTD, and we may collect other information that is visible on your social network page in accordance with the relevant terms of use associated with that page. 

Note that since most iGindis.com Software is served through Robenov LTDs, it is your responsibility to read and accept their Terms of Use, as well as Privacy Policy prior to continuing. 

When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the Service, we collect and maintain on secure servers the information associated with those messages, including email addresses and content. 

We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, iGindis.com games and other users of iGindis.com, to supplement your profile. 

iGindis.com may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by iGindis.com. 

You should also be aware that most content delivered through iGindis.com games originates with another content provider. Such other content providers may place "cookies" on your browser, or otherwise gather information about you, including by asking you to provide information through the site itself. 

Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain internal reports and make recommendations, we collect aggregate information about the use of the Service, including information about users accessing the iGindis.com site or playing iGindis.com games or using Robenov LTDs on other sites, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time ("Activity Information"). 

By using the Service, you consent to our retaining all the above-described information in anonymous form as long as iGindis.com sees fit.

The Service uses cookies to improve the quality of our service, make recommendations, and make the Service easier to use for our users.

Third-Party Advertising Companies 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our site and on certain iGindis.com games and Robenov LTDs.

Similarly, third-party advertising companies may provide us with pixel tags (also called "clear gifs" or "beacons") to help manage and optimize our online advertising. Beacons enable us to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits the site on which the beacon is located, and to learn which banner ads bring users to a given site. 

iGindis.com does not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to third-party advertising companies. Note, however, that if an advertiser asks iGindis.com to show an advertisement to users with certain characteristics (for example, women ages 18-24) or a segment of that group (for example, women ages 18-24 who have viewed certain categories of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the third-party advertising company may conclude that you have the characteristics of the audience that they are trying to reach.
