## Information Gathering

When you register with us, we collect “Personally Identifiable Information,” such as your name, company name, email address, billing address and if payment is required for your plan, credit card information. We collect the e-mail addresses if you communicate with us via e-mail or volunteer information through means such as surveys.

We also collect aggregate, non-personally identifiable information.

For Business Customers, we operate under the assumption that it is generally the Business Customer’s obligation as data controller to notify individuals about the purposes for which they collect and use information about the data subjects, how data subjects can contact the Business Customer with any inquiries or complaints, the types of third parties to which the Business Customer discloses such information, and the choices and means the Business Customer offers for limiting use and disclosure of the information. As a data processor for a Business Customer, we make available this privacy policy so that each Business Customer can better understand our data practices and whether they are consistent with privacy notices such Business Customer has made available to its data subjects. We only collect the information about a Business Customer’s data subjects that such Business Customer provides to us or directs us to collect (“Customer Information”). We may obtain EU and Swiss Personal from data subjects regarding name, postal address, e-mail address, phone number, as well as information relating to payment-card, personal health, clinical-trial data, demographics, purchase history, market-research, employee and student performance and any information a Business Customer may send or direct us to collect from third parties at such Business Customer’s direction. We do not control what Customer Information we receive and host, nor what steps a Business Customer as data controller has taken to ensure that the data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and current.
