Many of DevFactory FZ's web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell DevFactory FZ your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to DevFactory FZ by, for example, registering at one of DevFactory FZ's sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.
