						<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>   
<p>
gDiapers and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Company") recognize privacy as an important issue and have prepared this Privacy Policy to inform you of our data collection and use practices and confirm our commitment to keep your personal information secure.

</p>
<p>

For information on the data collection and use practices of those third parties, please refer to their respective policies and procedures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Information Collection and Use<br>

<strong>Special Notification with respect to Children's Privacy (Users under the Age of 13)</strong><br>

In accordance with Company policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT:

<ul>
	<li>Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable information online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; or </li> 	
	<li>Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties; It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately delete the information from our servers.</li>

Questions regarding children's privacy should be directed to us at the contact information provided at the end of this privacy policy.
