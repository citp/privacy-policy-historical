The Gama Network, producers of the Game Developers Conference and this site, gdconf.com, believe in protecting your privacy in all aspects of our business. We hope you will take the time to read the following policy, which explains what information we collect from you at the sites we own and operate -- gamasutra.com, gdmag.com, gdconf.com and others -- and how we use that information. By using one of our sites, products or services you agree to be bound by this policy. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.

**Information We Collect**

When you visit one of our web sites, we collect your computer's IP address. We also collect personal identifying information that you knowingly provide to us. When you become a Gamasutra.com member, subscribe to _Game Developer_ , or register for one of our conferences/events (such as the Game Developers Conference), you will be asked to provide complete and accurate personal identifying information (such as your name, address, phone number, demographic information and E-mail address). You will also be given the option of providing additional information, such as your company name and fax number. You also may be asked to provide personal identifying information to us under other circumstances, such as when you enter a contest or sweepstakes or participate in a survey. None of the personal identifying information we collect from you will be used or disclosed except as described in this policy.

**How Your Information is Used**

When you submit personal identifying information through any of our sites, that information is shared throughout the Gama Network \-- currently Gamasutra.com, _Game Developer_ magazine, the Game Developers Conference, and The Independent Games Festival. We use the information you submit to improve and to market our products and services, but we allow you to unsubscribe from our mailings or to indicate the format (E-mail, fax, or snailmail) in which you prefer to receive such mailings. 

**  
When Your Information May Be Disclosed**

We may disclose certain personal identifying information about you to third parties, or to other CMP divisions or affiliates, under the circumstances described below. 

_Private information_ : We treat your E-mail address, telephone number and fax number as private information that might not ordinarily be known to others, and we do not share this information with third parties unless you have consented to such disclosure or such disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect our members, subscribers, or registrants from misuse or unauthorized use of the Gama Network sites; (4) protect the personal safety or property of our members, subscribers, registrants, or the public; or (5) respond to service or technical issues regarding your account or E-mail messages. 

_Personal information_ : We consider other personal identifying information you provide (such as your name and mailing address), any optional information you provide (such as your job title), and your computer's IP address to be personal information but also a type of information that would generally be available to others. Unless you tell us otherwise, we may provide this information to our business partners and to certain select third parties. As with private information, personal information also may be disclosed if disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect our members, subscribers, or registrants from misuse or unauthorized use of the Gama Network sites; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our members, subscribers, registrants, or the public. (Among other things, this means that if you provide false membership, subscription or registration information, or if you attempt to pose as someone else, both private and personal information about you-including your computer's IP address-may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions.) 

_Aggregate information_ : The Gama Network sometimes provides aggregate usage or tracking information to third parties. This aggregate information does not contain user-specific information that reveals the identity of a member, subscriber or registrant. We may share this information with anyone since it does not personally identify you and is not correlated to your personal identifying information.

_Information you choose to disclose to third parties_ :   
_Web sites_ : From time to time, the Gama Network may allow third parties to advertise on our sites, or may provide links to sites we think may be of interest to you. If you choose to disclose personal identifying information directly to one of our advertisers or to a site to which we have linked, the information you disclose will be subject to that advertiser's or that site's privacy policy, if one exists. We also may allow third parties to sponsor or co-sponsor contests, promotions or surveys on our site. In order to enter a contest, promotion or survey, you may be asked to provide personal identifying information, and by doing so you agree that such information may be disclosed to the sponsor of the contest, promotion or survey. Any information you choose to submit will be subject to the sponsor's privacy policy, if any. Although the Gama Network encourages third parties to adhere to appropriate privacy standards and policies, we are not responsible for the actions or policies of such parties. 

_Conferences_ : When you register for and attend a Gama Network conference or event, you will receive a registration badge. For your convenience, your badge is encoded with your name and the other information you provided during registration, including demographic and personal identifying information. You can use your badge to obtain information from vendors by inserting your badge into the card reader at the vendor's booth. If you choose to do so, you should be aware that you are providing the vendor with all of your registration information, and that the information you disclose will be subject to that vendor's privacy policy, if any. If you do not want to disclose your registration information to a vendor or other third party, you should not use the card reader and instead should provide, orally or in writing, only the information you wish to disclose.

_Information you choose to disclose publicly_ : Finally, if you knowingly provide personal identifying information such as your user name or E-mail address in a chat or bulletin board area, you should be aware that the information provided can be collected and used by others visiting that area.

**Cookies**

When you visit our sites, the Gama Network may place a cookie on your computer's hard drive in order to improve our service to you. By automatically verifying that you are a member or subscriber, the cookie makes it more convenient for you to use our sites. Cookies also help us compile aggregate information about which areas of our sites are visited most frequently, and we use this traffic information to enhance the content of our sites. We do not correlate traffic information with data about individual users.

If you've set your browser to reject cookies, you can still use all of our sites, although you may need to re-enter information that we would normally obtain from the cookie. You can also set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies; if you do, you will receive a warning message each time one of our sites attempts to place a cookie on your hard drive.

Cookies may also be placed by our advertisers or independent third parties who actually operate the servers on which the ads reside. Although the Gama Network encourages third parties to adhere to appropriate privacy standards and policies, we are not responsible for the actions or policies of such parties.

**Children's Privacy Online**

At the Gama Network, we understand that children's privacy is important. We do not monitor the age of our user audience. However, if you are under age 13, you should not submit personal identifying information to any Gama Network site without the consent of your parent or guardian.
