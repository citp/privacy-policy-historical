### Children’s Personal Data

Although Global Healing Center does not specifically market to children under the age of thirteen (13), we care and are concerned with the privacy of child web users. Thus, Global Healing Center intends on fully complying with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and all provisions and regulations prescribed by COPPA, as well as California’s Online Eraser Law, and the Delaware Online Privacy and Protection Act (“DOPPA”).

Global Healing Center does not knowingly contact, solicit, record, or collect personal information from children under the age of 13 in the U.S., under the age of 18 in California and Delaware, and under the age of 16 in the EU and, in the event we discover that we have been defrauded or deceived into collecting such information, we will either immediately use that information to obtain parental consent or completely destroy the information collected.

Parents have the right to review the personal data that we may have collected about their children. Parents can, at any time, refuse to permit us to collect any more personal data about their children, and can request that we delete from our records all of the personal data that we have collected about their children. Parents should keep in mind that a request to delete such information about their children means that their children will not be able to utilize our Website. In order to request access to, change or delete their child’s personal data, parents can send an e-mail to us at [data@globalhealingcenter.com](mailto:data@globalhealingcenter.com). It will be necessary for you to authenticate yourself as the child’s parent in order to receive any information about that child. A valid request to delete personal data will be undertaken within a reasonable period of time.
