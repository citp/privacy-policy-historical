After you have registered your e-mail address on the Site and if you have clicked "Remember Me" or signed in to the Site, Groove Clip LTD collects Site behavior and browser information as you navigate through the Site. This information may be used to create a profile that we keep on individual Users that details their preferences, personal information and behavior.

During registration a User is required to provide basic contact information (such as name and e-mail address) and establish a password. Depending on the feature being used, the User may be required to provide other information associated with the use of that particular feature.
