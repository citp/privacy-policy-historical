Special categories of particularly sensitive personal information require higher levels of protection. These so-called “special categories of data” include details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data.

  * in limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent
  * where it is necessary to carry out our legal obligations or exercise rights in connection with employment
  * where it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, such as for equal opportunities monitoring
  * where it is necessary in relation to legal claims
  * where it is necessary to protect your interests (or someone else’s interests) and you are not capable of giving your consent
  * where you have already made the information public.



For example, we may collect special categories of information:

  * when you apply to work for us (for diversity and equal opportunities records, to support your needs and facilitate access to our premises, and to carry out background checks);
  * when you attend our events, visit our premises, or apply for a scholarship or funding from us (to make any necessary arrangements for your attendance, monitor diversity, and to investigate claims about breaches of our Conference Code of Conduct).



In limited circumstances, we may request your written consent to allow us to use certain particularly sensitive data. If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the information that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider whether you wish to consent.

The Foundation uses this information to acknowledge your donation and send you occasional solicitations and newsletters. Donors can opt out of all contact or specify only print or e-mail contact by emailing info@gnome.org. Donor names are posted on our [Sponsors and Supporters](https://www.gnome.org/friends/previous-donors/) page as a recognition of their support, as well as listed in our annual report. At the time of the donation, the donor can ask to be anonymous, so that their name will not be publicly recognized.

## Receiving E-Mail

The Foundation may send you e-mail to authorize accounts you create on our sites, to inform you of important upcoming Foundation events, to send occasional solicitations in connection with our donor programs as described above or in response to your questions. For your protection, the Foundation may contact you in the event that we find an issue that requires your immediate attention. The Foundation processes your personal data in these cases to fulfill and comply with its contractual obligations to you, to provide the services you have requested, and to ensure the security of your account.

## Cookies and Other Browser Information

The Foundation’s online services automatically capture IP addresses. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our website, and to help ensure the security of your interaction with our services.

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, the Foundation uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. All sections of Foundation websites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require your browser to accept cookies.

Generally, we use cookies to remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to provide a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or “sign in” and is modified when you “sign out” of our services.

If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you can configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies or asks you each time if you accept them or not. However, you must understand that the use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain services, and by choosing to reject cookies will reduce the performance and functionality of the site. Your browser documentation includes instructions explaining how to enable, disable or delete cookies at the browser level (usually located in the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” facility).

## Our Commitment to Data Security

The Foundation trains its administrators on our privacy policy guidelines and makes our privacy policy available to our partners. Our websites use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts your personal data when you send your personal information on our website. In addition, the Foundation and its partners enter into agreements which require that care and precautions be taken to prevent loss, misuse, or disclosure of your personal data.

We will keep your information for as long as is necessary to provide you with the services that you have requested from us or for as long as we reasonably require to retain the information for our lawful business purposes, such as for the purposes of exercising our legal rights or where we are permitted to do. We operate a data retention policy and look to find ways to reduce the amount of information we hold about you and the length of time that we need to keep it. For information on the length of time that any particular piece of information may be kept, please contact info@gnome.org.

## Public Forums Reminder

The Foundation often makes mailing lists, source repositories, Etherpads, wikis, and IRC logs available to the public. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Please think carefully about your desired level of anonymity before you disclose personal information. Although we value individual ideas and encourage free expression, the Foundation reserves the right to take necessary action to preserve the integrity of these areas, such as removing any posting that is vulgar or inappropriate. It is in the Foundation’s legitimate business interests to provide all users with an accurate record of data and content provided in the public forums it maintains and uses; to maintain the integrity of that data and content for historical, scientific, and research purposes; and to provide an environment for the free exchange of ideas relevant and constructive to the development and propagation of free software.

## Our Commitment to Children’s Online Privacy

Out of special concern for children’s privacy, the Foundation does not knowingly accept online personal information from children under the age of 13. The Foundation does not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to become registered members of our sites. The Foundation does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13.

In the event that the Foundation ever decides to expand its intended site audience to include children under the age of 13, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice addressed to children under 13. In addition, the Foundation will provide an appropriate mechanism to obtain parental approval, allow parents to subsequently make changes to or request removal of their children’s personal information, and provide access to any other information as required by law.

Additionally, EU residents under the age of 16 should not submit their personal data for subscribing to our email solicitations and we will delete any such data if we become aware of it.

## About Links to Other Sites

This site contains links to other sites. The Foundation does not control the information collection of sites that can be reached through links from gnome.org, guadec.org, gnome.asia, flatpak.org or its sub-domains. If you have questions about the data collection procedures of linked sites, please contact those sites directly.

## International Transfers

The Foundation is based in the United States of America. We transact business throughout the world and have operations, processes and systems that cross borders.

If you reside in the European Union, please be advised that your personal data will be processed outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). We will take all steps necessary to ensure that your information is adequately protected and processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including but not limited to:

  * only transferring your personal data to [countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en);
  * where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en) which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US; or
  * where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe (the so-called [European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en)).



We may transfer your personal information to countries in the following regions outside of the EEA: North America and Asia. Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

## Your Rights

Where the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”) applies to the processing of your personal data, especially when you access the website from a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have the following rights, subject to some limitations, against the Foundation:

  * The right to access your personal data;
  * The right to rectify the personal data we hold about you;

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may do so by emailing info@gnome.org Please understand, however, the rights enumerated above are not absolute in all cases.

Where the GDPR applies, you also have the right to withdraw any consent you have given to uses of your personal data. If you wish to withdraw consent that you have previously provided to the Foundation, you may do so emailing info@gnome.org. However, the withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

The Foundation will undertake best efforts to provide these rights to people outside of the EEA as well.

## How to Access, Modify or Update Your Information

The Foundation gives you the ability to access, modify or update your personal data at any time. On sites where you can create accounts, you may log in and make changes to your login information (change your password), your contact information, your general preferences and your personalization settings.
