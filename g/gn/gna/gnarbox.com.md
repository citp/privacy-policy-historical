The technologies we use for automatic data collection may include the following:

**SHARING YOUR INFORMATION**

We will share your Information as follows:

**At Your Instruction**  
If you request us to make your Data available to a third party, and such request furthers the purposes of our Publications or the sale of our Products, we will do so.

 **Sharing with Vendors and Service Providers**  
In certain cases, we use the services of third-party vendors and service providers to assist us in providing the Publications and Products.  We may share your Data with such vendors and service providers solely for that purpose, and we will require those parties to abide by our privacy policies.

 **Third-Party Offers  
** We may allow other companies to offer you their products and publications, including offers through our Publications, co-branded pages hosted by the third parties, or via email. Whether or not you decide to participate in any such offers is up to you. If you purchase a product or service on a co-branded page, or via a third-party offer on our Publications that requires you to submit financial and personal information, you are also consenting to our delivery of this information to that party. The offer will notify you if any financial or personally identifiable information will be shared. Such third party will be authorized to use this information in keeping with our contractual relationship with them and in accordance with their own privacy policy and information practices.

 **Third Party Advertising**.   
We may use aggregated, statistical information to describe our membership and to establish advertising and other business relationships with third parties. We may serve you with targeted advertisements based on your personal or profile information, but we do not provide any of this personal or profile information to an advertiser or any third party with the exception of those uses expressly disclosed in this policy. However, if you click or view an ad on our Publications then you consent to the likelihood that the advertiser will assume that you meet the targeting criteria, if any, used to display such ad, and as described above, you will be subject to the advertiser's privacy policy and information collection practices (if any).

 **Third-Party Ad Servers**.   
We may allow third party ad servers or ad networks to display advertisements on the Publications. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as JavaScript and web beacons. Doing this allows them to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.

In these cases, we may provide certain personal information, such as your name and e-mail address and other financial information necessary for the service to be provided. However, these third parties are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information and are prohibited from retaining, sharing, storing or using this information for any other purposes.

The GDPR also requires that we have a lawful basis for our processing of any personal data about an individual residing in Europe.  For an individual browsing our website or otherwise accessing our Publications, our lawful basis is our legitimate interest in providing the Publications to you in the manner that you desire, and all the Data that we collect from such individuals will be used only for those purposes, as described in this Privacy Policy.  For an individual purchasing Products from us, our lawful basis is the contract under which you purchase Products, and the Data we collect from such individuals will be used only in connection with our contractual relationship with you and only in a manner that furthers the purposes of that contractual relationship, as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

1\. Never access, process, transfer, view, use, or store any Data of any third party without express authorization, and then only for purposes directly related to fulfilling your contractual obligations under your agreement with any third party (“ **Data Secrecy** ”)

2\. Keep all Data strictly confidential and disclose Data only on a strict need-to-know basis to other employees or authorized users only as required for fulfilling an individual’s contractual obligations (“ **Confidentiality** ”); however, you agree that you shall not disclose or otherwise make accessible Data under any circumstances to anyone who has not been obliged to Data Secrecy and Confidentiality.

3\. Ensure that your obligations of Data Secrecy and Confidentiality are observed forever, both during and after the expiration and/or termination of any agreement with us or any contractual relationship you may have with an employer or other party.

4\. Upon our request to provide Company with satisfactory evidence that you have complied with your obligations of Data Secrecy and Confidentiality as set forth in this agreement.

The GDPR also requires us to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the security of Data belonging to residents of Europe.  We make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the privacy and security of the Data of our European visitors and customers, and we are happy to give you a complete description of our most current efforts, if you will write us at support@gnarbox.com.
