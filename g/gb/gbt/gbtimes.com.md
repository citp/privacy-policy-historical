# Privacy statement | gbtimes.com

Thank you for visiting gbtimes.com, a FutuVision Media site. This notice explains our privacy policy and online information practices regarding information we collect about you.

The information we collect

On our websites, you can order products via our online stores, enter contests, vote in polls, express an opinion, subscribe to our services, or participate in one of our online forums or communities.

To help us serve you better, you might need to provide personally identifiable information from time to time while you are on our site. This information may include your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. The information you provide is used to fulfill your request for a particular service.

At certain parts of some of our sites, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to order products, services or participate in the site's activities and offerings.

We may also collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit any of our webpages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Mac OS or Windows Vista) and the domain name of your internet service provider (e.g., AOL UK, Easynet).

How we use the information

We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.

We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter or to inform you about upcoming events, promotions and contests we feel might interest you.

The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities.

If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a comment on one of our articles), we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us.  
We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.

We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company.

Agents and contractors of FutuVision Media and gbtimes.com who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for FutuVision Media and gbtimes.com.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice.

FutuVision Media and gbtimes.com and other sites covered by this Privacy Notice will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.

Cookies & web beacons

To enhance your experience with our sites, many of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.

We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.

"Web beacons" or clear .gifs are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We may use web beacons on this site from time to time for this and other purposes.

Collection of information by Third-Party sites, ad servers, and sponsors

Some of our sites contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

FutuVision Media and gbtimes.com and other sites covered by this Privacy Policy sometimes may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that is sponsored by or cobranded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. FutuVision Media and gbtimes.com have no control over these third parties' use of this information. The FutuVision Media site will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.

Some of the FutuVision Media sites covered by this Privacy Notice may use a reputable third party to present or serve the advertisements that you may see at its Web pages. These third party ad servers may use cookies, web beacons, clear .gifs or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness. The use of these technologies by these third party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our privacy policy.
