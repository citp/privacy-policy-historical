# Privacy and Cookies Policy GPS Review

As most websites do, we collect data in a “log file” for record keeping. We collect things like your IP address, the browser you are using, which pages you visited, and which page you came from. We also use cookies to store information such as your personal preferences. For example if you submit a comment we will try to remember your name so you don’t have to fill it out again, or if you login to some of our features such as the forums, we’ll remember your login information through a cookie. Most browsers allow you to turn off cookies if you don’t want them used, however some of our website features require them.

If you submit information to us and we display that information publicly (like a blog comment or discussion forum post) we use third party tools such as [Akismet](http://akismet.com/) to help control spam. We send your personal information (such as IP address, username, email address, and content you are posting) through automated systems to check it for spam. We may use your IP address to make a best guess as to where you are from and we may display that information with your profile or near your contributed content. For example we may make a guess as to the country you are posting from and post that near your username.

Should we feel you are violating our posting rules or trying to spam our users through comments or discussions then we may share your information (for example the email you used to register and your IP address) with third parties.

We also use third party advertising companies to serve ads. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you. They may not use your name, address, email address, nor telephone number from these visits.

As an example, we use advertisements from Google on this website. They may store a cookie on your computer which enables them to serve relevant advertisements to you based on your visits here and on other websites. You may opt out of Google’s DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). You may opt out of Shopzilla targeted advertising by visiting [Shopzilla Opt Out](http://www.shopzilla.com/ad_retarget_global_opt_out).

This site uses cookies – small text files that are placed on your machine to help the site provide a better user experience. In general, cookies are used to retain user preferences, store information for things like shopping carts, and provide anonymised tracking data to third party applications like Google Analytics. As a rule, cookies will make your browsing experience better. However, you may prefer to disable cookies on this site and on others. The most effective way to do this is to disable cookies in your browser. We suggest consulting the Help section of your browser or taking a look at [the About Cookies website](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) which offers guidance for all modern browsers.
