    * We transfer information about you if the GPWA is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, the GPWA will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
    * The GPWA displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria \- for example, women ages 25-30 from a particular geographic area.
    * The GPWA does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad.
