# GPLDL - Privacy Policy

Your privacy is very important to us! This is why we make sure you are always in control of what we do with your personal information.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to help you understand what information we collect from you, how and when it may be collected and what happens to it.

As technology and privacy laws are changing, we will occasionally update this policy. If you continue to use GPLDL after these changes are posted, you agree to the revised policy.

By signing up for any of the products or services offered by GPLDL (“services”) you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and, as applicable, GPLDL’s Terms of Service. This policy is a legally binding agreement between you (and your client, employer or another entity if you are acting on their behalf) as the user of the Services (referred to as “you” or “your”) and GPLDL and its affiliates. If we add any new features or tools to our services, they will also be subject to this policy.

We will keep your personal information accurate, complete and up-to-date with the information that you provide to us. If you request access to your personal information, we will inform you of the existence, use and disclosure of your personal information as allowed by law, and provide you access to that information.
