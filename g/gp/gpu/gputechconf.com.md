As discussed above, NVIDIA and our third-party partners collect certain information about you when you use our Services through technology such as cookies, web beacons and similar tracking tools for internal and analytic purposes. You may be able to "opt out" of the collection of information through cookies or other tracking technology by actively managing the settings on your browser or mobile device.

We also permit third party online advertising networks and social media companies to collect information about your use of our website over time so that they may play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests on our site as well as on other websites or apps. Typically, this information is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including for example, hashed data, click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, and other information. This information is used to display targeted ads on or through our Services, or to our users or visitors to our websites on other websites or apps, including on Facebook. We may combine personal information that we collect about you with the browsing and tracking information collected by these technologies. We or the online advertising networks use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests.
