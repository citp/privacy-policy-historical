Our Company uses industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving data exchanged between our Company and other companies to help ensure its security. This site has security measures in place to help protect information under our control from the risk of accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration or unauthorized disclosure or access. However, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet.  Also, if this website contains links to other sites, our Company is not responsible for the security practices or the content of such sites.

  5. **Our Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, Web Analytics Services, and Links**

    * **Cookies**. Many of our web pages use “cookies.” Cookies are text files we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences.

    * **Web Beacons.**  Our Company and third parties may also use small pieces of code called “web beacons” or “clear gifs” to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. These “web beacons” may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our Company’s cookie requirements.
    * **Web Analytics Services.**  We use Google Analytics, a service for the marketing analysis of the site provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to allow us to see how you use our site so we can improve your experience.

However, many other sites that are not associated with or authorized by our Company may have links leading to our site. Our Company cannot control these links and we are not responsible for any content appearing on these sites.

## **Privacy Shield Statement**

GFI USA, Inc., Kerio Technologies Inc., and Exinda Inc. (collectively the “GFI Corporate Group”) comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

The GFI Corporate Group has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.  If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov/](https://www.privacyshield.gov/). This Privacy Statement outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the Principles, including the types of information we gather, how we use it and the notice and choice affected individuals have regarding our use of and their ability to correct that information.

**A) Definitions**

“Personal Data” means information that (1)is transferred from the EU/EEA or Switzerland to the United States; (2) is recorded in any form; (3) is about, or pertains to a specific individual; and (4) can be linked to that individual.

“Sensitive Personal Information” means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or that concerns an individual’s health.

**B) Principles**

The GFI Corporate Group may receive Personal Data from its own personnel as well as from its affiliates and other parties located in the EU/EEA. Such information may contain, but is not limited to name (fist and last name), position,  address, email address, phone number, login credentials, human resources data and transaction information and may be about customers, clients of customers, business partners, acquisition targets, potential buyers consultants, employees, and candidates for employment and includes information recorded on various media as well as electronic data.

Other than its own human resources data, the GFI Corporate Group generally does not collect Personal Data directly from individuals. The GFI Corporate Group, however, acting as a data processor may receive Personal Data via its customers. The GFI Corporate Group executes data processing agreements with such customers which set out the parties’ obligations and responsibilities to comply with the Principles. The GFI Corporate Group will cooperate with its customers to enable them to comply with the Principles, to the extent a Principle is applicable to the GFI Corporate Group.

Whenever the GFI Corporate Group collects Personal Data directly from individuals, the GFI Corporate Group complies with the Principles:

  1. **Notice**. We shall inform an individual of the purpose for which we collect and use their Personal Data and the types of third parties to which the GFI Corporate Group discloses or may disclose that Personal Data. The GFI Corporate Group shall provide the individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Data. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Data to the GFI Corporate Group, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before the GFI Corporate Group uses or discloses the Personal Data for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected. The GFI Corporate Group may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

  2. **Choice**. Individuals have the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their Personal Data is (1) to be disclosed to a non-Agent third party or (2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual by contacting our Data Protection Officer via email at [privacy@GFIsoftware.com](mailto:privacy@GFIsoftware.com). For Sensitive Personal Information, The GFI Corporate Group will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively or explicitly (opt in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-Agent third party or for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. The GFI Corporate Group shall treat Sensitive Personal Information received from an individual the same as the individual would treat and identify it as Sensitive Personal Information.  Agents, technology vendors and/or contractors of the GFI Corporate Group or affiliated companies may have access to an individual’s Personal Data on a need to know basis for the purpose of performing services on behalf of the GFI Corporate Group or providing or enabling elements of the services. All such agents, technology vendors and contractors who have access to such information are contractually required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for the GFI Corporate Group or as otherwise required by law.

  3. **Accountability for Onward Transfer.**  Prior to disclosing Personal Data to a third party, we shall notify the individual of such disclosure and allow the individual the choice (opt out) of such disclosure. The GFI Corporate Group shall ensure that any third party to which Personal Data may be disclosed subscribes to the Principles or is subject to laws providing the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles and agrees in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection. The GFI Corporate Group may be held responsible in cases of onward transfers to third parties. 

  4. **Data Security.**  We shall take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. The GFI Corporate Group has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Personal Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. However, the GFI Corporate Group cannot guarantee the security of Personal Data on or transmitted via the Internet.

  5. **Data Integrity**   **and Purpose Limitation.**  We shall only process Personal Data in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, the GFI Corporate Group shall take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.

  6. **Access and Recourse.**  We acknowledge the individual’s right to access their Personal Data. We shall allow an individual access to their Personal Data and allow the individual the opportunity to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. Individuals may contact our Data Protection Officer via email to request access. In cases where the GFI Corporate Group is a Data Processor, individuals must contract the Data Controller. 

  7. **Enforcement and Liability.**  The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over the GFI Corporate Group’s compliance with the Privacy Shield. In compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles, the GFI Corporate Group commits to resolve complaints about privacy and our collection or use of Personal Data. European Union or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact us at: 

GFI Corporate Group  
Data Protection Officer  
401 Congress Avenue, Suite 2650  
Austin Texas 78701 USA  
E-mail: [privacy@gfisoftware.com](mailto:privacy@skyvera.com)

    * **Human Resources Data**. If your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by the GFI Corporate Group, and your inquiry or complaint involves human resource data, you may have your complaint considered by an independent recourse mechanism: for EU/EEA Data Subjects, a panel established by the EU data protection authorities (“DPA Panel”), and for Swiss Data Subjects, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (“FDPIC”). To do so, you should contact the state or national data protection or labor authority in the jurisdiction where you work.  The GFI Corporate Group agrees to cooperate with the relevant national DPAs and to comply with the decisions of the DPA Panel and the FDPIC.  The services of EU DPAs are provided at no cost to you.

    * **Non-Human Resources Data**. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint by the GFI Corporate Group, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit [www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/](http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/) for more information and to file a complaint. GFI CORPORATE GROUP has committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. 

Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through any of the above channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.




**C) Amendments**

This Privacy Statement may be amended from time to time consistent with the requirements of the Shield Frameworks. We will post any revised policy on this website.

**D) Information Subject to Other Policies**

We are committed to following the Principles for all Personal Data within the scope of the Privacy Shield Frameworks. However, certain information is subject to policies of the GFI Corporate Group that may differ in some respects from the general policies set forth in this Privacy Statement.
