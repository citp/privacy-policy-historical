Cookies
In addition to information that you submit, like most websites, GFI uses “cookies” to
remember some details about visitors, such as their language preferences. Cookies are
used for the limited purpose of facilitating your use of this website and to allow you to
access our content with ease. These are not used to store personal information and are
not tied to any personally identifiable information, such as your name or your IP
address. These cookies may, however, allow us to obtain basic information, such as your
general geographic location, the way that you reached our website, and your activity on
our website. GFI’s website may not honor “do not track” signals that it receives from
                                                                                          2


visitors’ web browsers unless honoring such requests is mandated by local law. GFI also
relies on information obtained from cookies to perform ongoing analysis and improve
our website and to tailor our content to your interests.
Pixels
GFI works with third-party partners such as Facebook and Google to tailor our content
to your preferences when you visit our websites through links in advertisements on our
third-party partners’ websites. This information, which may include language and
location information, allows us to work to customize our content and also helps guide
our decisions regarding the effectiveness of certain content so that we can display
content that you are interested in receiving. GFI also relies on information obtained
from pixels to perform ongoing analysis and improve our website and tailor our content
to your interests.
How is this information used?
Information supplied in contact forms is used to send you updates and information
about GFI and our programs, including events, activities, appeals, donation
opportunities, and news.
We also use information to improve our websites and campaigns. By collecting visitor
behavior statistics, we are able to measure interest in our various programs and use this
information to better serve you and make our communications more effective.
How can I stop providing this information?
If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple
procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given
the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie
(or cookies) from a particular site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by
                                                                                          3


changing the settings on your browser or, depending on your jurisdiction, by managing
your tracking preferences as noted in a separately posted cookie statement or via a
posted cookie manager. If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience
some inconvenience in your use of the online services. For example, we may not be able
to recognize your computer, and you may need to log-in every time you visit. You also
may not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant to your interests
and needs. At this time, we do not respond to browser “Do-Not-Track” signals except in
jurisdictions where we are required to do so by law.

GFI uses security protocols to ensure the privacy of your information. We do not sell,
trade, or share email addresses. We use industry standard SSL (secure socket layer)
technology to protect your information and provide a safe and secure environment for
online donations. GFI does not see, store, or retain credit card numbers. Credit card
