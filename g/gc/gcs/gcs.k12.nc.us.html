     Where consent for the use and disclosure of personal information is required, the school will seek consent from the appropriate person.  In the case of a student’s personal information, the school will seek the consent from the student and/ or parent depending on the circumstances and the student’s mental ability and maturity to understand the consequences of the proposed use and disclosure.
