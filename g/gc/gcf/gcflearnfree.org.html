		<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
		<p> Privacy protection is important at GCF Global Learning<sup>®</sup>, and we make
			sure that your personal information remains confidential. Please take a moment
			to read the following statement to learn how we handle your personal information.</p>
		<p>GCF Global Learning<sup>®</sup> is administered by Goodwill Industries of Eastern
			North Carolina, Inc, a 501(c)(3), tax-exempt organization. Our mission is
			to "provide an environment for people to improve the quality of their
			lives through employment and learning opportunities with a focus on persons
			with disabilities."</p>
		<p>Every six months, GCF Global Learning<sup>®</sup> compiles information about its
			training program in order to evaluate the curriculum and make improvements.
			We share this information with those who donate to and support our programs.
			The information that we share, however, is a summation of all learners who participate
			and it does not reveal confidential information about any individual person. </p>
		<h5>Information Release</h5>
		<p>GCF Global Learning<sup>®</sup> recognizes the importance of an individual's privacy
			and does not release individual records to outside agencies for any reason.
			Members have access to their own class records and are responsible for their
			release. Learner records are stored in a secure database for a minimum of
			seven years.</p>
		<h5>Marketing Use</h5>
		
    <p>At times, GCF Global Learning<sup>®</sup> will use member feedback 
      in learner surveys, site feedback email, and bulletin board posts to enhance 
      marketing material. We do not disclose any personal information about the 
      individuals and we refer to them anonymously. (i.e."...," commented 
      a learner who has just completed a beginning computer course.)</p>
		<h5>Bulletin Boards </h5>
		<p>We ask that you exercise common sense and generally be considerate toward
			other users when using our bulletin boards. The purpose of bulletin board
			discussions is to generate conversation about our courses and general information
			about GCF Global Learning<sup>®</sup> . When using this tool, we recommend that you
			do not post personal information about yourself or others. We also ask that
			you do not intentionally post information about a person that is false, harmful,
			obscene, that violates a person's right to privacy, that otherwise violates
			any applicable local, state, national or international law, or that is otherwise
			inappropriate. In the case that information of this nature is posted, GCF
			Global Learning<sup>®</sup>  has the right to remove it from the bulletin boards.
			By participating in bulletin board discussions, you are consenting with these
			terms. </p>
		<h5><a name="Cookies" id="Cookies"></a>Cookies</h5>
		<p>Like many Web sites, GCF Global Learning<sup>®</sup> uses 'cookie' technology,
			in the form of session and stored cookies. A cookie is a piece of data that
			enables a Web site to send information to your browser. By doing this, the
			cookie can collect information to personalize your experience, allow you to
			access your special links and class related material, and allow us to count
			page hits, see what pages are most popular, and help us study traffic patterns
			to better serve you on our site. </p>
		<p>GCF Global Learning<sup>®</sup> does not collect any personal information outside
			of what a member already provides to GCF Global Learning<sup>®</sup>  when signing
			up to become a member and only uses this information to enhance a user's experience
			on our Web site.</p>
