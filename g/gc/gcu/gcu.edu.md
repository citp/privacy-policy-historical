Use of the GCU WiFi Network for On-Campus Students

GCU's internet network is guarded by a firewall that protects students from entering sites the university feels are unsafe or inappropriate. Sites are selected by category to filter usage. Seven categories are set to make the site unavailable but a "continue" button will allow students through to the site, these sites include, but are limited to, drugs, illegal activities, questionable sites, etc. There are eight categories that are set to make sites wholly unavailable (including, but not limited to, pornography, cheating websites, malware, key loggers, etc.) LoudCloud and eBooks websites will be specifically whitelisted to ensure students will always be able to access them. In cases where a student feels a website should be made available, those students will be directed to Residence Life, where the request will be reviewed. Since students do not authenticate on the LOPES network, this web filter's reporting capabilities will be limited to "big-picture" summaries that describe general usage. Reporting on individual students will not be possible. GCU does not proactively monitor usage or sites visited.
