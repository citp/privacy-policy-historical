##  Type of Information Collected and How it is Used 

GCU collects both personally identifiable information (PII) and non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) from its visitors. The information collected is used to help us identify our target market and improve the educational services we offer. The collected information is primarily used for marketing purposes and visitors may expect to receive future communication from GCU.

Non-PII is collected automatically through cookies and other web technology. We also collect certain non-PII when you visit our website, such as the browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer), your operating system (e.g., Windows XP, Mac OS), the domain name from which you receive Internet access, your IP address and aggregate information regarding GCU web pages you access or visit.

This information is collected so that a university representative can contact you. A phone number is also supplied for those who wish to contact GCU by phone.

Our student and faculty sites may also require you to provide specific user identification information, such as username, address, email address and student ID number. This information is collected so our university staff can contact you if necessary. Specific user identification data is also necessary to verify your identity prior to allowing access to some of these sites.

Our Office of Alumni Relations subdomain and other web pages allow visitors to order products or make donations. In these cases, we require contact information and credit card numbers. This information is used for the specific transaction, to purchase and send products ordered and any receipts. GCU also provides the option of ordering by phone.

We may also disclose PII in response to valid legal processes, such as a court order or a subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency's request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company, or if our assets are acquired by another entity.

##  Use of the GCU Wi-Fi Network for On-Campus Students 

GCU's Internet network is guarded by a firewall that protects on-campus students from entering sites that may be unsafe or not in keeping with our Christian values. Sites are selected by category to filter usage. Seven categories are set to make the site unavailable, but pressing the "continue" button allows you through to the site. These site topics include, but are not limited to, drugs, illegal activities, gambling and other questionable sites.

There are eight categories that are identified to make sites wholly unavailable, including, but not limited to pornography, cheating websites, malware, key loggers and sites that promote terrorist activities. The Learning Management System and eBooks websites are specifically white-listed to ensure students are always able to access them.

If you feel a blocked website should be made available, contact the Office of Residence Life, and your request will be reviewed.

The LOPES network, GCU's student intranet, does not authenticate students prior to allowing site access, and their web filter's reporting capabilities are limited to big-picture summaries that describe general usage. Reporting on individual students will not be possible. GCU does not proactively monitor usage or sites visited.
