<p>We are committed to protecting our users privacy!
We offer this statement to inform our users of how we define, gather and utilize personal information. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to alter this policy at any time. Alterations shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, we may occasionally notify you by email about changes to or provide notices of changes by displaying notices or links to notices to you generally on the site. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes and/or modifications will constitute your acceptance of the revised privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.</p>

<p><b>Traffic Data</b></p>
 
<p>Each time a visitor comes to a GCruise web site, our servers -- like most on the web -- collect some basic technical information, including, for example, the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from aolGCruise or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to a GCruise web site) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform).
We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the GCruise sites, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but we will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data without your permission. When we do present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.</p>

A registrant's personal contact and demographic information will not be released to any third-party organization other than named sponsors without the user's consent, and GCruise will request that such named sponsors uphold the privacy of the registrants' information by not distributing or sharing such information with any other businesses or organizations.</p>
 
<p><b>Profiles</b> </p>
 
<p>GCruise encourages users to fill out their profiles as completely as possible, with the understanding that the specific individual shall remain anonymous. Such information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals at any time.</p>
 
<p><b>Our commitment to children's privacy</b> </p>
