# Privacy Policy | GCI

_UPDATED as of June 29, 2017_

## The GCI Commitment

GCI is committed to delivering quality, innovative communications services to our customers. From the time you sign up for GCI services, as you use these services, and as we provide additional services as part of our customer relationship, you entrust with us your information. This information enables us to provide and support services, and the ability to improve, develop, and market services and content to enhance our customers’ experience.

Because your information is important to us, we use reasonable and appropriate technical, security, and procedural measures as a safeguard to mitigate the chances of loss, misuse, and unauthorized disclosure.

In this Privacy Policy, we describe your personally identifiable information, its use and our commitment to protect it, and how federal laws additionally apply to the individual services used by you.

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. We will post any changes to our Website. Your continued use of our Services and/or Websites following the posting of any changes will mean you accept those changes.

## Scope of Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to personally identifiable information generated, delivered, or collected through your use of GCI local and long distance, wireless voice and data, video, and internet services (individually and in any combination), as identified below (the “Services”). This policy also applies to visitors to [www.gci.com](https://web.archive.org/) and [my.gci.com](https://web.archive.org/mygci) (the “Websites”).

Information may be collected when you provide it directly to us, such as by signing up for service or registering a user account (for example, your contact and billing information) and when generated from your use of our services (for example, network or service performance data, device settings, and usage data).

### Personally Identifiable Information (Personal Information)

Your use of GCI services will sometimes generate, deliver, or collect “personally identifiable information” (Personal Information). Personal Information is data associated with you that (1) is not already publicly available and (2) specifically identifies who you are. The type of Personal Information collected, which may vary depending on your subscribed services, may include such items as your ** ** state driver’s license/ID number, social security number, credit/debit card number, bank account number, or similar account information. Aggregate, anonymous, de-identified or other information that does not identify who you are when used by itself is not Personal Information.

More specifically, when linked with the identity of a specific person, Personal Information includes:

  * _Customer Proprietary Network Information_ (“CPNI”) as defined below (such as the quantity, technical configuration, location of certain telecommunication services used, all of which may be linked to your name, address, and phone number);
  * equipment and technical information (such as data about your video equipment, computer hardware and software, modems, routers, device settings, computer and internet connections, including IP addresses, operating systems, browser types and other applications);
  * location information (such as data about your wireless device when it is turned on);
  * service usage data (such as minutes used, bandwidth used, cable box viewing data); and
  * information about activity on GCI websites (such as IP addresses, web addresses of sites visited before and after visiting GCI websites, and other statistical data about visits).



### Use and Protection of Personal Information

We use this information for a number of different purposes, including:

  * To monitor and maintain performance on GCI networks and devices;
  * To develop, support, and deliver purchased products and services, to carry out billing and collection, and to answer your questions related to these services;
  * To deliver more relevant and tailored marketing messages regarding other GCI products or services that may be of interest;
  * To enforce our legal rights, protect GCI, and protect our users against fraud, abuse, and unlawful acts; and
  * For other purposes we disclose to you when you provide your Personal Information, such as when you participate in surveys and promotions.



GCI is committed to protecting the privacy of your Personal Information. We maintain reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative measures in place to mitigate the chance of unauthorized access to or improper use of your information and will continue to enhance security procedures as appropriate.

Because no security tool can provide absolute protection, however, we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will not be subject to inadvertent disclosure through illegal or unauthorized acts by third parties. In the unlikely event of inadvertent disclosure, we will notify you as required by law.

In the course of providing your services, GCI may share Personal Information with our affiliates, contractors, service providers, business partners, and other third parties we use to support our business and provide customers with services. These third parties will be contractually bound to protect your Personal Information and prohibited from using such information for any other purpose. Subject to the above, without your consent, GCI will not sell, trade, or disclose Personal Information that would specifically identify a customer, unless and except to the extent permitted by law.

Under certain circumstances, GCI may be required to disclose Personal Information without your consent:

  * To comply with any court order, law, or other legal process, including requests by the government or regulators;
  * To enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes; and
  * If necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of GCI, our customers, or others.



In the event of a merger, sale, transfer, restructuring, or any other reorganization of some or all of GCI’s assets, your Personal Information may be transferred to a buyer or other successor.

### Information Not Covered by this Policy

Our Privacy Policy does not cover any information you provide or convey directly to companies other than GCI, including services you may access or third parties you may interact with, in the course of using GCI services. Those providers may have separate agreements, terms, and privacy policies that govern the collection, use, and further disclosure of the information you provide to them, which we encourage you to review. To the extent you provide Personal Information directly to them, such information will be subject to their respective privacy policies. For example, you may elect to access your Netflix account through GCI video or internet service. The information you convey to Netflix is not covered by GCI’s Privacy Policy.

You also may access websites or services via your internet or wireless data connections, and in doing so, you may convey or provide information to other providers. GCI’s Privacy Policy does not apply to this information.

GCI’s website may contain links to other websites, including those of third parties that act on our behalf as agents, suppliers, or providers and that may have their own privacy policies. You should be aware that your information may be provided or conveyed by clicking on a link to another company’s website or advertisement from our website.

_We do not control the tracking practices of third parties. We encourage you to consult the privacy policies of third parties whose services you use, as well as websites you visit and with which you do business to learn more about how those parties may use your information._

## Additional Privacy Policy Terms

### GCI TV Subscribers

Under federal law, GCI may use the systems for providing cable service to collect Personal Information ** ** necessary to provide services to its customers and to protect against any unauthorized access to such services. Such information may be disclosed without a customer’s consent when necessary to provide these services or to conduct legitimate related business activities. (Personal Information does not include aggregate data or other data that does not identify a particular person.)

Under certain circumstances, GCI may also be required by law to disclose Personal Information without your consent, such as to a governmental entity in compliance with valid legal process (pursuant to warrants, court orders, or subpoenas), but only after you have had an opportunity to contest the claim. Similar disclosure to a non-governmental entity may also be necessary to comply with a court order, but only after you have been provided notice of such an order.

Federal law also allows the disclosure of names and addresses for other purposes, such as to charities, marketing organizations, and other businesses in the form of mailing lists that do not reveal any information about your viewing habits or transactions made over the cable system. Additionally, GCI may, directly or through its service providers, combine your non-personally identifiable viewing activity with demographic and other information to provide GCI with audience analysis data. We may share this non-personally identifiable information with others for programming, marketing, advertising, and similar purposes. We will not provide third parties with Personal Information, unless we have received your consent, except as required or permitted by law. If you do not wish to have your information shared in this manner, please see “Your Choices” below.

### Local, Long Distance, and Wireless Telecommunications Subscribers

CPNI is a special category of information that includes who, when, and where you call, how much you spend on local, long distance, and wireless telecommunications services, which service plans you use, and information appearing on your bill regarding the type of services and features used, and it is protected by federal law. GCI does not sell or provide CPNI to any third parties. Under certain circumstances, GCI may also be required by to disclose CPNI without your consent, such as to comply with any laws, court orders, or subpoenas.

Within GCI, we use CPNI for billing purposes, to provide and change service, to contact customers for account service issues and to provide information about other GCI products or services that may be of interest. You have a choice about whether or not GCI shares your CPNI within its family of companies to create marketing offers regarding our other services.

For wireless subscribers, GCI and GCI mobile applications primarily use location data (information about the location of your wireless device) to enable and support mobile and data services and to provide 911 emergency services. Other third party mobile applications may also ask for your permission to use your location data for additional purposes. Please consult the respective policies of these third parties to learn more about their privacy practices.

### Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising

Information about browser activity may be used in order to maintain and improve GCI’s network, website, and content performance. In particular, when you browse a GCI website, we may collect information about your device and your visit (such as your IP address, browser type, device settings, and other statistical information). We use such information for operational purposes, as well as to help tailor advertisements to better match your interests and to deliver more relevant marketing messages on our websites, via email, or via other GCI services and devices.

We may also use third parties to implement services to deliver advertisements about GCI products and services on other websites, mobile websites, applications, and widgets. We or our third-party vendors may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to collect information and deliver these ads based on your previous visits to GCI’s websites. These third parties may also collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services.  They may use persistent identifiers to track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond the Websites, and data collected from a particular device that you use may be used with another computer or device that is linked to the browser or device on which that data was collected. While we do not knowingly provide these entities with information that personally identifies you, such third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify you, unknown to us. 

Many of the third-party advertisers that place tracking tools on our Websites are members of programs that offer you additional choices regarding the collection and use of your information. You can learn more about the options available to limit these third parties’ collection and use of your information by visiting the websites for the Network Advertising Initiative and the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://youradchoices.com/aboutus), as well as the webpages for [Facebook’s ad preferences tool](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads/) and [privacy policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php).

We also use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., on our Websites. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Websites, compile reports on the Websites’ activity, and provide other services related to activity on and usage of the Websites. The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, and any referring website. The Websites do not use Google Analytics to gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s [privacy policies](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). To learn more about Google’s partner services and to learn how to opt out of tracking of analytics by Google click [here](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). 

Please note that opting-out of advertising networks services does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using our Websites or on other websites, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs. It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.

### Children Under the Age of 13

GCI is concerned about the safety and privacy of all its users, particularly children. Minors cannot become GCI subscribers, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13 without parental consent. If we learn we have collected Personal Information from a child under 13 without such consent, we will delete such information.
