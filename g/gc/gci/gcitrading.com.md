### Personal Information

When you apply for or maintain a demo or live account with GCI, we collect personal information you provided  for business purposes,  informing you about promotions, products and services that may be of interest to you, and providing customer service.

### About Cookies

Cookies are small files containing information that a Web site uses to track its visitors.

### Security Technology

GCI uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in order to protect certain information that you submit. This type of technology protects you from having your information intercepted by anyone other than GCI while it is being transmitted to us. We work hard to ensure that our Web sites are secure and that they meet industry standards. We also use other safeguards such as firewalls, authentication systems (e.g., passwords and personal identification numbers), and access control mechanisms to control unauthorized access to systems and data.

For example, we may disclose personal information to cooperate with regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies to comply with subpoenas or other official requests, and as necessary to protect our rights or property. Except as described in this privacy policy, we will not use your personal information for any other purpose, unless we describe how such information will be used at the time you disclose it to us or we obtain your permission.
