# Video Games, Game Reviews & News - G4tv.com

**Overview**

This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explains G4 Media, Inc.'s ("G4's") information-gathering and dissemination practices for G4's website, www.g4tv.com (the "Site"). This Site is a companion to **G4** \- **video game television** \- the only 24 hour, seven-day-a-week television network dedicated to video games. G4 airs all-original programming that covers every aspect of the video game culture. Shows geared to adults (18-34) and teens (13-17) feature breaking industry news, reviews, the hottest games, gear and technology, celebrity interviews, insider opinions and the underground trends that feed the video game generation. The network is dedicated to creating a lifestyle brand that is the source of entertainment, news and information about the interactive entertainment industry, including video, computer, online and wireless. This Site provides the G4 community with news, features and interactive forums for maximizing your G4 experience.

G4 takes your privacy rights seriously and has posted this Privacy Policy to let G4 users know what information G4 collects from you, why G4 collects it and what G4 does with it. G4's goal is to collect and use only that information that G4 thinks is necessary for G4's legitimate business interests, such as to better understand and serve you, the G4 community, to provide better service and to improve marketing of the G4 network.

**Acceptance of These Terms**

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the G4 Terms of Use of the Site. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use of the Site, please do not provide G4 with any information and do not use the G4 Site or services. Your continued use of the G4 Site after the Privacy Policy has been modified will signify your acceptance of the changes for information gathered after the date of the change.

**Does this Privacy Policy apply to you?**

This privacy policy covers G4's information collection and use practices for anyone who uses the Site. Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, G4 will not share your personally identifiable information with any third parties unless you give G4 permission to do so or except as required by law or to cooperate with law enforcement authorities.

This Site, however, contains links to other websites, advertisers and other third parties. By clicking on any of these links, you are leaving the Site. G4 has no control over the information collected from or about you by any third party after you have left the Site. _This Privacy Policy does not cover the data collection and use practices of any third party linked to G4._ G4 assumes no liability and is not responsible for any practices of such third party web sites, including their privacy practices or content.

**What information, including personally identifiable information, does G4 collect from and about you?**

Our goal in collecting information from and about you is to provide you with the best web experience possible. In order to provide you with our services, G4 collects two types of information from its community: passive technical information; and information you voluntarily provide to G4, including personally identifiable information.

Passive Technical Information. G4 automatically collects certain technical information for each visitor, including your IP address, the type of browser you use to surf the Internet, your screen resolution, and your computer's operating system. Your IP address tells G4 both your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the general geographic location from which you are connecting. G4 may also use your IP address to track the date and time you accessed the Site, how long you stayed on the Site and what pages you visited. This information is used internally by G4 to help provide a good web experience to our community, including proper formatting for our web pages. This information is also provided in the aggregate to third parties, including potential business partners and advertisers, to describe basic use patterns for the Site, but this information is not linked to any personally identifiable information before it is disclosed unless G4 has obtained your consent. In addition, G4 uses cookies on this Site. Cookies are small data text files that are sent from a server computer to your computer during a browsing session so that the web site may track your activities on the web site. Cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive and are used by web sites to simulate a continuous connection to that site. Cookies, by themselves, do not necessarily let a web site know any personally identifying information about you, such as your real name, address, etc., unless you previously provided that information at the web site or have set your preferences in your browser to provide that information. G4 is not generally interested in any one individual and does not collect personally identifiable information about any one person using cookies. G4 does, however, use cookies to save your password so that you don't have to reenter it each time you visit the Site.

-Information You Provide. G4 does not require anyone to register and become a G4 member for general use of the Site. However, should you choose to register and become a G4 member so that you may take advantage of G4's membership benefits (which include access to G4 chat rooms, message boards and Filter rating systems), G4 requires that you provide the following information: first name, last name, ZIP code, country, e-mail address and date of birth. Additionally, G4 may ask for other optional information so that G4 can learn more about who our users are and what they want out of our Site. In order to better understand our users and to provide you with a better web experience, G4 may analyze the ages of our users in connection with the pages our users tend to visit and the shows they access. G4's use and disclosure of the information you provide us, including personally identifiable information, is set forth below.

**What other organizations besides G4 may be collecting information from you on the Site?**

G4 may use outside advertising companies to display banner advertisements on the Site. Banner advertisements may also contain cookies, and appear to be coming from G4; but, in reality, they are coming from third parties who are serving advertisements on the Site. G4 has no control over the privacy practices of any third party, and the manner in which any third party uses your information is not protected by the terms of this Privacy Policy. Further, once you leave the Site, G4 does not control the privacy policies or the privacy practices of any third parties.

**What happens to my information after G4 collects it?**

When G4 collects information from you, G4 does not share any information with third parties outside of G4 without your consent. You will give this consent by "opting-in" to having your information shared with third parties when you register. These third parties may include G4's marketing partners, who may want specific information to better shape their marketing efforts. Additionally, G4 provides the community the opportunity to be sent newsletters and information about promotional events, publications, and marketing events. Again, G4 will not send this information to you unless you "opt in" for these services and publications.

In addition, G4 will not sell, dispose, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent except as specifically set forth in this paragraph and in the preceding paragraph. When you choose to supply G4 with your personally identifying information, G4 compiles this information in a database with other G4 community members' information and G4 reserves the right to transfer this information to a successor, related entity or to a third party purchasing or succeeding to G4's assets. Further, G4 shares the postal ZIP codes of our users in the aggregate to cable and satellite companies and their affiliates for use in distributing and marketing of the G4 television network.

**How can you review and correct information you submitted to the Site, unsubscribe, or opt out?**

You may review, change, or delete any information you submitted to G4 by going to the "Edit Profile" screen. Additionally, it is optional to supply personally identifying information to use the Site. However, if you do provide G4 with personally identifying information, there are several ways you may unsubscribe from our chat rooms and message boards, and remove your information from our databases. You can send an email to webmaster@g4tv.com. In this email, you must include your user name and password, and a description of the information you would like to change. Alternatively, you can send mail to the following postal address:

G4 Media, Inc.   
5750 Wilshire Blvd.  
Los Angeles, CA 90036

Additionally, if you choose to receive G4 newsletters, you may unsubscribe from this service in the manner indicated in each newsletter.

**What kinds of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under G4's control?**

G4 uses industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under G4's control, including firewalls and other security measures. Nonetheless, due to the inherent dangers of the Internet, G4 cannot guarantee the protection of such information against loss, misuse, or alteration.

Additionally, G4 provides an opportunity for the G4 community to communicate and interact through G4's message boards and chat rooms, and through private messaging in the forums and chat rooms. G4 monitors the message boards with G4 employees and select community members known as moderators to ensure that these communications run smoothly.

**A special notice to parents of children under the age of 13.** The Site is a general audience web site and is intended to be used by adults and teens (13-17) interested in the world of games. It is not intended for children under the age of 13 and G4 will not collect any personal identifiable information for such children. ** **

**Modifications to this privacy policy.**

G4 reserves the right, at G4's discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time to comply with any applicable state or federal regulations, to utilize new technologies or to improve your G4 experience, so please check back periodically to review our Privacy Policy. If G4 changes any portion of this Privacy Policy, the change will be posted in this document so that you will always know what information G4 gathers, how G4 might use that information, and to whom G4 will disclose such information. G4 will not change the use and dissemination practices related to information obtained under a prior version of this Privacy Policy without your prior consent. This Privacy Policy was last changed and posted on our Site on September 8, 2008.
