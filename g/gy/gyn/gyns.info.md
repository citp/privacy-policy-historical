**Privacy Policy**  
This Privacy Policy applies to collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by Domain-Street.com. If there are any exceptions, we will clearly disclose them prior to collecting any information, and will give you an opportunity to choose not to participate or provide the information. By using the Services and our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we outline in this Privacy Policy. Domain-Street.com may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post any changes here so that you are always informed of the information we collect, how we use it, and the circumstances under which we disclose it. Please be aware that, as part of the Services, Domain-Street.com provides links to Web sites operated by third parties, and also provides search results and similar services to third parties for display on their own Web sites or applications. Domain-Street.com is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices or the content of those third party Web sites or applications.

(a) Traffic or Clickstream Data. Data about traffic and usage is not personally identifying or identifiable, and is not supplemented or combined with personally identifying or identifiable information. Domain-Street.com may share information it collects with certain selected third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form. For example, we may tell an advertiser that a certain number of people visited a certain area on our Web site, or searched Web sites for the term "basketball posters." Domain-Street.com collects some information regarding use of the Services by observing browser functions and the files (pages) users’ access. For example, Domain-Street.com's servers collect information about the site from which you entered to enable Domain-Street.com to calculate and pay its affiliates, information about the most frequently searched terms to help its advertisers provide the most relevant search results, information about usage to check for fraudulent behavior or other abnormalities and to ensure that our Services are technically superior. In addition to the foregoing applications, Domain-Street.com uses the information (in aggregate form) to better design the Services.

(b) Cookies. Like many sites, Domain-Street.com collects information about online behavior using cookies.

Our cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. Cookies let us know about repeat visitors and if we are delivering quality products and services. Domain-Street.com.com may also use cookies to identify which sites our repeat visitors are coming from, so that we can place more of our online advertising on these sites, and can, where necessary, pay our affiliates and other business partners. To Domain-Street.com, using information within cookies is an anonymous way to survey how we are doing and to look for ways to improve our Services. You may set your browser software to reject cookies, but you may not be able to use all of the features of the Services.
