Sites, Products and Services are not directed at children under 13 years of age but, we recognize that with proper adult supervision some parents might permit their children to visit and utilize the Nota, Inc.

    <h3>D. Other</h3>
    <h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
    <p>Nota, Inc. may revise, modify or update this Policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat Personal Information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your particular Nota, Inc. account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.&nbsp; You are responsible for periodically checking our Website for changes to this Policy.&nbsp;  If at any time we decide to use Personal Information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will take commercially reasonable measures to obtain consent from you.&nbsp; You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your Personal Information in this different manner.&nbsp; </p>

    <h4>Personal Information Storage and Security</h4>
    <p>We take reasonable precaution to protect the Personal Information we collect from customers, prospective customers, and visitors.&nbsp; When users submit Personal Information via the Website, the information is housed in a secure in-house database in one or more of our offices.&nbsp; The location of our offices may change from time to time and we may acquire offices in other countries at any time.&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that we may transfer your personally identifiable information to or through any country which may not have privacy (data protection) legislation and regulation comparable to the law of the country in which you reside. </p>
    <p>While we strive to protect your Personal Information, you should know that information sent over the Internet, whether by e-mail or by using one of our on-line forms, is not necessarily secure against interception.&nbsp; No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. </p>
    <p>To prevent unauthorized access, loss, or misuse, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Personal Information we maintain.&nbsp; We use industry-standard technology, such as firewalls, in an effort to protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information.&nbsp; Moreover, we encrypt your transmission of sensitive information to us (e.g., account passwords and payment-related identifiable information) via SSL (secured socket layer) protocol in the interest of heightened privacy protection and information integrity.&nbsp; Your account information is also password-protected.&nbsp; However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.</p>
    <p>In addition, only employees who need the information to perform their duties are granted access to personally identifiable information.&nbsp; The unauthorized access or use of such information by an employee is prohibited and constitutes grounds for disciplinary action.&nbsp; Additionally, our information management systems are configured in such a way as to block or inhibit employees from accessing information that they have no authority to access.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Furthermore, our trusted vendors and business partners may be responsible for processing or handling some of the information that we receive.&nbsp; These vendors and business partners are not authorized to use such information for purposes beyond those specified by us and are required to preserve the confidentiality with which we treat such information.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>If Nota, Inc. learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Nota, Inc. Sites, Products and Services or providing Personal Information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of those sites, products and services. We may post a notice on our applicable web sites if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the applicable web sites. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@notaland.com">privacy@notaland.com</a>.</p>

    <h4>Changing your Preferences and Personal Information</h4>
    <p>You can edit your account information with an applicable Nota, Inc. Site, Product and Service at any time. Most Personal Information you may provide is entirely optional. For example, to the extent that parents are considering whether to permit their children to use the Nota, Inc. Sites, Products and Services, we do not condition a child's participation based upon their provision of any more Personal Information than is necessary to operate those sites, products and services.</p>
    <p>You can delete your applicable account by visiting the applicable account deletion page; however, please note that some Personal Information, primarily your contact information, may remain in our records to the extent necessary to protect our legal interests or document compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>
    <p>To have access to your Personal Information, you must provide proof of identification such as full name, street address, city/state and zip code, and/or information about your recent activity on the Website.&nbsp; We reserve the right to deny access to any user if we believe there is a question about your identity.&nbsp; And if the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information.&nbsp; </p>

    <h4>Opt-Out Provision&nbsp; </h4>
    <p>When we first collect information from you, we will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of having your Personal Information shared with parties outside of Nota, Inc. (unless otherwise described in this Policy).&nbsp; In addition, if you do not want us to send you e-mail or postal mail about our products and services, you can opt-out at the time of registration or information collection.&nbsp; If, at a later date, you choose to have your name or any other Personal Information removed from our mailing list, you can do so by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@notaland.com">privacy@notaland.com</a>.&nbsp; </p>

    <h4>Users Outside the United States</h4>
    <p>We are a U.S.-based company and its business operations are primarily conducted in the State of California.&nbsp; We operate our company and administer this Policy under applicable laws and regulations of the State of California, and the United States.&nbsp; If you use our Nota, Inc. Sites, Products and Services from outside the United States, you are thereby consenting for your Personal Information to be processed in the United States in the manner described in this Policy.&nbsp;  Furthermore, you acknowledge that the privacy laws of the State of California and the United States may differ from the laws in the country where you are located and may not provide you the same rights or protections as those laws.</p>

    <h4>No Guarantees</h4>
    <p>While this Policy states our standards for maintenance of Personal Information and we will make reasonable efforts to meet them, we are not in a position to guarantee these standards.&nbsp; There may be factors beyond our control that may result in disclosure of Personal Information.&nbsp; As a consequence, we disclaim any warranties or representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure of any Personal Information collected from any Nota, Inc. Site, Product or Service.</p>
