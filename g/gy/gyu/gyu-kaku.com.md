  1. **PURPOSE OF POLICY.**  This Policy explains how Gyu-Kaku uses your information and applies to all who visit our Gyu-Kaku restaurants or who use our websites, mobile or tablet websites, mobile or tablet applications, electronic services, social networking sites, interactive features, software, technology, tools, content, promotions, sweepstakes, services, products, goods, equipment, and any other materials or any other online activities or platform we own or control (collectively, the “Gyu-Kaku Site”), or when you contact us in any manner. We created this Policy to give you confidence as you visit and use the Gyu-Kaku Site, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Policy is only applicable to the Gyu-Kaku Site and not to any other websites or mobile applications that you may be able to access from the Gyu-Kaku Site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy.

  2. **AGREEMENT TO TERMS OF PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF USE**. All activities in which you may engage on the Gyu-Kaku Site are voluntary. You are not required to provide any personal information to us unless you choose to access features on the Gyu-Kaku Site that require such information. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy or other terms of use on the Gyu-Kaku Site, then you should immediately exit the Gyu-Kaku Site and discontinue using the Gyu-Kaku Site. If you do not agree with the terms of our Policy and our terms of use, please do not provide us with personal information, and exit the Gyu-Kaku Site.

**Information Collected Via Technology – Do We Use “Cookies”?**  As you use the Gyu-Kaku Site, certain information may be passively collected and stored on our service providers’ server logs, including your device information (e.g., Internet protocol address, browser type, device settings, and operating system) and usage information (e.g., the Gyu-Kaku Site you use, the time and duration of your use of the Gyu-Kaku Site, and other information about your interaction with content offered through the Gyu-Kaku Site). We also use cookies and navigational data, like Uniform Resource Locators (“URLs”), to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on the Gyu-Kaku Site you clicked. An Internet protocol address, or “IP Address,” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the Gyu-Kaku Site. They are used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current Gyu-Kaku Site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about Gyu-Kaku Site traffic and Gyu-Kaku Site interaction so that we can offer better Gyu-Kaku Site experiences and tools in the future. You can manage your cookie preferences via your browser settings; however, if you choose to disable this function, your experience at the Gyu-Kaku Site may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended.

**Mobile and Location Information.**  If you use mobile-enabled services provided by the Gyu-Kaku Site, such as any Gyu-Kaku mobile or tablet application made available by us, we may receive information about your use of our services from your mobile device while you use our applications or services. This may also include information about your precise location if you have enabled location-based services on your mobile device. We may also receive information about your device and may access your camera, microphone, or other device services or hardware. Some devices may allow you to opt-out of this collection or access, and in those cases, you may be able to subsequently stop the collection or access. Please review your device settings for more information.

**Information from Third Party Sources.  **We may receive information about you from publicly and commercially available third party sources, as permitted by law, which we may combine with other information we receive from or about you. For example, we may receive information about you from a social media site if you connect to the Gyu-Kaku Site from that social media site.

**Other Information We Collect.**  We also may collect other information about you, your device, or your use of the Gyu-Kaku Site in ways that we describe to you at the point of collection or otherwise with your consent.​

  1. **Third Party Access to Your Information.**  Although you are entering into an agreement to disclose your information to us pursuant to this Policy, we do use third party individuals and organizations to assist us, including contractors, web hosts, app developers, and others. Throughout the course of our provision of the Gyu-Kaku Site to you, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your information. For example, our web host stores the information that you provide us, and we may hire outside contractors to perform maintenance or assist us in securing our website, or, our online and mobile interface provider develops and hosts a mobile application for us. It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Policy. For this reason, you hereby agree that every authorization that you grant to us in this Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving the Gyu-Kaku Site or its underlying files or systems. You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.

  2. **THIRD PARTY USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.**  Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share for marketing purposes the personal information that we collect with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.

However, we may provide your personal information to third party service providers or affiliates to perform business functions on our behalf or in conjunction with us. For example, we may use third parties to help us make our products, goods, and services available to you, fulfill orders you may have placed, process credit card payments, provide customer service, ship postal mail and packages, deliver your mail and packages, conduct market research or information analysis, manage promotions and sweepstakes, and contact you in connection with the Gyu-Kaku Site. We limit information provided to the aforementioned affiliate and third party service providers to the extent necessary for them to provide the services and require such service providers to promise not to use such information except as necessary to provide the relevant services to us. In these instances, we may need to provide your information to these third parties for such purposes.

Additionally, in the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Policy, and that any acquirer of ours or that acquirer’s assets may continue to process your personal information as set forth in this Policy.

We may also disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or if we need to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; (b) share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law; or (c) restrict or inhibit any user from using our Gyu-Kaku Site, including, without limitation, by means of "hacking" or defacing any portion thereof.

You hereby consent to us sharing your personal information under the circumstances described herein. If you do not want us to use or disclose personal information collected about you in the manner identified in this Policy, you may not use the Gyu-Kaku Site.

You may update your subscription preferences at any time.

  4. **SECURITY.  **We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Even though we have taken significant steps to protect your personal information, no company, including us, can fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information. The Gyu-Kaku Site has security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you. Please keep in mind, however, that whenever you give out personal information online there is a risk that third parties may intercept and use that information. While Gyu-Kaku strives to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online. By using the Gyu-Kaku Site, you expressly acknowledge and agree that we do not guarantee the security of any data provided to or received by us through the Gyu-Kaku Site and that any personal information, general information, or other data or information received from you through the Gyu-Kaku Site is provided to us at your own risk, which you expressly assume.

  5. **California's "Do Not Track" Notice; THIRD PARTY BEHAVIORAL TRACKING.**  "Do Not Track" ("DNT") is a preference you can set in your web browser to let the sites you visit know that you do not want them collecting information about you. We honor DNT signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a DNT browser mechanism is in place. For further details regarding DNT, visit donottrack.us. Further, we do not allow third party behavioral tracking.

  6. **THIRD PARTY WEBSITES.** The Gyu-Kaku Site may contain links to other websites or mobile applications. This includes services in connection with third party "social media" and other sites that would allow personal information to be transferred to such third parties (e.g., Open Table, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.). If you choose to visit other websites or mobile applications, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those other websites or mobile applications, and it is your responsibility to review the privacy policies at those websites or mobile applications to confirm that you understand and agree with their policies.

  7. **Your California Privacy Rights.  **California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as S.B. 27 or the “Shine the Light” law, allows individual customers who have provided their personal information to us to request information about our disclosure of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Such requests must be submitted to us by contacting us in accordance with the “Contact Us” section below. Within thirty (30) days of receiving such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third party direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding year, along with the names and addresses of those third parties. This request may be made no more than once per calendar year. We reserve the right not to respond to requests submitted in ways other than those specified above.

By using the Gyu-Kaku Site or giving us your personal information, you are directly transferring your personal information and non-identifiable information to us in the United States. The United States may not have the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction. However, you agree and consent to our receipt, collection, transfer, and processing of your personal information and non-identifiable information in accordance with this Policy. You are solely responsible for compliance with any data protection or privacy obligations in your jurisdiction when you use the Gyu-Kaku Site or provide us with personal information. Regardless of where we transfer your information, we still protect your information in the manner described in this Policy.

  9. **Class Action Waiver.**  ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL ACTION.
