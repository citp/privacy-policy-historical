At GymLive we value the privacy of our users and it’s important for us that you understand what happens to the information you provide to us. This document is to help you understand how we use, store, collect and disclose your data. 

#### Collection of Information

You are free to browse this GymLive without revealing any personal information making it possible to identify you. However, once you have sent us your identifiable personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. We collect two types of information from Users/Organizers of the GymLive: “Automatic Anonymous Information” and “Identifiable Personal Information”.

####  Identifiable Personal Information (IPI) 

IPI is individually identifiable information about you that allows us to identify or contact you. Some of the GymLive’s functions require asking you for certain IPI, such as your instagram username, instagram password and/or other personal information. 

But we do not handle your Instagram passwords directly. We use Instagram's API and OAuth 2.0 protocol to authorize Our users. Our databases are secured with passwords to guard against unauthorized access of Our systems. Only engineer staff members may access data on a need-to-know basis. 

You may choose to provide IPI in order to access certain functions on the GymLive. You can always choose not to provide certain information, but in that case it may be that you cannot use certain of the GymLive’s functions. 

####  Sharing of Information to third parties 

The GymLive will target advertising based on personal information provided by users and inferred from GymLive usage. This may include gender, age, or geographic data. GymLive does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. We may bundle and share the non-personal information we collect from you and other users with advertisers, third parties, trusted partners and affiliates so that they display advertising that better suits your interests. We may aggregate your PII with information about others. In that case we will make your information non-personally identifiable by removing your name and other characteristics that would identify it as you. We may use and/or share the resulting non-PII with third parties. We may provide some non-personal information to others who help us understand how you use the GymLive. 

####  Sharing and Disclosure of Information to any authority parties
