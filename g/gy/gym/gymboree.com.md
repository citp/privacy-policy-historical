The information in the log files may include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider), the web browser you used to visit the Site, the time you visited the Site, which web pages you visited on the Site, and other anonymous Site usage data. 

We use cookies (a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your web browser) and web beacons (an electronic file placed within a website that monitors usage). We use cookies and web beacons to improve the quality of our Sites, to keep track of your electronic shopping bag and to remember you if you sign in to your account.

## The Purposes For Which We Collect And Use Information

Gymboree collects and uses personal information and other information for three general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see on our Sites; to fulfill your requests for certain products and services (e.g. shipping your order to you, processing your credit card); and to contact you about new products or services, special events and promotions. In addition, Gymboree collects your personal information in connection with a non-receipted return for loss prevention purposes.

## When We May Share Information With Others

We will not sell, share or rent personal information to third parties, and we will not otherwise disclose personal information to third parties, without your permission, except as disclosed in this policy. 

From time to time, we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours. For example, we may contract with service providers to provide certain services including credit card processing, data management, promotional services, Web hosting, Web development, etc. We provide our service providers only with the information (which may include your personal information) needed for them to perform these services. Each service provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. 

Where you have given your permission, or where otherwise permitted by applicable laws, in certain instances we may disclose personal information and other information when we believe it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against persons or entities in order to protect Gymboree or our customers or when we believe that the law or legal process requires such disclosure. 

We may also share or cross-reference, or cause to be shared or cross-referenced, such information, including your personal information, with unrelated companies you may be interested in so that the companies can directly market their products or services to you; provided, however, you may always opt out of such marketing efforts (as described above). 

We may also use overseas facilities to process, store or back up electronic information. As a result, you hereby consent to us transferring your personal information to overseas facilities for such purposes. 

We may also share your personal information and other information with entities controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Gymboree. In the event that some or all of our business assets are sold or transferred, we would transfer your information to the buyer or transferee and for due diligence purposes to its professional advisors under an obligation of confidentiality. 

We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our Sites. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to our Sites and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. Our systems do not recognize browser ŸDo Not Track÷ signals, but several of our service providers who utilize these cookies or web beacons on our Sites enable you to opt out of this advertising practice. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/. We also provide you with additional tools to opt out of marketing from us or certain transfers of your information. You can learn about this in the ŸYour Privacy Rights÷ section of this Privacy Policy. 

Please note that, from time to time, personal information collected from you may be processed and stored by us or our service providers in jurisdictions in which disclosure may be compelled by governments, law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies of those jurisdictions as required or permitted by the laws and courts of those jurisdictions. Depending on the laws of the applicable jurisdiction, we may not be allowed to provide notice to you of such required disclosure. 

By providing your personal information to us, either online or in-store, you agree that we may collect, use and disclose your personal information for the purposes outlined above.
