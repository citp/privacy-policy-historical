### PRIVACY POLICY

Last Revised: July 2012

This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personally identifiable information is collected, used and disclosed by Gyft, Inc. ("Gyft", "we", "our" or "us") with respect to your access and use of our mobile application ("App"), the Gyft website located at [http://www.gyft.com](http://www.gyft.com/) (the "Site") and Gyft's products and services (collectively, the "Service"), so that you can make an informed decision about using the Service.

We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy from time-to-time to make sure that you understand how any personally identifiable information you provide to us or collected about you will be used. 

**What Is Personally Identifiable Information?**

As used in this Policy, the term "personally identifiable information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, user name or email address), or information about that individual that is directly linked to information that specifically identifies an individual. Personally identifiable information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Service or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personally identifiable information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.

**What Information Do We Collect?**

Active Collection: We collect information from you in various ways when you use the Service and App. For example, we collect information: (i) that you voluntarily provide to us (such as when you send us an email or create a Gyft account); and (ii) to which you provide us access. Such information may include personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, social network data, other account data, and financial information. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with posting data, providing access to your online groups and other activities in connection with the Service.

Passive Collection: When you use the Service, some information is also automatically collected. For example, we may automatically collect certain information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, unique device identifier (UDID), your mobile number, your device model and name, your operating system, your browser type, your preferred language, and your activity on the Service. We may also automatically collect certain logistical information in server logs, including information about how you use various features of our service and information about the number, frequency and length of each session. We treat this information as personally identifiable information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, this information is used in the aggregate only.

We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies" when you use the Service. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website. Among other things, cookies help us to improve the Service and your experience. If we link cookies to any personally identifiable information, we will treat this information as personally identifiable information. If you wish to block, erase or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions. However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services made available via the Service.

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, or Service Providers (as defined below) is not covered by this Policy.

We may use Web beacons or similar technology on the Service and in our App. We may link the information gathered by clear gifs to your personally identifiable information. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Service or in emails relating to the Service to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Service, such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.
