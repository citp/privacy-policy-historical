<h3>gzzt.org Privacy Policy</h3>
<br><br>
The privacy of gzzt.org visitors is important to us. At
    gzzt.org, we recognize that the privacy of our
    visitor’s personal information is important. Here is
    information on what types of personal information we receive and
    collect when you visit gzzt.org, and how we safeguard your
    information. We never sell your personal information to third
    parties.
<br><br>
  <b>  Log Files</b>
<br>
    We collect and use the data contained in log files. The
    information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol)
    address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw
    Cable), the browser used to visit our site (such as Internet
    Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which
    pages you visited within our site.
<br><br>
    <b>Cookies and Web Beacons</b>
<br>
    We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal
    preferences when you visit our site. This could include only
    showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login
    to some of our features, such as forums.
<br><br>
    <b>Third Party Advertisements</b>
<br>
    We also use third party advertisements on gzzt.org to
    support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology
    such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site,
    which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through
    the Google AdSense program) information including your IP
    address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and
    in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is
    generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real
    estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing
    certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing
    cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
<br><br>
Google uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies visit:

Google preferences: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/

<br><br>
    Also you can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies
    or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing
    preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security;
    however, this can affect how you are able to interact with our
    site as well as other websites. This could include the inability
    to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or
    accounts.
