   <p><b><a name="cookies">About Cookies and how they are used</a></b></p>

   <p>As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, 
   <i>CWahi</i> uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. 
   A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web 
   server and stored on your computer's hard drive in a text file called 
   "cookie.txt". All sites on <i>CWahi</i> where you are prompted to, require 
   that you accept cookies.</p>

   <p>We use cookies to:

   </p><ol class="small">

    <li>Estimate our visitors. When a browser accesses <i>CWahi</i> it is given 
    a unique cookie which may then be used to determine if the surfer is a 
    registered Member or visitor, and how often the surfer returns to see us. 
    It is also used to help target advertisements based on member preferences.  
    </li><li>Tell us who you are and to access your preferences in order to give you 
    a more personalized service. Cookies are set when you register, login, and 
    are modified when you logout of your account or leave our site. 
    </li><li>Keep track of your progress and number of entries in some promotions, 
    sweepstakes and contests.
    </li><li>Measure traffic patterns, based on which areas of <i>CWahi</i> are most 
    visited, and enables us to develop or modify the area to serve better 
    content and experiences.
    </li><li>Advertising networks that serve ads onto <i>CWahi</i> may also use their 
    own cookies.
   </li></ol><p></p>

   <p><i>CWahi</i> also collects IP addresses for administration purposes. In 
   addition, <i>CWahi</i> Mail/CWMail includes IP addresses in outgoing mail 
   message headers.</p>

   <p><b><a name="gather">What personal information is collected from you</a></b></p>

   <p><i>CWahi</i> collects information in several ways:</p>

   <p></p><ol class="small">

    <li>Some personal information is gathered when you sign up for your 
    account. During the signup process, <i>CWahi</i> asks for your name, 
    alternate email address, birth date, gender, address, zip/postal code, and 
    personal interests. 
    </li><li>The more (accurate) information you volunteer when you join us, the 
    easier it is for us to customize your personal <i>CWahi</i> experience. This 
    information allows us to provide you with more suitable content for your 
    interests, and you are able to take full advantage of <i>CWahi</i>' many 
    programs and offerings.
    </li><li>In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at 
    other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes, 
    contest or promotion sponsored by <i>CWahi</i> and/or our many partners; and 
    when you submit a listing for a web site. If you contact <i>CWahi</i> we may 
    keep a record of that correspondence. <i>CWahi</i> also occasionally asks 
    Members to complete surveys that we use for service research.
   </li></ol><p></p>

   <p><b><a name="used">How does <i>CWahi</i> use my information?</a></b></p>

   <p><i>CWahi</i>' main goal is to provide you, the Member, with a 
   content-appropriate and interesting experience. In order to provide free 
   services to our Members, we display advertisements. By knowing a little 
   about you, including your preferences, <i>CWahi</i> is able to deliver 
   interesting advertisements and content, which makes your on-line experience 
   with <i>CWahi</i> that much better.</p>

   <p>Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience 
   they want to reach. <i>CWahi</i> takes the advertisement and displays it to 
   Members meeting that criteria. The advertiser never has access to your 
   account information. Only <i>CWahi</i> has access to Member's accounts. This 
   kind of advertisement targeting is done with ads as well as promotional 
   email. You will only receive special offers via email from <i>CWahi</i> if 
   you have indicated in your account preferences that you would like to 
   receive them. Member newsletters are delivered to all Members of 
   <i>CWahi</i>, and are the only correspondence that you may not opt-out of.</p>

   <p><i>CWahi</i> does research on our Members' demographics, interests, and 
   behavior based on the information provided to us upon signup, during a 
   promotion, or from our server log files. We do this to better understand 
   and serve our Members.</p>

   <p><b><a name="who">Who is collecting information?</a></b></p>

   <p>When you are on a <i>CWahi</i> site and are asked for personal information, 
   you are sharing that information with <i>CWahi</i> alone, unless we 
   specifically state otherwise. At times we may introduce a "co-branded" 
   service or promotion to you in conjunction with a sponsor or partner 
   company, and at that time it may be necessary for us to share your personal 
   information with the sponsor or partner. If you do not want your data to be 
   shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that 
   particular service or participate in that promotion. </p>

   <p>Please be aware that <i>CWahi</i> advertisers or web sites that have links on 
   our site may collect personal information about you. The information 
   gathering practices of those web sites are not covered by this privacy 
   statement. </p>

   <p><b><a name="sharing">With whom does <i>CWahi</i> share my information?</a></b></p>

   <p>As a rule, <i>CWahi</i> will not disclose any of your information except when 
   we have your permission or under special circumstances, when required by law, 
   or under the events described below. </p>

   <p></p><ul class="small">
    <li><u>Sponsors &amp; Partners</u>: <i>CWahi</i> may share your personal 
    information to business partners or sponsors, but this is specifically 
    described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the 
    data. Some or all data collected during a <i>CWahi</i> promotion may be 
    shared with a sponsor. If personally identifying data about you will be 
    shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. 
    </li><li><u>Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Collective</u>: Under confidentiality 
    agreements, <i>CWahi</i> may match Member information with third party data. 
    Also, <i>CWahi</i> discloses Member statistics (for example, 81% of our 
    Members are American) in order to describe our services to prospective 
    partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful 
    purposes. 
    </li><li><u>Other:</u> <i>CWahi</i> may also disclose account information in rare 
    cases when we have reason to believe that this information is necessary to 
    identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be 
    violating our Terms of Service or may be causing injury to or interference 
    with (either intentionally or unintentionally) <i>CWahi</i>' rights or 
    property, other <i>CWahi</i> Members, or anyone else that could be harmed by 
    such activities. <i>CWahi</i> may provide account information when we believe 
    in good faith and are notified properly that the law requires it, and for 
    administrative and other reasons to improve our service.
   </li></ul><p></p>

   <p><b><a name="choice">What are my choices regarding my information?</a></b></p>

   <p><i>CWahi</i> may occasionally send you email regarding our products and 
   services. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are 
   interested in receiving offers or information from <i>CWahi</i> and our 
   partners, we may send you e-mail about products and services that we feel 
   may be of interest to you from time to time. Only <i>CWahi</i> (or agents 
   working on behalf of <i>CWahi</i> and under confidentiality agreements) will 
   send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not 
   object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply 
   tell us when you give us your personal information. Please note that the 
   Member Newsletter is a mandatory part of your Membership agreement, as 
   stated in the Terms of Service.</p>

   <p>You do have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser 
   preferences, you have the option to: </p>

   <p></p><ul class="small">
    <li>accept all cookies
    </li><li>to be notified when a cookie is set
    </li><li>or to reject all cookies. 
   </li></ul><p></p>

   <p>If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those 
   <i>CWahi</i> services that require registration in order to participate. This 
   includes the secure transactions for paid <i>CWahi</i> services. </p>

   <p><i>CWahi</i> does not sell or rent Member information to anyone. If you do not 
   wish to have your information shared with a sponsor or partner company, you 
   simply do not participate in that promotion or service. By participating in 
   the above, you are granting <i>CWahi</i> permission to share your information 
   with the sponsor or partner company.</p>

   <p><b><a name="revise">What is <i>CWahi</i>' policy on allowing me to update, 
   revise, or delete my account information?</a></b></p>

   <p>You may edit your <i>CWahi</i> Account Information at any time by logging into 
   your <i>CWahi</i> account, and clicking on "Account Setup". If you have 
   forgotten your password, please <a href="mailto:user@&lt;i&gt;CWahi&lt;/i&gt;.net">click here</a> 
   to contact our helpdesk. Depending on when you signed up for your account, 
   the Help Desk personnel may need to ask you some verifying questions before 
   giving you your password. Please note that your IP address and other 
   identifying attributes will be recorded for security reasons when requesting 
   passwords. This is to protect our Members from external vandalism. </p>

   <p><b><a name="secure">What security precautions are in place to protect my 
   information?</a></b></p>

   <p>Your <i>CWahi</i> Account is protected by a password you assign to it, so that 
   only you have access to this personal information. You may edit your 
   Information, including your password, by logging into your account using 
   your <i>CWahi</i> Membername and password. </p>

   <p>We highly suggest that you do not give your password to anyone. <i>CWahi</i> 
   will never ask you for your password for any reason, and we do not require 
   it to review or administer your account. Remember to log out of your 
   <i>CWahi</i> account when you have finished working, and shut your browser 
   off. This is especially important in the case of a shared or publicly 
   accessible computer.</p>

   <p><i>CWahi</i> is a global service, and has members all over the world. When you 
   give <i>CWahi</i> personal information, that information may be sent to 
   servers outside of the country where you originally entered the information, 
   such as to Canada or other countries. In addition, that information may be 
   used, stored and processed outside of the country where you entered that 
   information. Whenever <i>CWahi</i> handles personal information as described 
   above, regardless of where this occurs, <i>CWahi</i> takes steps to ensure 
   that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the Terms 
   of Service and this Privacy Policy.</p>

   <p>No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. So 
   while we strive to protect your personal information, <i>CWahi</i> cannot 
   ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from 
   our on-line products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we 
   receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on 
   our servers.</p>

   <p><b><a name="general">What else should I know about my privacy?</a></b></p>

   <p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal 
   information on-line in guestbooks, message boards, through email, in chat, by 
   entering contests, posting a contact reference on your website, etc. - that 
   information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post 
   personal information on-line that is accessible to the public, you may 
   receive unsolicited messages that are completely beyond <i>CWahi</i>' control 
   and responsibility.</p>

   <p>Ultimately, Members are solely responsible for their actions when on-line, 
   and for keeping their passwords, and all other personal information private.</p>

   <p>This policy may change periodically and without notice.</p>
