These third parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information and to only use it for the purposes for which they have been engaged by us.

Notwithstanding the above, we may share aggregate or de-identified information about users with other third parties for marketing, advertising, research or other purposes. For example, if we display advertisements on behalf of a third party, we may share aggregate, demographic information with that third party about the users to whom we displayed the advertisements.

**Cookies** **and Other Tracking Technologies**

When you interact with the Site, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful. We may use or engage others to use cookies, clear gifs and Flash LSOs to track user activity and collect Site data. We may combine this information with other personal information we have collected from you, and may use this combined information for future marketing initiatives and to help us improve our website presentation and your overall shopping experience. 

_**Cookies.**_ Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based cookies.

  * Session Cookies: Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged in to the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests, store the items you have added to your shopping cart, and verify your identity after you have logged in and as you move through our Site.

  * Persistent Cookies: **** Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, which may be combined with other user information.




_**Third Party Cookies**_ _._ In addition, we may permit certain third party cookies to be placed on our Site. For example, we may engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable Site data. We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Site and services and to analyze usage. We do not provide these third parties with any personal information that we have collected about you.

In addition, we may also work with select partners to distribute web advertisements based on our customers' internet browsing patterns. We do not provide these third parties with personal information. You may opt out of many of these ad networks, at any time, by going here: http://www.networkadvertising.org and following the instructions to opt-out. We do not have access to or control over these third party cookies nor does this Privacy Policy cover such third parties' collection and use of data.

_**Disabling Cookies**_. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Site visitors who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Site; however, many site features, such as the shopping cart, will not function if you disable cookies.

_**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**_. We or the third parties we engage to track and analyze Site data may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to help us better manage content on the Site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages.

_**Flash Cookies**_. We may use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your Site preferences, to personalize your visit, or to display content based upon what you view on our Site. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. We do not have access to or control over these third party cookies nor does this Privacy Policy cover such third parties' use of data. 

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. In addition, you can not control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash cookies through your browser. To learn how to manage your settings for Flash cookies, visit http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118.

"I prefer not to receive direct mail advertisements, such as periodic catalogs and mailings regarding products and services, special promotions or upcoming events." (Please note that direct mail requests may take up to six to eight weeks to become effective.)

**Links to Other Websites and Services**  
Websites provided by C. Wonder may include links to other Internet sites maintained by third parties. C. Wonder provides these links to you solely as a convenience, and the inclusion of these links and associated sites does not imply endorsement by C. Wonder of the linked sites. You access these sites at your own risk and by accessing them you leave C. Wonder's website. Linked sites are not under the control of C. Wonder and C. Wonder is not responsible for the contents of these sites.

**Children's Privacy**  
This site is not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from, or target our Site to, children under the age of 13. If we become aware that any child under the age of 13 has submitted any personal information to C. Wonder through the Site, we will delete his or her information from our files.

**Security**  
We maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information transmitted to us using this website. For example, to guard your information, our website uses SSL technology, which encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only C. Wonder is able to decode this information. To be sure your connection is secure, look at the bottom status bar of your browser window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser) the SSL is active and your information is secure. Most browsers offer additional security alerts as well. If for some reason you are unable to connect to our secure server, please email us at [customercare@cwonder.com](mailto:customercare@cwonder.com) to place an order by email. You should be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security all of the time.

There are also certain steps you should take to safeguard your account and information. For example, you should select a secure password that only you know, and should always sign out of your account when finished. It is your responsibility to protect the confidentiality of your password in order to prevent unauthorized access to your account. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account and password. You should immediately change your password and notify us if you discover or suspect any unauthorized use of your account.

**Changes** **to this Privacy Policy**  
This policy replaces all previous disclosures we may have provided you about our information practices. We reserve the right to change this policy, and to apply any changes to information previously collected, as permitted by law. If there are material changes to this policy, or if our information practices change materially with regard to personal information that we have previously collected from you, we will notify you by posting the policy changes on our website with a new effective date and/or notifying you by [email], and will give you the choice of opting out of the material changes.

**Protecting Your Personal Information**  
You may come in contact with websites, e-mails or texts that try to lure you into providing personal information with the offer of a C. Wonder gift card. C. Wonder does not sponsor these offers nor are we affiliated with the promotion originators. If you become aware of any potentially fraudulent activity on a website or in an e-mail or text, please forward the information to [customercare@cwonder.com](mailto:customercare@cwonder.com)  so that we can follow up. We take these matters, and the protection of our customers' sensitive information, very seriously.
