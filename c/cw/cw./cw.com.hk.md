### What information does IDG Hong Kong's Web sites collect and how is it used?

IP addresses, access date and time, browser type and version, referrer URLs of all visitors. This data is used solely for the purpose of analyzing traffic on IDG Hong Kong's Web sites. This information enables us to better tailor our content to your interests, and to help our advertisers better understand the audience they are reaching. Our site is completely free, and is supported by paid advertisements and it is therefore critically important for us to be able to identify our audience. Information is only shared with advertisers or any other third parties in aggregate form. We are also firmly committed to identifying whether information presented on our sites is written by our editorial staff or is contributed by a user or vendor.

**IP Addresses**

For each visitor to our site, our web server automatically records the visitor's domain and IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. IDG Hong Kong makes no attempt to link these IP addresses with personal information, such as names or e-mail addresses, under any circumstance.

**Newsletter**

In order to subscribe to our various newsletters <http://www.idg.com.hk/subscription/> we do require the following information to be provided to us such as, your name, title, address, phone number, fax number and or email address. The fields are clearly marked within each field for proper identification.

**Choice/Opt-out**

Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our subscription form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who subscribe to our services, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the instruction in the e-mail, e-mail us at [circ_hk@idg.com.hk](mailto:circ_hk@idg.com.hk) or write request to our Circulation Department.

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.

**Surveys & Contests**

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

We deliver these messages, and we never allow email addresses or other contact information out of our control. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary, for the administration of prizes, rewards, or to respond to customer service requests.
