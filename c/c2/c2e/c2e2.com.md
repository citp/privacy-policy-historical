# Privacy Policy - C2E2 - Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo - April 26-28, 2013

Reed Exhibitions and C2E2 respect the information provided by our customers. Because we gather certain types of information when our customers communicate with us, we believe you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the information we capture and the use of that information. This privacy statement discloses the type of information we capture about our customers, how we use it to communicate with our customers, and how you can request to no longer receive communications from C2E2.

## US Policy

C2E2 is produced and managed by Reed Exhibitions (RX-US), a division of Reed Elsevier, Inc. This privacy policy applies to all RX-US offices and conforms to the spirit of the Reed Exhibitions Privacy Policy, which can be found at [www.reedexpo.com](http://www.reedexpo.com/).

## Our Customers

This policy applies to all customers of C2E2 and RX-US, who include but are not limited to, our show exhibitors, show visitors, conference visitors, customer inquiries, speakers, press, and other individuals with whom RX-US maintains business relationships or communications.

## Customer Information and Use

Two primary types of information are gathered about our customers:

Financial Information is payment information used for or gathered during the registration process and includes, but is not limited to, credit card numbers, financial institutions, and expiration dates. This information is not used for any purpose other than that for which it is being provided to us, and is used only to the extent necessary for processing the transaction or to facilitate future transactions.

Professional Information includes, but is not limited to, name, address, company name, company address, phone number, fax number, and email address, as well as questions answered on survey or registration forms. Data captured during a customer's visit to the C2E2 website, as well as during a visit with a C2E2 customer is also considered professional information and may also be stored in our customer database for our internal use. Professional information may be, upon the consent of C2E2, shared with other organizations or C2E2 customers for the purpose of facilitating business relationships believed by RX-US to be in our customers' best interests.

## Opting Out

RX-US will accept, implement and maintain any customer request to opt out of future communication from C2E2, RX-US, or a third party to whom C2E2 provided the customer's information. If you would like to opt out of communications you are receiving from C2E2, RX-US, or a third party contacting you on behalf of C2E2, please visit the [privacy website](http://www.recusprivacy.com/) and enter the information requested so we may thoroughly implement your request within 10 days of receipt.

## Security

This site utilizes a secure server to protect your financial and professional information. Secure server software is used to encrypt the information sent between your Internet browser and our Internet site. This ensures the security of your professional and financial transaction details when using the site. We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information you have given to us and may, on occasion, request proof of identity before we disclose any professional information to you.

## Method of Transaction Security

Products of C2E2 use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to safeguard customer information during online transactions. SSL encryption is the generally accepted method of transaction security in online ordering.
