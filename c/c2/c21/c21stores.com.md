By combining this information we are better able to communicate with you about our products, special events and promotional purposes and to personalize your shopping experience.

Century 21 Department Store will not rent or sell your email address for any reason.

We may also work with select partners to distribute web advertisements based on your internet browsing patterns. These advertising companies collect anonymous information about your visits to our website through the use of a cookie. This technology allows them to develop our advertising so that it directly relates to offers that may be of interest to you. These partners never collect personally identifiable information, however, if you'd prefer, you may opt out at any time by [clicking here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). If you delete your cookies, use a different browser, or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.

We do not share credit card information with third parties except for the purpose of processing payment for products you've ordered and as required by law. In addition, we may disclose credit card and other information we collect from you with an outside company with which we have contracted for their services to protect against fraud and the unauthorized use of credit and gift cards.

In addition to personal information, we collect information about your visits to and use of the site that is not personally identifiable. For example, our site uses cookies, which are small information files that are sent to your computer and stored on your hard drive. Cookies ease your use of the site, and provide us with information about your use of the site–for example, the pages that you view. If you have registered with us, then your computer will store an identifying cookie which will save you time each time you re-visit the C21Stores.com site, by remembering your email address for you when you interact with the site. You can change the settings on your browser to prevent cookies being stored on your computer without your explicit consent, but if you do not permit your browser to accept cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of the features of the site. We may also collect the IP address through which you access the Internet to use our site. Your IP address will typically be provided by your Internet service provider, your employer or the business or institution that provides you with access to the Internet. An IP address is not, by itself, personal information. We may use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which you and other guests visit the sites, and the patterns of site use. We may also combine IP addresses with personal information. To the extent that your IP address is combined with personal information, it will be treated as personal information. The site may also collect non-personal information through other technical methods.

We use the non-personal information collected through technology for a number of purposes, including tracking and enhancing your experience on our site. We also may use the information gathered by technology to analyze the traffic patterns on our site, such as the frequency with which you and others visit various parts of the site. We may send HTML emails to you if you’ve registered with C21Stores.com and those emails may contain data or routines that allow us to determine whether you have opened those emails, clicked on links in those emails or forwarded those emails to others.

We may disclose aggregate, anonymized statistics about the number of visitors to this site or number of purchases made as required by our investors. We use an independent measurement and research company to gather data regarding the visitors to this site on our behalf using cookies and code which is embedded in the site. Both the cookies and the embedded code provide statistical information about visits to pages on the site, the duration of individual page views, paths taken by visitors through the site, data on visitors' screen settings, and other general information. C21Stores.com uses and stores this type of information, along with that obtained from other cookies used on the site, to help it improve the services to its users.

We do not knowingly collect or store personal information from children under 13, even in aggregate. If we learn that we have done so we will endeavor to delete such personal information as soon as possible.
