<p>When you visit a website, certain personal information about you can be collected
  automatically. When you browse through our site, read pages, or download information,
  we collect certain information to measure how many visitors come to the different
  parts of the site so we can make the site more useful. </p>

    assigned to your computer when you go on the Web.<br>
        <br>

  </li>
  <li> for law enforcement reasons. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other possible uses of your information:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
  <li>We will only use personal identifying information to respond to you, in
    which case various people may need to see the information you provide in

<h2><a name="sites"></a>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>Our website has links to many other federal agencies, and, in a few cases,
  to private organizations, foreign governments and international organizations.
  You should be aware that:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
  <li>If you access another site through a link we provide, you are subject to
    the privacy policy of that site.<br>
        <br>
  </li>
  <li> Reference in this referred website to commercial products, services, manufacturers,
    or companies does not constitute an endorsement by the U.S. government, the
    Department of Health and Human Services, or FDA.<br>
      <br>
  </li>
  <li> FDA is not responsible for the contents of any pages referred from its
    website.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#statement">back to top</a></p>
<p><img src="/graphics/blkpixel.gif" alt="" width="100%" height="1"></p>
<h2><strong><a name="web"></a>Web Site Content</strong></h2>
<p>The health and medical information on our website is not intended to take
  the place of advice or treatment from healthcare professionals. It is also
  not intended to substitute for the users' relationships with their own health
  care/pharmaceutical providers. </p>
<p>The <em><a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm">Code
      of Federal Regulations</a></em> is the authoritative source for FDA regulations. </p>
<p><a href="#statement">back to top</a></p>
<p><img src="/graphics/blkpixel.gif" alt="" width="100%" height="1"></p>
<h2><strong><a name="information"></a>Information Quality</strong></h2>
<p>FDA is dedicated to:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
  <li>ensuring that all information it publishes reflects a level of quality
    corresponding to the nature and timeliness of the information<br>
        <br>
  </li>
  <li> disseminating all its data as broadly and promptly as possible so that
    the public can benefit from FDA's mission to promote and protect the public
    health. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In keeping with this commitment and in accordance with
  Public Law 106-554 and Office of Management and Budget requirements, HHS and
  FDA have developed information quality guidelines establishing quality assurance
  policies, standards, and processes. </p>
<p>The HHS guidelines are available at <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/infoquality/">http://www.hhs.gov/infoquality/</a>.
  The FDA guidelines are at <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/infoquality/fda.html">http://www.hhs.gov/infoquality/fda.html</a>.</p>

<h2><strong><a name="linking" id="linking"></a>Linking To or Copying Information
    On the FDA Website</strong></h2>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, the contents of the FDA Website (www.fda.gov)--both
  text and graphics--are not copyrighted. They are in the public domain and may
  be republished, reprinted and otherwise used freely by anyone without the need
  to obtain permission from FDA. Credit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
  as the source is appreciated but not required.</p>
<p>People are also free to link to any URL on FDA's site. FDA's preference is
  that people link to the material on the FDA site (rather than copying it to
  their personal Websites) because the Agency continuously updates the information
  on the Website as better information becomes available. A person copying documents
  to another Website, instead of linking to them, would then have to monitor
  the original documents to know when these documents were updated by FDA or
  else risk giving bad or incorrect advice to visitors to their Website. Providing
  consumers or health professionals with advice that is not fully up-to-date
  can lead to serious public health consequences. Providing industry advice that
  is not fully up-to-date can lead to companies being out of compliance with
  regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>If a person, nonetheless, decides to copy content or images, FDA strongly
  recommends that the copied item lists the date that the material was copied
  and provides a link back to its source on the FDA Website. Users can then see
  for themselves if the copied material has been updated or changed.</p>
<p>FDA appreciates being informed about the use of Website materials. Contact
  FDA, HFI-50, Rockville, MD 20857 or e-mail <a href="mailto:webmail@oc.fda.gov">webmail@oc.fda.gov</a>.</p>

<h2><strong><a name="pop"></a>Pop-Up Advertisements</strong></h2>
<p>When visiting our website, your Web browser may produce pop-up advertisements.
  These advertisements were most likely produced by other websites you visited
  or by third-party software installed on your computer. FDA doesn’t produce
  pop-up ads and doesn’t endorse or recommend products or services for
  which you may view a pop-up ad on your computer screen while visiting our site.</p>

<h2><strong><a name="intrusion"></a>Intrusion Detection</strong></h2>
<p>This site is maintained by the U.S. government and protected by various provisions
  of Title 18 of the U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18 are subject to criminal
  prosecution in federal court. </p>
<p>For site security purposes and to ensure that the site remains available to
  all users, we employ software programs that monitor traffic and identify unauthorized
  attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. In the
  event of authorized law enforcement investigations, and pursuant to any required
  legal process, information from these sources may be used to help identify
  an individual.</p>
