When you log on to CFNC.org, your browser will automatically transmit to CFNC.org's server the IP address of your computer, type of browser you are using and certain other information relating to your computer and its use. Although your browser transmits this information, Pathways of North Carolina does not associate the IP address of your computer or any of this other information transmitted by your browser with any personally identifiable information regarding you.

WITH WHOM PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED   
In each of the circumstances described below, data specifically required to perform a task you request will be made available to a recipient you designate:

  * If you submit an application for admission to a college or other educational institution, the personal data required to transmit that application will be provided on your behalf to the admissions office of the institution to which you are applying.   

  * If you start an application for admission to a college or other educational institution, your name and other data entered on that application may be provided to the admissions office of that institution, even though you have not yet submitted that application to that institution.   

  * If you request that a copy of your electronic high school transcript be sent to a college or other educational institution, the personal data required to transmit that request will be provided on your behalf to the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction and the admissions office of the institution to which you have requested the transcript be delivered.   

  * If you request that your data be transferred to FAFSA on the Web to help you fill out your federal financial aid application, data relevant to that application will be provided to a processor specified and authorized to process your financial aid applications (FAFSA) by the U.S. Department of Education.   

  * If you request that a college or other educational institution send you material, your contact information will be provided to that institution.   

  * Unless you opt out, your My CFNC profile will automatically be associated with the specific high school you select on the Student Planner section of CFNC.org. Information saved in your My CFNC profile will be made available to qualified educational professionals at the school you select. Please be aware that those whom you have authorized will be permitted to view personally identifying information about you unless you opt-out. If you do not opt-out, this will constitute consent to share education records under Family Educational Right and Privacy Act (FERPA).  




UNCGA, which administers the Pathways of North Carolina program, will have access to your personally identifying information. UNCGA has agreed to treat all personally identifying information that you entered on CFNC.org and which has been made available to UNC as educational records under the provisions of the Family Educational Right and Privacy Act (FERPA), and on that basis the personally identifying information will receive from UNCGA the privacy protections afforded by FERPA.

When visiting CFNC.org, you may link from CFNC.org to other websites for a variety of purposes such as visiting an official college website. This Pathways of North Carolina privacy statement does not apply to any other website, including websites to which CFNC.org may be linked. For your protection, we recommend that you read and understand the privacy policy at any website prior to providing personal information on that website.  
  
   
  
SECURITY MEASURES TO PREVENT MISUSE OF INFORMATION ENTRUSTED TO PATHWAYS OF NORTH CAROLINA   
Pathways of North Carolina causes the data you input to be encrypted when in route between your browser and the CFNC.org server and when in route between the CFNC.org server and some other browser or server. This practice helps prevent unauthorized third parties from intercepting and gaining access to your private data during transmission over the Internet. CFNC.org uses 56-bit, Secure Socket Layer encryption supported by both Netscape's and Microsoft's browsers.

Data residing on the CFNC.org server is password protected, and access is provided only to the account holder who created the password, anyone to whom that account holder entrusted the password, those employees who require such access to administer and maintain the CFNC.org system or to provide requested customer support to users of CFNC.org, and those employees of UNCGA who require such access to create reports based on aggregated information that is rendered no longer personally identifying in the aggregation process. Each employee who has access to the data residing on the CFNC.org server has agreed in writing to respect the privacy of all such personal data.

COOKIES  
A "cookie" is a small file that a website transfers to a user's computer, which may then be stored on its hard drive. Pathways of North Carolina uses cookies to remember you and personalize your web-viewing experience by keeping track of your session when logged on to CFNC.org. Cookies enable you to maintain continuity as you move from page to page on CFNC.org and to avoid the nuisance of being asked to provide the same information repeatedly. Cookies also allow us to make sure that only your browser can exchange information regarding your account with our servers. Cookies cannot be used to steal personal information or to gain access to information that you did not directly provide. The cookies we use are set when you log on to CFNC.org and are erased when you log off CFNC.org or completely close your browser.

Don't want cookies?  
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you don't want cookies, you can set your browser to disable or refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being used. You should note, however, that various CFNC.org services might not function properly when cookies are not utilized.

LINKS  
CFNC.org hosts links to other sites or resources having privacy policies that may differ from those of Pathways of North Carolina.

UNCGA and the colleges and the associations of colleges and agencies represented on CFNC.org do not have control over and do not endorse such external sites and resources. UNCGA, and the colleges, association of colleges or any other state agency represented on CFNC.org shall not be liable for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites or resources.

To delete personal information, (i) log on to CFNC.org, (ii) access your user profile, and (iii) delete the information you want to remove from CFNC.org using standard word-processing techniques. Please recognize that if you delete information, it will no longer be available on CFNC.org so that, for example, if a college to which you previously submitted an application were to attempt to retrieve that application from CFNC.org after you made the deletion the deleted information would no longer be accessible. Similarly, when accessed over CFNC.org, information that has been updated or otherwise modified will appear in its then-most current form, rather than in the form in which it may have been submitted at some earlier time.

AMENDING THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT   
Pathways of North Carolina may amend this Privacy Statement from time to time. If Pathways of North Carolina makes any substantial changes to this Privacy Statement concerning use of your personal identifying information, it will notify you by posting a message on the CFNC.org homepage.

The Authority also limits access to all the nonpublic information to persons who need to know that information to perform their Program services.

The nonpublic personal information the Authority has is used to initiate and maintain Accounts and otherwise to operate the Program. The Authority may disclose the information collected, as described above, to third parties in order to market jointly and to administer the programs and services that the Program Administrator administers on behalf of the Authority.

The Authority requires all of these persons to protect the confidentiality of nonpublic personal information. The Authority may also share Account information with the Participant's consent. The Authority does not otherwise provide nonpublic personal information to third parties, except to the attorneys, accountants, or auditors who represent the Authority or service providers thereto, and as otherwise permitted or required by law.
