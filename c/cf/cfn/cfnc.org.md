REASONS WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION  
Pathways of North Carolina collects personal information from you primarily for three reasons. The first reason is to perform a task on Pathways of North Carolina, such as filling out a specific college admission application, requested by you. The second reason is to enable you to submit in a convenient and efficient manner information that is likely to be needed when you complete college admission, financial aid and other applications and forms made available through Pathways of North Carolina or undertake a scholarship search on Pathways of North Carolina, and the third reason is to enable Xap to respond to your questions or contact you when necessary in connection with the functioning of Pathways of North Carolina. When the effective functioning of a Pathways of North Carolina module does not require personal information, none is collected, and any such module can be accessed without opening an account or providing any personal data. 

When you log on to Pathways of North Carolina, your browser will automatically transmit to Pathways of North Carolina's server the IP address of your computer, type of browser you are using and certain other information relating to your computer and its use.

MINIMUM AGE OF 13 REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AN ACCOUNT   
Pathways of North Carolina will not collect any information from persons who are not yet 13 years old.

If you are 13 years of age or older, you are encouraged to create an account on Pathways of North Carolina and to utilize all of Pathways of North Carolina, which will help you plan, prepare and pay for your future education. 

WAYS IN WHICH PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION MAY BE USED

  * We may use your identifying information to help diagnose problems with Pathways of North Carolina's server and to administer the Pathways of North Carolina website.   

  * Summary data representing a compilation of aggregate data representing Pathways of North Carolina users may be collected by Xap or UNCGA and provided to various entities including colleges and other educational institutions represented on Pathways of North Carolina. NO PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION IS MADE AVAILABLE AS PART OF THESE SUMMARY REPORTS, AND THE DATA IS AGGREGATED IN SUCH LARGE SETS THAT NO PERSONAL INFORMATION CAN BE IDENTIFIED. Some examples of summary data are the number of monthly visitors to the site, the number of admission applications submitted over Pathways of North Carolina, and the Pathways of North Carolina functions utilized by students in specified age or grade ranges. 



WITH WHOM PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED   
In each of the circumstances described below, data specifically required to perform a task you request will be made available to a recipient you designate: 

  * If you submit an application for admission to a college or other educational institution, the personal data required to complete that application will be provided on your behalf to the admissions office of the institution to which you are applying. 
  * If you start an application for admission to a college or other educational institution, your name and other data entered on that application may be provided to the admissions office of that institution, even though you have not yet submitted that application to that institution.   

  * If you request that your data be transferred to FAFSA on the Web to help you fill out your federal financial aid application, data relevant to that application will be provided to a processor specified and authorized to process your financial aid applications (FAFSA) by the U.S. Department of Education.   

  * If you request that a college or other educational institution send you material, your contact information will be provided to that institution.   

  * If you request that information saved in your MyMentor Portfolio be made available to your high school counselor, high school counseling office or someone else you designate to perform in a comparable role, those whom you have authorized will be permitted to view personally identifying information about you.

UNCGA has agreed to treat all personally identifying information that you entered on Pathways of North Carolina and which has been made available to UNC as educational records under the provisions of the Family Educational Right and Privacy Act (FERPA), and on that basis the personally identifying information will receive from UNCGA the privacy protections afforded by FERPA.

This Pathways of North Carolina privacy statement does not apply to any other website, including websites to which Pathways of North Carolina may be linked. For your protection, we recommend that you read and understand the privacy policy at any website prior to providing personal information on that website.   
  
   
  
SECURITY MEASURES TO PREVENT MISUSE OF INFORMATION ENTRUSTED TO PATHWAYS OF NORTH CAROLINA   
Pathways of North Carolina causes the data you input to be encrypted when in route between your browser and the Pathways of North Carolina server and when in route between the Pathways of North Carolina server and some other browser or server. This practice helps prevent unauthorized third parties from intercepting and gaining access to your private data during transmission over the Internet. Pathways of North Carolina uses 56-bit, Secure Socket Layer encryption supported by both Netscape's and Microsoft's browsers. 

Data residing on the Pathways of North Carolina server is password protected, and access is provided only to the account holder who created the password, anyone to whom that account holder entrusted the password, those employees of Xap who require such access to administer and maintain the Pathways of North Carolina system or to provide requested customer support to users of Pathways of North Carolina, and those employees of UNCGA who require such access to create reports based on aggregated information that is rendered no longer personally identifying in the aggregation process. Each Xap employee who has access to the data residing on the Pathways of North Carolina server has agreed in writing to respect the privacy of all such personal data. 

COOKIES

## North Carolina's National College Savings Program

#### Program Policies and Procedures for the Use and Disclosure of Nonpublic Personal Information

The North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority, through the Program Administrator and other service providers for North Carolina's National College Savings Program, has certain nonpublic personal information about Participants and Beneficiaries obtained from various sources. For example, from a Participant's Enrollment Agreement, the Authority knows the Participant's name, address and social security number, and the corresponding information for the Beneficiary of the Account established by the Participant. By the very nature of the Program, the Authority also knows how each Account is invested, each Account balance, the frequency and amount of the Contributions of each Account, and the nature of all Account withdrawals. The nonpublic personal information the Authority has is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards. The Authority also limits access to all the nonpublic information to persons who need to know that information to perform their Program services. 

The nonpublic personal information the Authority has is used to initiate and maintain Account investments and otherwise to operate the Program. The Authority may disclose the information collected, as described above, to a third party in order to market jointly the programs and services that the Foundation administers on behalf of the Authority. However, under these circumstances, the Authority will require that the third party, as a condition of its contract with the Authority or the Program Administrator, maintain the confidentiality of all nonpublic personal information. The Authority requires all of these persons to protect the confidentiality of nonpublic personal information about Participants and Beneficiaries. The Authority may also share information about Participants and Beneficiaries with the Participant's financial advisor designated by the Participant on the Enrollment Agreement. The Authority does not otherwise provide nonpublic personal information about Participants or Beneficiaries to third parties, except to the attorneys, accountants or auditors who represent the Program or service providers thereto, and as otherwise permitted or required by law. 

Capitalized terms appearing in this statement have the meanings assigned to them in the Program Description.
