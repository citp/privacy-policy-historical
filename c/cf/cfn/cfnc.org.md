Why We Collect Your Personal Identifying Information  
Pathways of North Carolina collects personal information from you for two reasons.

When you log on to Pathways of North Carolina, your browser will automatically transmit to Pathways of North Carolina's server the IP address of your computer and type of browser you are using. Although your browser transmits the IP address of your computer, Pathways of North Carolina does not associate this IP address with any personally identifiable information regarding you. Pathways of North Carolina does not collect any personally identifiable information other than what users submit and their browsers transmit.

Minimum Age of 13 to Establish an Account  
Pathways of North Carolina will not collect any information from persons who are not yet 13 years old. If you are under 13 years of age, you will not be permitted to create an account on Pathways of North Carolina.

Pathways of North Carolina uses 40-bit, Secure Socket Layer encryption supported by both Netscape's and Microsoft's browsers. 

Data residing on the Pathways of North Carolina server is password protected, and access is provided only to those employees of Xap who require such access to administer and maintain the Pathways of North Carolina system or to provide requested customer support to users of Pathways of North Carolina.

Such information may include your name together with your mailing address or electronic mail address and any information that you submit on an application for a scholarship, grant or loan. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you to anyone except as may be required or permitted by applicable federal or State law.

However, any information that reveals an account number for electronic payment as defined in G.S. § 147-86.20 and obtained pursuant to Articles 6A or 6B of the General Statutes is protected from disclosure under the Public Records Act and will remain secure for the limited time during which such information is retained by the Authority in order to complete the requested electronic payment transaction.

## North Carolina's National College Savings Program

#### Program Policies and Procedures for the Use and Disclosure of Nonpublic Personal Information

The North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority, through the Program Administrator and other service providers for North Carolina's National College Savings Program, has certain nonpublic personal information about Participants and Beneficiaries obtained from various sources. For example, from a Participant's Enrollment Agreement, the Authority knows the Participant's name, address and social security number, and the corresponding information for the Beneficiary of the Account established by the Participant. By the very nature of the Program, the Authority also knows how each Account is invested, each Account balance, the frequency and amount of the Contributions of each Account, and the nature of all Account withdrawals. The nonpublic personal information the Authority has is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards. The Authority also limits access to all the nonpublic information to persons who need to know that information to perform their Program services. 

The nonpublic personal information the Authority has is used to initiate and maintain Account investments and otherwise to operate the Program. The Authority may disclose the information collected, as described above, to a third party in order to market jointly the programs and services that the Foundation administers on behalf of the Authority. However, under these circumstances, the Authority will require that the third party, as a condition of its contract with the Authority or the Program Administrator, maintain the confidentiality of all nonpublic personal information. The Authority requires all of these persons to protect the confidentiality of nonpublic personal information about Participants and Beneficiaries. The Authority may also share information about Participants and Beneficiaries with the Participant's financial advisor designated by the Participant on the Enrollment Agreement. The Authority does not otherwise provide nonpublic personal information about Participants or Beneficiaries to third parties, except to the attorneys, accountants or auditors who represent the Program or service providers thereto, and as otherwise permitted or required by law. 

Capitalized terms appearing in this statement have the meanings assigned to them in the Program Description.
