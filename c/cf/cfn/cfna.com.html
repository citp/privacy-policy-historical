<p>
Credit First National Association ("CFNA," "we," "us," and "our" below) is committed to protecting your privacy. As a financial institution, we know that your trust in us is of central importance. This policy discloses our information use policies and practices in detail.
Please read it to learn more about the ways we protect the information we collect, and to find out how you can limit the information about you that we share within the our affiliated family of Companies ("affiliates") and with third parties unaffiliated with us. Be aware that limiting information sharing may result in you not learning about all the opportunities that may be important to you.
</p>
<p>
<b>Please read this policy and print a copy for your records.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>1. What Information We May Collect</b>
<br>
We may collect nonpublic personal information about you. This nonpublic personal information is personally identifiable information about you that we obtain in connection with our credit cards. For example, this information may include information regarding your name, address, social security number, account balance, payment history and purchasing patterns. We may collect information about you from the following sources:
</p><ul>
<li>	Information we receive from you on applications or otherwise;
</li><li>	Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or otherwise;
</li><li>	Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency; and
</li><li>	Information from public sources such as federal, state or local records.
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>
<b>2. Why Credit First Collects Information</b>
<br>
We collect information about you to:
</p><ul>
<li>	Accurately identify you;
</li><li>	Protect and administer your account and records;
</li><li>	Help us design or improve our products and services;
</li><li>	Understand your financial needs;
</li><li>	Offer you quality products and services; and
</li><li>	Comply with certain laws and regulations.
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>
<b>3. The Selective Sharing of Information</b>
<br>
We may share all the information we collect with our affiliates, as well as third parties unaffiliated with us. We reserve the right to share all information we collect as this policy describes.
</p>
<p>
We also disclose information to complete transactions initiated by you, when you request or authorize the disclosure, or if the disclosure is required by law. At times it is necessary to disclose information to enforce or apply the terms and conditions of an agreement we have with you and to protect the rights, property, or safety of Credit First, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
</p>
<p>
<b>4. Sharing within The CFNA Family of Companies ("Affiliate Sharing")</b>
<br>
Under the law, CFNA is permitted to share identification information with our affiliates, as well as information related to the transactions and experiences we have with our customers.
</p>
<p>
<b>5. Sharing with Carefully Selected Companies</b>
<br>
We share information with third parties so they may offer you additional products and services we believe may be beneficial to you. These third parties include:
</p><ul>
<li>	Financial service providers, such as insurance providers; and
</li><li>	Non-financial companies, such as direct marketers and merchandise vendors.
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>
We also disclose information to unaffiliated third parties as permitted by law. For example, we provide information to outside companies to perform services on our behalf, such as bill payments, mail house services, printing and account statementing; to governmental entities to respond to subpoenas; and to credit reporting agencies.
</p>
<p>
<b>6. Your Option</b>
<br>
If you prefer that CFNA not share information about you, you may restrict information sharing (other than those disclosures permitted by law).
Such an election means you "opt out" of information sharing.
<b>It is important to understand that an election to opt out of information sharing does not prohibit CFNA from contacting you about additional products or services. It only restricts the sharing of information with unaffiliated third parties and within the CFNA Family of Companies.</b>
The types of information that may be shared and the categories of companies with which it may be shared are those discussed in this policy.
</p>
<p>
<b>A. External Sharing - Unaffiliated Third Parties.</b> You may elect to opt out of information sharing with unaffiliated third party companies that are not part of the CFNA Family of Companies. Even if you opt out, we may still continue to share information with nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law.
</p>
<p>
<b>B. Internal Sharing - CFNA Family of Companies.</b> You also have the right to opt out of information sharing among CFNA's affiliates. If you elect to opt out of information sharing among CFNA's affiliates, CFNA is still permitted by law to share identification information and information we have on our experiences or transactions with you and our affiliates.
</p>
<p>
If you wish to opt out of information sharing, please call 1-800-321-3950 or write us at CFNA, BK-11/Customer Service, PO Box 81315, Cleveland, OH 44181-0315. When you call or write, please provide the account number for which you wish the opt out to apply. You will not be able to opt out through any means other than the toll-free number. If you opt out, you will be deemed to have opted out of information sharing for both External Sharing-Unaffiliated Third Parties and Internal Sharing-CFNA Family of Companies except as otherwise described above and as described by law. If you have a joint account, an opt out request by one individual will apply to all individuals on the account.
</p>
<p>
<b>7. Information Safeguards</b>
<br>
CFNA places great value on the relationship we share with you. Therefore, we work hard to safeguard information about that relationship. Except as otherwise described in this policy, we restrict access to your information to those employees who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your information.
</p>
<p>
<b>8. Changes to This Notice</b>
<br>
We may amend this policy at any time, and we will inform you of any changes as required by law.
</p>
<p>
<b>9. Former Customers</b>
<br>
If you end your relationship with CFNA, we will adhere to the information policies and practices described in this policy, as well as your opt out election with regard to information we have collected on you.
