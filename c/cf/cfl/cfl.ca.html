<p><span class="pn-title">Introduction</span><br><span class="pn-normal">The
site editor takes your right to privacy seriously, and wants you to
feel comfortable using this web site. This privacy policy deals with
personally-identifiable information (referred to as "data" below) that
may be collected by this site. This policy does not apply to other
entities that are not owned or controlled by the site editor, nor to
persons that are not employees or agents of the site editor, or that
are not under the site editor's control. Please take time to read this
site's <a href="/page/terms-of-use">terms of use</a>.</span></p>
<p><span class="pn-title">1. Collection of data</span><br><span class="pn-normal">Registration

which the site is configured) or unintentionally (such as, but not
limited to, subsequent to a successful act of intrusion by a third
party). As on many web sites, the site editor may also automatically
receive general information that is contained in server log files, such
as your IP address, and cookie information. Information about how
advertising may be served on this site (if it is the site editor's
policy to display advertising) is set forth below.</span></p>
<p><span class="pn-title">2. Use of data</span><br><span class="pn-normal">Data
may be used to customize and improve your user experience on this site.
Efforts will be made to prevent your data being made available to third
parties unless (ID 1033 0 1) provided for otherwise in this Privacy
Policy; (ii) your consent is obtained, such as when you choose to
opt-in or opt-out for the sharing of data; (iii) a service provided on
our site requires interaction a third party with or is provided by a
third party, such as an application service provider; (iv) pursuant to
legal action or law enforcement; (v) it is found that your use of this
site violates this policy, terms of service, or other usage guidelines,
or if it is deemed reasonably necessary by the site editor to protect
the site editor's legal rights and/or property; or (vi) this site is
purchased by a third party, in which case that third party will be able
to use the data in the same manner as set forth in this Policy. In the
event you choose to use links that appear on this web site to visit
other web sites, you are advised to read the privacy policies that
appear on those sites.</span></p>
<p><span class="pn-title">3. Cookies</span><br><span class="pn-normal">Like
many web sites, this web site sets and uses cookies to enhance your
user experience, such as retaining your personal settings.
Advertisements may appear on this web site and, if so, may set and
access cookies on your computer; such cookies are subject to the
privacy policy of the parties providing the advertisement. However, the
parties serving the advertising do not have access to this site's
cookies. These parties usually use non-personally-identifiable or
anonymous codes to obtain information about your visits to this site.<!-- **NOTE: that this last statement should be true but modify if necessary -->You can visit the  <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">Network Advertising Initiative</a> if you want to find out more information about this practice.</span></p>
