## Viewing and Making Changes to Your Personal Information

You may view and change much of your personal information by logging into your account at CPAP.com. You are required to revise your personal information quickly when a change occurs or if it is erroneous. Upon your request, and as soon as it is reasonably practicable, your account will be terminated and your personal information archived, based on your account activity and if allowed under subsequently relevant laws. We do keep a record of personal information from terminated accounts to abide by legal requirements, avert fraudulent activity, collect monies due to us, resolve disputes, regulate issues, cooperate with any investigations, enforce our CPAP.com User Agreement, and likewise take other actions legally allowed. 

You may also send us an email at cpap@cpap.com to request access or to request amendment of any personal information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. 

## Your California Privacy Rights

California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to compliance@cpap.com or write us at: CPAP.com 13235 N. Promenade, Stafford, TX 77477. 

## Security

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. Your information is protected by administrative, physical and technological security measures. We use many methods in good faith to safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access. However, as you may be aware, third parties may illegally intercept or access transmissions of your personal data or exchanges of information over the Internet, and there is the possibility that users may mistreat or mishandle your personal information that they find or gather during your interactions on the CPAP.com website. Consequently, while we do our best to safeguard your privacy, we in no way guarantee, and you should not have the expectation, that your personal data or exchanges of information over the Internet will always remain private. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal information in transit to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. 

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) software, which encrypts personal information you send to Company. 

Email messages are not typically secure so we do not recommend sending us any critical financial information such as credit cards numbers, bank account numbers, or similar information via email. If you choose to provide this type of information via email, you do so at your own risk. 

We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing via a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection which encrypts your data. 

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off of your CPAP.com account when finished using a shared computer. 

## Protected Health Information

Because we do not electronically submit payment for our products using the HIPAA transaction code sets electronically, we are not required to comply with the federal Health Insurance and Portability Act. However, we believe that information related to your medical care or “Protected Health Information” (PHI) is sensitive and should be protected. For further information about how we use or disclose your Protected Health Information please see Our Protected Health Information Privacy Policy or contact our Privacy Officer, c/o U.S. Expediters, Inc., 13235 N Promenade, Stafford, TX 77477, or email compliance@cpap.com. 

## General

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the changes on CPAP.com. In the event that we make any significant material change to this Privacy Policy, we may attempt to notify you by email or through a notice on Website, but are not required to do so. If your questions are not answered online, you may write to us at: CPAP.com Attn: Legal - Privacy Policy, 13235 N Promenade, Stafford, Texas 77477, or by using the contact us form.
