            	<h1 class="futura">Privacy Policy</h1>
                
                <p>This Privacy Policy explains how US Expediters, Inc. (CPAP.com) handles your personal information for the services we provide. It applies to the CPAP.com website and other related websites where a link to this policy appears at the bottom of the page. Some CPAP.com related websites (the "Sites") or websites we operate may be bound by a different privacy policy. The applicable policy on any of our domains will invariably be the policy that appears in the link at the bottom of each web page. With acceptance of our Privacy Policy and User Agreement and by using the CPAP.com website, you are specifically consenting to allow CPAP.com to collect, store, use, and disclose your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                
                <p>This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance for new users and on April 10th, 2008 for all existing users. </p>
                
                <h2 class="futura">Data Collection</h2>
                <p>You are allowed to browse our Sites without giving us any personal information about yourself. Once you have chosen to provide us with your personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us, and you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.</p>

                
                <p>We are allowed to collect and store the following personal information: </p>
                
                <ul class="text">
                	<li>names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical contact information, and sometimes credit card or other financial information used for verification of identity or payment for purchases;</li>                
                    <li>transactional information or data based on any of your activities on the Sites;</li>

                    <li>other information from third parties, such as such as demographic and traffic data, prescriptions, or for example, if you incur a debt to CPAP.com, we may run a credit check, as permitted by law, to collect such a debt; or if the information you provide cannot be verified, we may ask you to send us additional information.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2 class="futura">Third Parties</h2>
                <p> We do not sell your personal information to, or share it with third parties for their marketing purposes.

                <p>Unless specifically included herein, this Privacy Policy applies only to the use and disclosure of information we obtain from you. If you provide your information to others on any of our Sites or unrelated sites around the Internet, different rules may apply, since we in no way control the privacy policy of third parties.</p>
                
                <h2 class="futura">Usage</h2>

                <h2 class="futura">Our Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
                <p>We may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a Customer Review or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety.</p> 
                
                <p>We may also share your personal information as outlined below: </p>
                
                <ul class="text">

If your password is compromised, you may lose considerable authority over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Accordingly, if for any reason you have revealed or lost control of your password, then you should notify CPAP.com and change your password without delay.</p>

                  
                  <h2 class="futura">Viewing and Making Changes to Your Personal Information</h2>
                  <p>You may view and change much of your personal information by logging into your account at CPAP.com. You are required to revise your personal information quickly when a change occurs or if it is erroneous. Upon your request, and as soon as it is reasonably practicable, your account will be terminated and your personal information archived, based on your account activity and if allowed under subsequently relevant laws. We do keep a record of personal information from terminated accounts to abide by legal requirements, avert fraudulent activity, collect monies due to us, resolve disputes, regulate issues, cooperate with any investigations, enforce our <a href="/user-agreement.php">CPAP.com User Agreement</a>, and likewise take other actions legally allowed. </p>
                  
                  <h2 class="futura">Security</h2>
                  <p>Protecting and securing your information is of the highest priority to us. We consider the data we collect and your personal information to be an extremely valuable asset that should be protected. Your information is stored and processed on dedicated servers located in the United States that are protected by physical and technological security measures. We use many methods in good faith to safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access. However, as you may be aware, third parties may illegally intercept or access transmissions of your personal data or exchanges of information over the Internet, and there is the possibility that users may mistreat or mishandle your personal information that they find or gather during your interactions on the CPAP.com website. Consequently, while we go to great lengths to safeguard your privacy, we in no way guarantee, and you should not have the expectation, that your personal data or exchanges of information over the Internet will always remain private. Here is more about the security of your personal information.</p>
                  
                  <ul class="text">
                  	<li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts personal information you send to CPAP.com.</li>

                    <li>Email messages are not typically secure so we do not recommend sending us any critical financial information such as credit cards numbers, bank account numbers, or similar information via email. If you choose to provide this type of information via email, you do so at your own risk.</li>
                    <li>We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing via a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection which encrypts your data.</li>
                    <li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off of your CPAP.com account when finished using a shared computer.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h2 class="futura">Personal Health Information</h2>                  
                  <p>We are legally required to protect the privacy of your 'Personal Health Information', or 'PHI' for short. Additionally incorporated into this Privacy Policy is more information described in the PHI <a href="/phi-privacy-policy.php">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

                  <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the changes on CPAP.com.
