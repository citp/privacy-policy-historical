# Privacy Policy | Christ Presbyterian Academy

**Internet Privacy Policy**

Christ Presbyterian Academy (CPA) is pleased to provide information to all of its visitors about its online privacy policy. CPA uses its best efforts to protect the privacy of visitors to this website.

**  
Introduction**

The Academy's privacy policy sets out the ways CPA processes personal data. This privacy policy only relates to personal data collected by CPA via the cpalions.org website. This privacy policy does not apply to personal data provided to CPA by any other means or by means of any other website. Users should be aware that if they provide personal data to other companies, the privacy polices of those companies determine the uses for that information and CPA’s privacy policy will no longer apply.

**  
Types of Information Collected and How the Information Is Used**

CPA may gather personal information, such as first and last names, home addresses, email addresses, and credit card numbers, only when voluntarily submitted. If you make an online donation or purchase, or register for an event, personal information will be collected from you in order to process that donation or purchase, or complete your registration. If you update contact and/or student information online, personal information will be collected from you in order to process the update.

The information provided may be used to send materials that may be of interest to parents, students, prospective students, CPA alumni or CPA alumni families, and to others who visit our website and provide personal information. The information may include details regarding upcoming events, Academy news, or fund-raising campaigns. Our primary method of communication among CPA families is through email and the CPA website (cpalions.org).  If you do not wish to receive such materials, you must send an email to unsubscribe and requesting removal from the distribution list. The request must include the specific email address to be removed. 

**  
Sharing of Personal Information**

Companies may be engaged by CPA to perform a variety of functions, such as assisting with donation or payment collection, event registration and payment, admission inquiries, providing technical services for our Internet sites, etc. Such companies may have access to personal information if needed to perform certain functions. However, these companies may use such personal information only for the purpose of performing that function and may not use it for any other purpose. Other than as provided in this privacy policy, CPA does not sell, transfer or disclose personal information to third parties.

CPA reserves the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of the site, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or an investigation on a public safety matter.

If at any time, you would like us to correct or delete the personal information we have about you or if you would like to change your preferences for contacts from us, you can let us know by contacting us in writing with your request.
