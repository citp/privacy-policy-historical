<td><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">PRIVACY POLICY</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Last Updated: March 20, 2007</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">CpaHotSpot.com strives to offer
its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide
an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable
Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number)
subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter,
or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period."</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How we gather information from users</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How we collect and store information depends
on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate
and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information
when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request
certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You
may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests,
message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site.
Like most Web sites, CpaHotSpot.com also collects information automatically
and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our
visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider
or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your
visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password,
sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit,
or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement
while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also
gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose
not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser
to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access
certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name
and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features according
to your preferences.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What we do with the information we collect</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Like other Web publishers, we collect information
to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising.
We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Aggregated Information (information that
does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example,
we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information
obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g.,
to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).
Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers
and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally
Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We may use Personally Identifiable Information
collected on CpaHotSpot.com to communicate with you about your
registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy
policy; services and products offered by CpaHotSpot.com and other
topics we think you might find of interest.&nbsp;</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Personally Identifiable Information collected
by CpaHotSpot.com may also be used for other purposes, including
but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of
e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and
other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical
support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example)
may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted
by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business,
we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses.
In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.
We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at
other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law,
in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or
to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary.
Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such
cases.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">CpaHotSpot.com expects its partners,
advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware,
however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates
and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their
own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during
your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a
CpaHotSpot.com page, certain content that is actually created or
hosted by a third party. Also, through CpaHotSpot.com you may be
introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features,
contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. CpaHotSpot.com
is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You
should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when
providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional
partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to
attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about
you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and
may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you
have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available on
our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies
or other technology to gather information. CpaHotSpot.com does
not control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting
information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such
third parties.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily
disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat
areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and
used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited
messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond
the control of CpaHotSpot.com and this policy.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Children</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">CpaHotSpot.com does not knowingly
collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children
under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any
information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will
delete that information immediately. If you believe CpaHotSpot.com
has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at
the address listed below.</font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">CpaHotSpot.com reserves the right
to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically
for changes. Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes
to these terms will mean you accept those changes. Information collected
prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the rules
and laws that applied at the time the information was collected.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Governing law</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This policy and the use of this Site are
governed by Ontario law. If a dispute arises under this Policy we agree
to first try to resolve it with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator
in the following location: Toronto. Any costs and fees other than attorney
fees associated with the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If it proves impossible to arrive at a
mutually satisfactory solution through mediation, we agree to submit the
dispute to binding arbitration at the following location: Toronto, under
the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award
rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any court with jurisdiction
to do so.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">CpaHotSpot.com is controlled, operated
and administered entirely within Ontario. This statement and the policies
outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or
other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.</font></p></td>
