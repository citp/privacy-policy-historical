		<p>This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about the Canadian Psychiatric Association’s (“CPA”) practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide via this site. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information to this site. This site is intended for use by residents of Canada.</p>

		<p>For the purposes of this Policy, “Personal Information” means any information, recorded in any form, about an identified individual, or an individual whose identity may be inferred or determined from the information, but does not include business contact information. This policy does not cover any information, recorded in any form, about more than one individual where the identity of the individuals is not known and cannot be inferred from the information (“Aggregated Information”). CPA retains the right to use Aggregated Information in any way that it determines appropriate. </p>


		<p>In the event an individual has questions about (a) access to Personal Information; (b) the collection, use, management or disclosure of Personal Information; or (c) this Policy Statement, that person should contact CPA as follows:</p>

		<p><a href="mailto:CPA@cpa-apc.org">CPA@cpa-apc.org</a> or <a href="mailto:webmaster@cpa-apc.org">webmaster@cpa-apc.org</a><br>

<h4>Your Consent</h4>

<p><b>This Privacy Policy forms part of this Site’s <a href="/Public_Terms.asp"><b>Terms of Use</b></a>. Your use of this Site means that you have reviewed the Terms of Use and this Privacy Notice and agree that we may collect, use and disclose your Personal Information in accordance with both documents.  If you do not agree with these terms, you may choose not to use this Site, and are requested not to provide any Personal Information through this Site. </b></p> 


<p>This Privacy Policy is in effect as of November 1, 2003. Please review this Policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Information.  The CPA will from time to time review and revise its privacy practices and this Privacy Policy. Any amendments of this Policy will be posted on this Site. Policy changes will apply to the information collected from the date of posting of the revised Privacy Policy to this Site as well as to existing information held by the CPA at the time of amendment. </p>


<p>YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SITE AFTER ANY CHANGES OR REVISIONS TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY INDICATES YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THE TERMS OF SUCH REVISED PRIVACY POLICY. </p>


<h4>Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</h4>

<p>The CPA uses Personal Information provided on the site for different purposes to fulfil its mandate.  These purposes include:</p>

 	<blockquote><li><p>Acting as a professional association in support of psychiatrists in Canada;
 	</p></li><li><p>Providing services to Members;
 	</p></li><li><p>Providing continuing education and education courses to Members;
 	</p></li><li><p>Meeting any legal or regulatory requirement; and 
 	</p></li><li><p>Such other purposes consistent with the foregoing purposes.</p></li></blockquote>

<p>CPA’s use of Personal Information is limited to the purpose of fulfilling its mandate or a purpose consistent with that purpose and the CPA does not sell, trade, barter or exchange for consideration any Personal Information it has obtained.  Unless permitted by law, no Personal Information is collected about an individual, without first obtaining the consent of the individual to the collection, use and dissemination of that information. </p>


<p>Personal Information will be collected, to the extent possible, directly from the individual concerned except where it is reasonably necessary for the purpose of providing services to Members and where permitted by law.  </p>

<p>CPA may disclose your Personal Information to organizations that perform services on behalf of CPA.  Personal Information will only be provided to organizations providing services to CPA if they agree to use such information solely for the purposes of providing services to CPA and under the instruction of CPA and, with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Policy.</p>

<p>Please note that there are circumstances where the use and/or disclosure of Personal Information may be justified or permitted or where CPA is obliged to disclose information <i>without</i> consent.  Such circumstances may include:</p>

 	<blockquote><li><p>Where required by law or by order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or other governmental tribunal;
 	</p></li><li><p>Where CPA believes, upon reasonable grounds, that it is necessary to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of an identifiable person or group;
 	</p></li><li><p>Where it is necessary to establish or collect monies owing to CPA; 
 	</p></li><li><p>Where it is necessary to permit CPA to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that CPA may sustain; or
 	</p></li><li><p>Where the information is public.</p></li></blockquote>


<p>Where obliged or permitted to disclose information without consent, CPA will not disclose more information than is required.</p>


<h4>About Children</h4>

<p>CPA does not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone under the age of 18, especially children under 13, and does not use such information if it discovers that it is has been provided by a minor. </p>

<h4>Active Information Collection</h4> 

<p>The public site is not designed to actively collect information from its visitors.  In order to access and use the members-only portion of the site, members will need to provide certain Personal Information.  Such personal information will only be used for providing services and information to members.</p>

<h4>Passive Information Collection </h4>

<p>As you navigate through a Website, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data collection.  CPA uses Internet Protocol (IP) addresses on this site. The CPA uses your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our site, and administer and improve the site. </p>

<p>A "cookie" is a bit of information that a Web site sends to your Web browser that helps the site remember information about you and your preferences. "Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your Web browser window or otherwise turn your computer off. Session cookies are used to improve navigation on Web sites and to collect aggregate statistical information. The CPA’s site uses session cookies. </p>

<p>"Navigational data" ("log files", "server logs", and "clickstream" data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the site for market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors. The CPA’s site uses navigational data. </p>

<h4>Accuracy &amp; Retention</h4>

<p>CPA endeavours to ensure that any Personal Information provided and in its possession is as accurate, current and complete as necessary for the purposes for which CPA uses that information.</p>

<p>CPA retains Personal Information as long as CPA believes it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected.  Currently, the principal place in which CPA retains Personal Information is in the City of Ottawa, Ontario.  </p>


<h4>Access and Correction</h4> 

<p>The CPA permits the right of access and review of Personal Information about an individual held by the CPA. </p>

<p>If you believe the information about you is not correct, you may request an update of that information by sending a request to the <a href="mailto:webmaster@cpa-apc.org">Webmaster</a>. The CPA reserves the right not to change any Personal Information but will append any alternative text the individual concerned believes appropriate.  </p>

<p>CPA reserves the right to decline access to Personal Information where the information requested:</p>


<blockquote><p>(a)	Would disclose the Personal Information of another individual or of a deceased individual; 

</p><p>(b)	Would disclose business confidential information that may harm CPA or the competitive position of a third party; 

</p><p>(c)	Is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege; 

</p><p>(d)	Could reasonably result in: (i) serious harm to the treatment or recovery of the individual concerned; (ii) serious emotional harm to the individual or another individual; or (iii) serious bodily harm to another individual; 

</p><p>(e)	May harm or interfere with law enforcement activities and other investigative or regulatory functions of a body authorized by statute to perform such functions;

</p><p>(f)	Is not readily retrievable and the burden or cost of providing would be disproportionate to the nature or value of the information; or 

</p><p>(g)	Does not exist, is not held, or cannot be found by CPA. </p></blockquote>

<p>Where information will not or cannot be disclosed, the individual making the request will be provided with the reasons for non-disclosure.</p>

<p>Where information will be disclosed, the CPA will endeavor to provide the information in question within a reasonable time and no later than 60 days following the request. </p>

<p>The CPA will not respond to repetitious or vexatious requests for access. In determining whether a request is repetitious or vexatious, it will consider such factors as the frequency with which information is updated, the purpose for which the information is used, and the nature of the information.</p>


<p>To guard against fraudulent requests for access, the CPA will require sufficient information to allow it to confirm the identity of the person making the request before granting access or making corrections.</p>

<h4>Security</h4> 

<p>CPA takes reasonable steps to protect your personally identifiable information as you transmit your information from your computer to the CPA’s site and to protect such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. </p>

<p>As part of those precautions, we restrict access to Personal Information to those employees and external service providers we determine need to know that information in order that the CPA may provide its services.</p>

<p>In terms of communicating Personal Information to CPA, you may wish to note that there is no method of transmitting or storing data that is completely secure.  While the physical characteristics of each are different, mail, telephone calls, faxes and transmissions over the Internet are all susceptible to possible loss, misrouting, interception and misuse of the information being communicated or transmitted.  </p>

<p>As do many organizations, CPA attempts to strike a reasonable balance between security and convenience.  In communicating with you, CPA reserves the right to use a method of communication that is less secure than some of its less convenient alternatives.  An example of this is e-mail.  At this time, when we use e-mail, it is sent as unencrypted plain text.  We do this because CPA believes that many of our members, service providers and other third parties cannot readily process encrypted e-mail.  This is done for their convenience but has the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted e-mail.</p>

<p>You may have received a unique Client ID and created a password in order to use the secure portions of CPA’s web site. You are requested not to divulge your Client ID or password to anyone other than authorized CPA personnel and only for the purpose of permitting them to provide service to you.  </p>
  
<h4>Links to Other Websites</h4> 

<p>This site may contain links or references to other Websites.  Please be aware that CPA does not control other Websites and that, in any case, this Privacy Policy does not apply to those Websites.  We encourage you to read the privacy policy of every Website you visit.</p>
