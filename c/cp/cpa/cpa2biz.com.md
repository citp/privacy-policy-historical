# Privacy Policy

**AICPA, CPA2Biz, and Shared Services Limited Liability Company Joint Privacy Policy**

Version 1.5 Last updated on February 5, 2009 

######  1\. OUR COMMITMENT

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), CPA2Biz, and Shared Services Limited Liability Company (SSLLC) understand how important the protection of your personal information is to you. We are committed to protecting your privacy. We want to make sure you understand how the personal information you provide to us is being used as well as the choices that you have regarding this information. The following policy discloses our procedures surrounding this commitment. 

######  2\. ORGANIZATIONAL OVERVIEW

The AICPA is the premier national professional association for CPAs in the United States. Committed to member service and the public interest, the AICPA and its predecessors have been serving the accounting profession since 1887. The AICPA operates a Web domain under the URL <http://www.aicpa.org/> and has many Web destinations that link from this Web URL.

CPA2Biz is a separate, for-profit corporation. The AICPA has a partnership with CPA2Biz that calls for CPA2Biz to act as the exclusive online and offline marketing agent for AICPA products and services. In addition, through online and offline activities, CPA2Biz acts as a marketing and distribution agent for other third parties. 1 CPA2Biz also provides marketing and technology services to the AICPA for its wide array of products and services, such as continuing education, conferences, and literature to enhance CPAs' abilities to fulfill their professional needs. The CPA2Biz Web domain (sometimes referred to in this Privacy Policy as the CPA2Biz Site) is under the URL <http://www.cpa2biz.com/>.2

SSLLC is a 50/50 joint venture between the AICPA and the 50 state CPA societies, plus the CPA societies of Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. SSLLC was established in 2000 and is a separate, for-profit, legal entity. SSLLC negotiates agreements with service providers that allow the state CPA societies and the AICPA to reduce aggregate operating costs by securing savings on purchases and/or services by leveraging the collective buying power of its stakeholders and their members. SSLLC activities are conducted both online and offline. Related online activities result from activities connected to strategic sourcing providers. The customers and related parties of SSLLC include the AICPA, CPA2Biz, and the state CPA societies (henceforth referred to as the Entities).

The AICPA, CPA2Biz and SSLLC are henceforth called the Organizations.

On December 1, 2003, the AICPA launched Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems; hosted by a third-party hosting and application support provider. The member and other database information stored in the ERP, and CRM system can be collected and viewed by the AICPA and CPA2Biz. 

Any changes made to your personal information either offline or online at <http://www.aicpa.org/> or [ http://www.cpa2biz.com/](http://www.cpa2biz.com/) and entered into the ERP and CRM system is viewable by the AICPA and CPA2Biz. 

######  3\. SCOPE OF POLICY

This Privacy Policy governs the privacy practices used by the Organizations on their Web sites (referred to herein after as the Sites and listed at the end of this policy) as well as their offline data collection, use, and disclosure activities. The Organizations maintain high standards for the protection and privacy of users of their Sites as well as for those that have offline interactions with the Organizations.

We may disclose personally identifiable information about you to third parties as follows: 

1. Without asking for explicit consent from you:

CPA2Biz does this to better understand and serve users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.
> 
> b. If you are a member of the AICPA, CPA2Biz shares all the information collected about you, either as a result of your use of the Site or otherwise, with the AICPA and SSLLC.  CPA2Biz will not disclose this information to any third parties unless the third party enters into a confidentiality agreement with CPA2Biz. CPA2Biz requires the AICPA not to disclose this information to any third parties without CPA2Biz's consent, unless:
>
>> (i) The AICPA does not disclose any individually identifiable purchase information or any personally      identifying information about the member;
>> 
>> (ii) The third party enters into a confidentiality agreement with the AICPA; or
>> 
>> (iii) The AICPA assumes responsibility for operation of the Site from CPA2Biz and disclosure is required in       order to operate the Site. 
> 
> c. If you are not a member of the AICPA, CPA2Biz will share with the AICPA and SSLLC all the information we collect in connection with the sale to you of any product sold on the portion of this Site targeted to CPAs. In addition, CPA2Biz will transmit your User ID to the AICPA so, in the future, if you elect to become a member of the AICPA, your User ID on the CPA2Biz Site will be available to you for use as a User ID on the AICPA Web site. CPA2Biz requires the AICPA not to disclose this information to any third parties without CPA2Biz's consent, unless:
>
>> (i) The third party enters into a confidentiality agreement with the AICPA; or
>> 
>> (ii) The AICPA assumes responsibility for operation of the Site from CPA2Biz and disclosure is required in      order to operate the Site.
> 
> d. CPA2Biz and the AICPA share Email and Web site usage information about visitors to the Site who have received a targeted e-mail promotional campaign from us with a third-party advertising company, Epsilon Interactive, for the sole purpose of targeting future e-mail campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, CPA2Biz and Epsilon Interactive track some of the pages you visit on our Web site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). This information is not shared with any third parties other than Epsilon Interactive.
> 
> e. CPA2Biz allows third parties to provide Site features and services. These third parties are prohibited from using personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.
> 
> f. Our contractors, consultants, and professional advisers provide a service to us. For example, from time to time CPA2Biz may use third parties to help us collect information about our users. In those cases, CPA2Biz would prohibit the third parties from using the information they collect for any purpose other than providing the service to us 
> 
> g. CPA2Biz will disclose personally identifiable information as we believe necessary to comply with the law and protect the rights, property, or safety of others

2. With your consent:

> a. To facilitate a transaction or communication with a third party that you initiate. For example, we will provide your information, including credit card information, to the third parties from whom you purchase services through this Site. Those parties' use of your information is subject to their privacy practices and agreement with you. 
> 
> b. When it is inherent in the function you use on the Site, such as posting to a discussion area where your e-mail address automatically appears. 

3. Supplementing of Information: 

To provide better service to you on the Site, we may conclude it is necessary for us to supplement the information you provide us with information from third-party sources, which would require disclosure of your personally identifiable information to such third parties. 

For Example:

> a. If, when you register, you tell us that you are an AICPA member, we will verify that fact with membership information provided to us by the AICPA. 
> 
> b. We may, from time to time, purchase third-party marketing data and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers we think our users would be interested in. We might use this information to enhance or overlay the "profile" of individual users, linking the supplemental information with your personally identifiable information. 

AICPA members should understand that CPA2Biz acts as the AICPA's agent in a number of capacities that are governed by these privacy practices. For example, CPA2Biz may act as the AICPA's agent in the rental of certain member information to third parties. The rental is governed by the AICPA's privacy procedures, if different from those of CPA2Biz. Similarly, CPA2Biz may transmit to certain affinity partners of the AICPA certain information provided to it by the AICPA which may overlap with personal information you have also provided to CPA2Biz directly. This information would be shared with affinity partners of the AICPA so they can provide you with special offers. The transmission of this data to the affinity partners is subject to the AICPA's privacy practices as well. 

The AICPA is able to view all the information collected about you in connection with the sale to you of any product sold on the portion of this Site targeted to CPAs. This includes transmission of your User ID to the AICPA so, in the future, if you elect to become a member of the AICPA, your User ID on the CPA2Biz Site will be available to you for use as a User ID on the AICPA Web site. 

We do not currently sell e-mail addresses to any third party. Consistent with the AICPA's historical practice, we do rent mailing address lists for one-time use per list purchase only to companies and organizations that offer products or services of interest to CPAs, other accountants, and business and financial executives. The products or services offered in the mail campaign must be relevant to a business environment.

CPA2Biz shares information it collects, either as a result of your use of the Site or otherwise, with the AICPA. 

######  7\. SECURITY

The Organizations are committed to maintaining the security of information under our control. To safeguard and secure the information we collect, we have put in place appropriate physical and logical security procedures, encryption, and controls; however, this should not be construed as a guarantee of absolute security.

Our staff is trained to treat information with the utmost confidentiality. Internally, we restrict access to personal information to employees and contractors and agents who need access to the information to do their jobs or perform services on behalf of the AICPA, CPA2Biz, and SSLLC. These employees and contractors are committed to our privacy and security policies. Should you believe there has been a breach in our Privacy Policy or the security of our Sites, please contact us at the appropriate telephone number, e-mail address, or mailing address listed below.

######  11\. LISTING OF SITES GOVERNED BY THIS POLICY

<http://www.aicpa.org/> and its Centers   
<http://www.aicpastore.com/>   
<http://www.360financialliteracy.org/>   
<http://www.aicpalearning.org/>

1CPA2Biz offers client-focused business solutions programs (for example, payroll and banking) that enable CPAs to build stronger relationships with their business clients or employers. 

2This site is commonly known as the AICPA Store and is a professional resource for over 200,000 CPAs and financial professionals. On June 11, 2001, CPA2Biz, Inc. (CPA2Biz) began performing the electronic commerce activities related to online product sales for the AICPA. Accordingly, all AICPA member and other database information was initially transferred to <http://www.cpa2biz.com/> at that time. This AICPA database information is continually updated to CPA2Biz through ongoing transfers. 

3Individual state societies are not party to this Privacy Policy and the reader should look to his or her state society for guidance on what is done with information provided at a state level. 

4Users become authorized after entering the correct User Name and Password. We recommend that you do not divulge your Password to anyone. We will never ask you for your Password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Also remember to sign out of the Site you are using and close your browser window when you have finished your use of the Site(s). This is to ensure that others cannot access your confidential personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a public library or Internet cafe. 

5For those areas, the AICPA may disseminate the user name and password to the members of these user groups; no online registration is required. Other AICPA Web destinations may offer premium content and services only to members of a particular program. Access to this premium content may require online registration and enrollment in the program. For many AICPA Sites and the CPA2Biz Site, to access restricted content, the registered user must have the appropriate user profile for access to that information. For example, to access restricted Tax Section content, the registered user profile must indicate that he or she has paid for a Tax Section membership. 

6The Sites may from time to time work with certain third parties to provide our users with services that use cookies. For example, CPA2Biz currently works with a Web-based survey service provider, Zoomerang that uses cookies to recognize returning users and to monitor traffic through its site. If you do not want to save site-related cookies on your hard drive, you can adjust your browser settings to delete and/or not accept cookies. However, if you adjust your browser in this manner, we cannot guarantee that all applications on the Sites will function properly for you. 

7Although the actual activation of the opt-out will happen sooner, there may be distributions already in process that may still be received by you within that 10-day period. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving the types of communications described above, we may still from time to time communicate with you about your account, membership, or operation of our Sites, or as part of a transaction or activity in which you have elected to participate. For example, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send users an e-mail. You cannot opt out of receiving these communications. 

8For the AICPA to maintain its role as the national organization for CPAs, an independent certification body that follows the international fundamentals and principles of ISO9001:2000 is used to annually review the organization in its quest to consistently meet and/or exceed our member/customer requirements and expectations in quality, performance, timeliness, and in the cost of products and services we provide. The AICPA Quality System ensures that as the AICPA engages with both internal and external parties privacy is adhered to as an extremely important part of our quality objective. The AICPA is currently certified in _ISO9001:2000 Quality Management Systems- Requirements_.
