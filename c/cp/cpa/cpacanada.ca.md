# Privacy Policy

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about the types of Personal Information the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada, or its agents, (as follows, "CPA Canada", "we" or "us") collects about you in the process of conducting the principal activities of CPA Canada and to provide you with general membership benefits as well as providing you with specific products and services you have contracted from us. It explains how we use and disclose that information, the choices you have regarding such use and disclosure, and how you may correct that information. The majority of the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by CPA Canada is for the purposes of membership, and therefore for non-commercial purposes.

This Privacy Policy sets out a summary of the principles and procedures that CPA Canada follows in meeting its privacy commitments and, as applicable in light of the foregoing, complying with the requirements of the laws and regulations under applicable privacy laws in Canada, including the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. From time to time, we may make changes to this Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy is current as of the "last revised" date which appears at the bottom of this page. We will treat Personal Information in a manner consistent with the Privacy Policy under which it was collected unless we have your consent to treat it differently. This Privacy Policy applies to any information we collect or receive about you, from any source.

## Principle #1 — CPA Canada is accountable for your personal information in its possession or control. 

CPA Canada is accountable for all personal information in its possession or control. This includes any personal information that CPA Canada has collected about members, students, candidates, customers, and past members (each, a “CPA Canada Stakeholder”), as either collected directly from such CPA Canada Stakeholder; from provincial CPA bodies; national and provincial CA, CMA, and CGA bodies which participated in unification; “CPA Canada Website”(s) including but not limited to CPAstore, Knotia, CPASource, DirectorsSource, CPAPracticeLink, Webtrust, CATrainingOffice, D2L, Caribbean.cpacanada.ca, InDepth Tax Course; or other organizations (e.g., corporations, government entities, not-for-profit organizations, academic institutions). However, from time to time CPA Canada may collect, use and disclose personal information as the agent of provincial CPA bodies, national and provincial CA, CMA, and CGA bodies which participated in unification, and other organizations, in which case, without limiting the obligations of CPA Canada to comply with applicable privacy laws, such other principal entities shall be accountable for such personal information.

CPA Canada has:

  * established and put into effect policies and procedures aimed at properly protecting personal information;
  * educated its staff and volunteers regarding such policies and procedures and their roles and responsibilities in protecting personal information; and
  * appointed a Chief Privacy Officer to oversee privacy issues at CPA Canada



## Principle #2 — CPA Canada identifies the purposes for which it collects personal information from you before it is collected. 

We generally identify the purposes for which we use your Personal Information at the time we collect such information from you and obtain your consent, in any case, prior to such use.

Some of the primary purposes for which we collect and use your Personal Information include:

  * to provide services to you in your capacity as a CPA Canada Stakeholder;
  * to regulate international students/candidates;
  * to complete a transaction with you when you purchase or use a product or service offered by us;
  * to advise you of CPA Canada products or services that may be of interest to you;
  * to send you electronic CPA Canada newsletters that may be of interest to you or to which you have subscribed, and to better understand which articles are of interest to you;
  * to conduct research and analytics for purposes that include but are not limited to better understanding CPA Canada Stakeholders, allowing CPA Canada Stakeholders to provide feedback on products and services, and producing data analytics and statistical reports;
  * to present non- CPA Canada content and advertising that is customized to your interests;
  * to respond to inquiries you submit;
  * to establish and manage your CPA Canada Website account(s);
  * to customize the content presented to you when using a CPA Canada Website;
  * to utilize certain CPA Canada Website services, and
  * to report usage of a CPA Canada Website – the reports may be used by CPA Canada, Ernst &Young Electronic Publishing, and individual(s) designated as group administrator(s).



We may also use your Personal Information as otherwise permitted or required by law.

## Principle #3 — CPA Canada obtains your consent before collecting personal information from you.

We explain your options and obtain your implicit or explicit consent at the time of or prior to collecting, using or disclosing your Personal Information. We will always collect your Personal Information by fair and lawful means (for example, when you complete an application form or purchase a product or service from us). We may collect Personal Information about you from third parties, such as provincial CPA bodies, national and provincial CA, CMA and CGA bodies, which participated in unification, CPA Canada Website(s), and other institutions and organizations. We also collect your Personal Information where we have obtained your consent to do so or as otherwise permitted or required by law.

Where is it reasonable to do so, or permitted by law, we may rely on implied consent. 

Except as required to process a transaction, to maintain records of CPA Canada or as required or permitted by applicable law, providing us with your personal information is voluntary. You may withdraw or modify your consent at any time, subject to legal and contractual restrictions, provided that reasonable notice is given to us. If you withdraw your consent to receive information regarding certain products, publications, services or events being offered by us, you may not be made aware of same. Refusal or withdrawal of consent from use of personal information by CPA Canada Website(s) may result in our being unable to provide you with CPA Canada Website services.

From time to time, CPA Canada Website site and service updates are emailed to users. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, you may request to be removed from this electronic mailing list at any time by contacting our Chief Privacy Officer (see contact information under Principle #8). You should understand, however, that if you are removed from the mailing list you may not be made aware of the status or availability of certain CPA Canada Website services.

International students/candidates are required to receive notifications related to their course enrollment and may not withdraw consent to receipt of these notifications. 

Personal Information is any information that is identifiable to you. This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, mailing address, phone numbers, email address, identification numbers, credit card numbers, banking information, and creditor information. Personal Information, however, generally does not include information that CPA Canada collects, uses or discloses solely for the purpose of communicating or facilitating communication with an individual in relation to their employment, business or profession such as the individual’s name, position name or title, work address, work telephone number, work fax number or work electronic address. 

## Principle #4 — CPA Canada discloses your personal information only for purposes for which it has consent, or as permitted or required by law. CPA Canada retains personal information only as long as necessary to fulfil those purposes.

We identify to whom, and for what purposes, we disclose your Personal Information, at the time of or prior to collecting such information from you and obtain your consent to such disclosure. For example, we may: 

  1. transfer/disclose your Personal Information, in the case of CPA Canada Stakeholders, to provincial CPA bodies, national and provincial CA, CMA and CGA bodies which participated in unification for the purposes of providing services to such CPA Canada Stakeholders;
  2. transfer your Personal Information to our volunteers, for the purposes of the volunteers performing volunteer functions;
  3. transfer your Personal Information to third party service providers with whom we have a contracted agreement that includes appropriate privacy standards, such as service providers that provide communication services support or data storage or processing – for the purpose of, for example, providing member benefits, facilitating commercial transactions with us or offering educational programming;
  4. on CPA Canada Website(s), to your organization via usage reports accessible by the individual(s) designation by your organization as its group administrator(s);
  5. disclose your Personal Information to such persons and for such purposes for which you provide your consent; and
  6. disclose your Personal Information as otherwise permitted or required by law.



We may keep a record of your Personal Information, correspondence or comments in a file specific to you. We will utilize, disclose or retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected and as permitted or required by law. 

From time to time we may disclose or hold your Personal Information outside of Canada, and while outside of Canada it may be subject to access by regulators in accordance with the laws of those jurisdictions. 

## Principle #5 — CPA Canada endeavours to keep accurate, complete, and up-to-date, personal information in its possession or control, to the extent required to meet the purposes for which it was collected. 

We will ensure that your Personal Information is kept as accurate, complete and up-to-date as possible based on information provided to us by you or any provincial CPA body, or any national or provincial CA, CMA or CGA body which participated in unification to which you belong or have belonged. We expect you, from time to time, to supply us with written updates to your Personal Information, if applicable. In the case of CPA Canada Stakeholders, Personal Information may be updated by accessing profiles created on a related CPA Canada Website.

## Principle #6 — CPA Canada protects the privacy of personal information in its possession or control by using security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. 

We have implemented physical, organizational, contractual and technological security measures to protect your Personal Information from loss or theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. The only employees who are granted access to your Personal Information are those with a business 'need-to-know' or whose duties reasonably require such information.

This helps us better understand our CPA Canada Website(s) traffic, visitor behavior and the impact of campaigns, content and email-driven traffic.
