Keeping you informed of our information gathering practices and our policy for how we use that information is important to us at Cprogramming.com. Below, you can find the ways in which we gather data and the ways that we use that data. 

##  Information Collection

### Log files

The server stores your host, your operating system, your browser, and referring page in the server's log file when you access Cprogramming.com. This information is stored, by default, by most websites. We do not use this information to track individual users, except to investigate extreme cases of abuse (such as hacking attempts); these log files are analyzed by statistical packages to determine trends in visitor patterns, such as which pages are most popular and which referrers send the most visitors. Your host name is used only to determine statistics about the site's percentages of traffic from various countries. 

### Message Board

You are asked but not required to register when you use the message board. You are not required to give your personal information when signing up and creating a profile. We do not use the information in visitor profiles for any purpose. When creating a profile, you are required to provide your date of birth. This information is used to comply with US federal law, which requires us to obtain parental permission before allowing children under 13 to create an account. Your birth date information is not used for any other purpose. The message board also tracks IP addresses of visitors. We do not use this information to track individuals, except in cases of visitors spamming the message board. If you register to use the message board, you will be asked for an email address; we do not, and do not intend to, sell your email address to spam houses. 

### BURST!Media
