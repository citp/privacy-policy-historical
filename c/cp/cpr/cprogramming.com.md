##  Information Collection

### IP data

When you visit the site, your IP address, along with other non-identifying information such as your web browser, is collected. Your IP address does not allow us to identify you. Your IP address is sent to Google Analytics which then further anonymizes this IP data by deleting the last three digits, does not retain the original copy, and uses the anonymized data to determine trends in visitor patterns, such as which pages are most popular and which referrers send the most visitors. This information processed by Google Analytics is used in aggregate to determine statistics about the site's traffic, which we use for purposes such as estimating advertising inventory and learning what content on the site is most popular. For more information on data gathering and usage by Google Analytics, see the "Cookies" section below. 

When you visit the site, your IP address, along with other non-identifying information, is retained by us for no more than three months. Your IP address may be used by us to provide content, such as region-targeted advertisements, that is relevant to your region. We may also use it for other legitimate interests such as investigating hacking attempts on the site. 

Your IP address may also be provided to a CDN provider such as Stackpath. The CDN provider uses your IP address to determine how to best serve content on the site to you so that it will load quickly. This information is retained by Stackpath for no more than 7 days. 

### Message Board

You must create a profile in order to post on the message board. When creating a profile, you are required to provide your date of birth. This information is used to comply with laws that require us to obtain parental permission before allowing children to create an account.

The message board also logs IP addresses of logged-in members. We use this information only to block users who have been spamming or otherwise engaged in abusive behavior on the message board. If you register to use the message board, you will be asked for an email address; your email address will be used to verify your identity (e.g. if you forget your password) and to inform you of information about your message board account, such as (optionally) notifications of new messages or responses to posts you've made. We retain and process this information on the basis of legitimate interests in helping you retain access to the board and avoid abuse. We may also use your email address collected in this way to comply with legal obligations, such as to inform you of a data breach. You may also opt-in to various notifications from the message board. You may easily opt out at any time by logging into the board and changing your preferences under the "Settings" option. 

Information associated with your message board account is retained until you choose to delete your account, since this information must be retained for your account to work properly and for us to protect the message board community from abuse. We may also delete information regarding accounts that have been inactive for an extended period of time. To delete your message board account, see the "information removal" section below.

Google Analytics does show us the browsing behavior on Cprogramming.com by individual clients (i.e., web browsers) used to visit the site, reported in an anonymous way so that we can't tie that behavior back to any specific person; this data is also paired with general, non-identifying information such as what kind of web browser was being used and what country the user was are visiting from, as determined by IP address.

We don't use this information about individual browsing patterns to profile individual users; we only use it to generate aggregated reports that let us understand how people use the site in general. We collect this information because we have a legitimate interest in knowing how visitors use the site, so we can make it better, and so we can let potential advertisers know how many visitors we get and from which region. We don't use Google Analytics to collect any information that would involve Google Analytics tracking or analyzing the behavior of visitors to Cprogramming.com on other websites. We also don't collect any information that would allow the tracking the behavior of a single individual person across multiple clients or devices. If you'd like to prevent Google Analytics from serving you cookies, you can use the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). 

We also share Google Analytics data with our advertising partners such as Google AdSense and BuySell ads. We do this so they can know how many people visit the site and from where, in order to help potential advertisers decide whether to buy ads on Cprogramming.com. We also do this to help us understand which pages on the site generate more or less revenue relative to the number of visits they get, to help make decisions about what articles to feature or to write. This data is not used to target specific ads at any vistors based on their behavior or based on anything about them except which broad geographic region (e.g. country) they are visiting from, as determined by their IP address.
