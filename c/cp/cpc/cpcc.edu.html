        <p>This document describes Central Piedmont Community College's (hereafter referred to as
        CPCC) policy regarding information received about you during visits to our web site. The
        amount and type of information received depends on how you use the site. </p>
        <p>Limitation on Scope of Content:<br>
        <br>
        The CPCC web site contains information regarding CPCC and its education and training
        services. All pricing information referred to in this site is in U.S. dollars. </p>
        <p>No Representation or Warranty:<br>
        <br>
        CPCC reserves the right to modify the information contained in this site at any time
        without notice. While CPCC makes all reasonable efforts to insure that all material on
        this site is correct, accuracy cannot be guaranteed and CPCC does not assume any
        responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or authenticity of any information contained
        in this site. <br>
        This site and all information and materials contained herein, is provided to you "as
        is" without warranty of any kind. This site may contain hypertext links to other
        World Wide Web sites which are completely independent of this site. CPCC makes no
        representation or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or authenticity of the
        information contained in any such hypertext link, and any hypertext link to another person
        or entity shall not in any manner be construed as endorsement by CPCC of such person's or

        Your confidential use of this site cannot be guaranteed by CPCC. CPCC shall not be

        <p>Normal Web Site Usage:<br>
        <br>
        You can visit CPCC's web site to access education/training service information or use our
        online tools (online courses, etc.) without telling us who you are and without revealing
        any personal information. The only information we collect and store during normal web site
        usage is the web site that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time
        of those requests. <br>
        We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the
        usefulness of customer visits. During normal web site usage, we do not collect or store
        personally identifiable information such as name, mailing address, email address, phone
        number or social security. </p>
        <p>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information:<br>
        <br>
        There are instances where CPCC requests personally identifiable information to provide the
        web site visitor a service or correspondence (mailed class schedules and brochures). This
        information, such as name, mailing address, email address, type of request and possibly
        additional information, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of
        the data by CPCC and is used to fulfill your request. CPCC makes every effort to insure
        the secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information using industry
        accepted data collection and encryption methodologies such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
        and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). The information you provide is used by CPCC to improve the
        services we provide you. It is never provided to any other company for that company's
        independent use. </p>
        <p>Use of Cookies:<br>
        <br>
        Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual's hard drive
        for record-keeping purposes so that we may track site and user activity. The use of
        cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at most major web sites. By showing
