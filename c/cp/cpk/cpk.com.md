Last Updated: April 2010

## Our Privacy Commitment To Registered Users

California Pizza Kitchen, Inc. ("CPK") is committed to treating the personal and corporate information of our users with respect and sensitivity. Our privacy commitment is described in this Privacy Policy. As our services evolve and we perceive the need or desirability of using information collected in other ways, we may from time to time amend this Privacy Policy. We post the effective date of our Privacy Policy on our website ("Site"). We encourage you to check our Site frequently to see the current Privacy Policy and Terms of Use in effect and any changes that may have been made to them. If we make material changes to this Policy we will post the revised Policy and the revised effective date on this Site. Please check back here periodically or contact us at the address listed at the end of this Policy.

This Policy is part of our Terms of Use Agreement. Please [click here](https://web.archive.org/terms/) to see that Agreement.

## General Information

1\. We believe that you have the right to understand how your information is stored and used. We require that sites linked to our Site contain a notice identifying their privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third parties or the content of linked sites, although we do encourage you to read the applicable privacy policies and terms and conditions of such parties or web sites. By using the Site, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## Information You Provide Us

In general, you can visit CPK.com without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. If you choose to register, and are 16 years of age or older, we will collect your name, date of birth, email address, and street address along with other information you may choose to submit, and you will choose a password as part of the registration process ("Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII"). If you make a purchase on our Site we will also ask you for additional information including the credit card number and expiration date, billing address, shipping address, name on the account and telephone numbers for the billing and shipping addresses ("Credit Card Information").

For your security we do not keep or store your Credit Card Information after your purchase transaction is completed. We only share your Credit Card Information as necessary to complete your purchase transaction as disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

By providing your PII to us, you explicitly agree to our collection and use of such information as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Protecting Children's Privacy

We recognize that some of the users of our site may be under the age of 16 ("Minors"). We are committed to protecting Minors' privacy online and meeting the requirements of the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. While we offer programs, such as the CPKids Birthday Club, which are intended to appeal to Minors, only a parent or guardian may register a Minor in the program. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information from Minors.

Although users under 16 years of age may be allowed to participate in some contests and promotions, if such a user wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parent or guardian identified in the initial registration process. We do not publish names, ages, or images for contest winners under 16 without first receiving parental or guardian consent.

If you have knowledge that a child under the age of 16 has submitted Personally Identifiable Information to us or if parents or guardians want to review, change or delete their child's registration information, simply contact us [via email](mailto:comments@cpk.com) or by clicking on the link on the registration page or by writing us at the address below. Parents can also telephone us at 310-342-5000 but before any information is disclosed the parent will be required to provide the parent's name and email address for verification. We will only send the information to the parent email address in the registration file.

If a Minor who is not registered on our Site contacts CPK through an email, we will respond to that email on a one-time basis without obtaining parental consent and we will then delete the email address. We will not use that email address to contact the Minor thereafter. Our Site does not provide email services, chat rooms or message boards.

## Cookies

A cookie is a text file that our Site transfers to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes and to enhance the quality of your visit to our Site. The cookie assigns a random, unique number to your computer. It does not contain information which would personally identify you, although we can associate the cookie with any personal identifying information that you provide us while visiting our Site.

If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you have the option to regulate the use of cookies through your Internet browser settings or other commercially available software. Doing so, however, may make some of our sites' features unavailable to you.

## Use of Information

The use of your information is subject to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use in effect at the time of use. The provisions contained herein supersede all previous notices or statements regarding our privacy practices with respect to this Site.

We sometimes use aggregated data (independent of any personal identifiers) for research and commercial purposes. This information includes what areas our users visit most frequently and what services they access most often. This information helps us develop a better site that is more useful and accessible to you.

We may use your PII internally, among other things, to offer our own or third-party products and services that we think you may find of interest, but only CPK, its subsidiaries and contractors involved in distributing the offers or providing the products or services will have access to your PII. Our subsidiaries and contractors will be required to use any PII we provide them only for that intended purpose.

We may use your email address to contact you to respond to your inquiries or to provide information on products or services to you. You can elect not to receive emails from us either by so indicating at the time you register, "unsubscribing" to an email you receive or by contacting us as indicated below.

We reveal Personally Identifiable Information about you to unaffiliated third parties if: (1) you request or authorize it; (2) the information is provided to help complete a transaction for you; (3) the information is provided as we may in our sole discretion determine is necessary or reasonably required to comply with the law, applicable regulations, court orders or subpoenas, to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements, or to protect our rights, property or safety or the rights, property or safety of our users or others (e.g., to a consumer reporting agency for fraud protection etc.); (4) the disclosure is done as part of a purchase, transfer or sale of services or assets (e.g., in the event that substantially all of our assets are acquired by another party, customer information may be one of the transferred assets); (5) the information is provided to our agents, outside vendors or service providers to perform functions on our behalf (e.g., analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing customer service, processing orders, etc.); or (6) to others as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Opt-Out, Access, and Security

If you do not wish to receive offers or other notices from us in the future, you can "opt out" by contacting us at the address indicated at the end of this policy. In addition, if you provide us with PII, you will always have the option of requesting that the PII be removed from our system by contacting us at the address indicated at the end of this policy.

To review your PII, make any changes or corrections or to request that we remove your information please contact us at the address listed below. We will try to complete your request as promptly as possible. Any changes will affect only future uses of your PII.

We use industry-standard, established security measures in place in our physical facilities and in our computer systems, databases, and communications networks that are designed reasonably to protect information contained within our systems from loss, misuse or alteration. However, no transmission of information is guaranteed to be completely secure. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise data security. You acknowledge and agree to assume this risk when communicating with us.

## Corporate Information

We also protect your corporate information from use in ways that are intended to annoy or harass. We will not disclose any information that you provide us regarding your company as part of your registration except with your express consent or where necessary to provide you with a requested service. Our Terms of Use Agreement does not permit users of our Site to copy or use your corporate information to send you unsolicited communications or in other similarly improper ways.

However, we are not responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any non-public information that you provide us. If there is information that you wish to protect from disclosure to others, do not provide it to us.
