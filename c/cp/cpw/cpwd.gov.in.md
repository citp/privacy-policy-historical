# Private Policy | Central Public Works Department, Government of India

CPWD considers the responsible use of personal information to be a critical element in enabling the Internet to reach its potential as a serious tool for personal and professional activities. As the Internet changes our lives in a number of ways, CPWD is committed to respecting your privacy. CPWD has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm's commitment to privacy. 

In general, you can visit www.cpwd.gov.in without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and / or to administer our Web site. This gives us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous. 

There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name, home or business address and e-mail address. CPWD will seek to let you know before we collect any personal information from you over the Internet. When CPWD receives information about your session or about you, we may use it for research or to improve our site and the services we offer you. We will ask you if you want us to use that information to continue contact with you by CPWD and our business partners via e-mail or other means -- for example, to send you new product information or notification of special offers. If you do not want us or our partners to contact you, you can choose to "opt out," and CPWD will endeavor to respect your wishes. 

This site contains links to other sites. CPWD is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
