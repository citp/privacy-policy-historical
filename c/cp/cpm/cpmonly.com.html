										<h2>CPMonly Privacy policy</h2>
<p>CPMonly for over 4 years has been delivering high quality results and unmatched customer service for both website publishers and advertisers. Through the years we have developed from a small group of niche sites to having relationships with 250+ site owners. We pride ourselves in lending value to our customers through efficient service, hard work, and the ability to achieve goals. It is critical to CPMonly that consumers’ privacy, rights and choices are maintained during this entire process of finding and delivering ads to consumers.</p>
<p>This document is intended to inform consumers how CPMonly collects, maintains and processes information we collect in the delivery of our network advertising services.</p>
<p><strong>What types of data does CPMonly collect?</strong><br>
Inside the CPMonly network, we collect non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) such as web sites visited, content viewed, ad interaction, interaction with advertiser websites, IP addresses, search terms used, and other click and browsing behavior. Additionally, we may collect non-PII technical information including IP address, OS, browser type, language settings.</p>
<p><strong>How does CPMonly track consumer behavior?</strong><br>
Cookies are small packets of data stored on your computer that allow sites to recognize the computer when you revisit the site. Generally, sites use this cookie to provide services such as auto login, information delivery, and to better understand how you are interacting with the site. These cookies enable sites to customize the site to your needs and interests, so that they can be as valuable and relevant to you as possible.</p>
<p>Like many websites, CPMonly sets a cookie on your computer containing an anonymous identifier. This cookie allows CPMonly to better target and analyze consumer behavior with the goal of providing better and more relevant advertising.</p>
<p>You are always free to decline cookies, but by doing so you may not be able to use certain features on the websites or take full advantage of all the website offerings and targeted advertising.

Please note that if you buy a new computer, upgrade or change Web browsers or delete this “opt out” cookie, you will need to perform this process again.</p>
<p><strong>How does CPMonly use this information?</strong><br>
CPMonly licenses the Appnexus ad serving technology to create data segments on any consumer information to create anonymous consumer segments. For example, consumers that demonstrate car buying behaviors are grouped into an auto/car-buying segments. These segments will be used to target and optimize advertiser campaigns.</p>
<p>CPMonly will never use this information to identify, locate or contact consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Which data do we retain and for how long?</strong><br>
We maintain non-PII information on consumer behavior for 120 days. This data includes web sites visited, content viewed, ad interaction, interaction with advertiser websites, IP addresses, search terms used, and other click and browsing behavior. Additionally, we may collect non-PII technical information including IP address, OS, browser type, language settings.</p>
