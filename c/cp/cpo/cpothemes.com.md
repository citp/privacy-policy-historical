### **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

Our Declaration of Conformity can be found [here](http://cpothemes.com/GDPR.pdf).

GDPR’s main principle is that users own their personal data, and the companies have the obligation to make the right steps to facilitate the users’ rights:

  * to know what personal data companies collect, how they store this info and for how long
  * to know if the personal data is shared with third parties
  * to get the personal data (data portability)

#### **Terms used in this document: We, users, third parties.**

From the unlogged visitors of our website <https://cpothemes.com/> we use cookies for our affiliate system and traffic analysis information offered by services such as Google Analytics.

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection. An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: <https://automattic.com/privacy/>. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment. If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
