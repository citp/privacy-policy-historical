## U.S. – EU Privacy Shield and Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield

Crownpeak complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. Crownpeak has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Crownpeak commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Crownpeak at privacy@crownpeak.com or you may write to us at: Privacy Officer Crownpeak Technology 707 17th St., Floor 38 Denver, CO 80202 United States of America Crownpeak has further committed to refer unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.>

In compliance with the Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.

## Data security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Crownpeak uses secure sockets layer (SSL) for securing communications and transactions across the Internet. When you enter sensitive information (such as cloud login credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology. The SSL protocol uses digital certificates to create and secure confidential communications between the browser and our web server. Data transmitted over an SSL connection cannot be tampered with or forged without the two parties (you and Crownpeak) becoming immediately aware of the tampering. A key or padlock icon in the browser window identifies the security mode of most popular browsers. When the browser is running in “normal” mode, the key is broken or the padlock is open.

Once an SSL connection has been established, the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, indicating that the browser is now in “secure” mode. SSL is supported in the vast majority of browsers, which means that almost anyone with a browser can benefit from SSL encryption. Crownpeak uses certificates from well known providers of digital trust services that enable businesses and consumers to engage in commerce and communications with confidence. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at [privacy@crownpeak.com.](mailto:privacy@crownpeak.com "opens email client")

For data collected by websites hosted by Crownpeak on behalf of its customers, Crownpeak ensures that all applicable Privacy Shield Principles are applied to the data for as long as it is hosted by Crownpeak and under Crownpeak’s control.

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve and enable services we offer you, marketing, analytics, product functionality, and website functionality.

Service provider, sub-processors/onward transfer

Crownpeak may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this privacy policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Licensees. If we engage a third party to process your data on our behalf, that third party will also be bound by our privacy policy and authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

## Data retention

Crownpeak will retain the personal data we collect from you for as long as needed. To provide services to our customers or to support our own marketing programs as described above. Crownpeak will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
