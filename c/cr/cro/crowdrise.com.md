# Privacy Policy | Charity Online Fundraising on Crowdrise

#### 1\. Our Commitment to Privacy

CrowdRise, Inc. ("CrowdRise", "we", "us") is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. CrowdRise has developed this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to help make sure you understand what information we collect and what CrowdRise does with the information we collect. The Privacy Policy discloses the information we gather on [www.crowdrise.com](https://web.archive.org/) (the "Site"), as well as ways in which we process and, share such information and how you can correct or change such information. This Privacy Policy addresses our privacy practices relating to the general use of our Site by anyone who visits, browses or otherwise uses the Site, or who otherwise contacts us by mail, email, social media or telephone in connection with the services we offer (collectively, "you").

By visiting the Site, submitting information, making a donation or using any of our products or services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy and consent to having your data transferred to and/or processed in the United States. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.

#### 2\. The Information We Collect

CrowdRise is a crowd-funding platform for people and organizations to raise support for charitable causes. CrowdRise’s core principles are that people have unprecedented power to use the power of networks to leverage their personal capacity and that raising money for charity and giving back should be fun. The Site is intended to provide this great experience without requiring you to submit any more personal information than is reasonably necessary to use the Site effectively.

We collect the following categories of information from you:

##### 1\. Information Provided by Individuals

We may receive and store any information you enter on the Site or provide to us in any other way that would allow us to identify you personally or contact you. Examples of information we may collect from you include:

  * If you set up a personal account, we collect your name, email address and may ask you for your birthday and, if you choose, social information (from the social networking site you connected with), your sex, any photos that you upload to the Site, your mailing address and phone number;
  * Your email address and any personal information you provide to us when you email us, or [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/about/contact), or when you post on the Site;
  * Personal information you provide about yourself on your account page, a project page or anywhere else on the Site. For example, if you use any third-party platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter, to share information about yourself on the Site, we collect that information;
  * If you enter a sweepstakes, we collect your name, address and contact information to administer the sweepstakes and fulfill prizes and, to the extent permitted by law, to provide you with information on upcoming events, announcements, and sweepstakes.



If you do not want us to collect information about you, you can simply decide not to submit it to us, but then you may not be able to take advantage of all of the services and products offered on the Site.

##### 2\. Information Collected From Charities

If you are a charity or nonprofit (each a "Charity") and you establish an account with CrowdRise, we will collect the name, tax ID, physical address, email address, birthday and phone number of the person who establishes a Charity account and claims your Charity (the "Charity Contact") and any other information that is provided to us by GuideStar about your Charity. We also may collect, if the Charity Contact chooses to provide it, the Charity Contact’s sex, or any photos uploaded to the Site.

##### 3\. Passive Gathering of Information Electronically

###### 1\. Cookies

When you interact with the Site, we try to make that experience simple and meaningful. When you visit our Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer or mobile device (as the case may be). Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer or mobile device (as the case may be) when you visit a website or access or use a mobile application, and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the Site (as the case may be). A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web or application session and expire when you close your browser or exit the application. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Site and will last for longer.

Some of the cookies used by the Site are set by us, and some are set by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf.

Most web and mobile device browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/), which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browsers or mobile devices. Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies used on the Platform, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Site.

###### 2\. Web Beacons

A web beacon is a transparent image file. Web beacons enable CrowdRise to track website usage information, such as the number of times a given web page has been viewed. Web beacons are invisible to you and (unlike cookies) are not placed on your computer. We may use them in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with the pages and content on the pages of the Site.

We may also use Web beacons to track whether you have opened an HTML email. When the email is opened, a part of the code that makes up the HTML page calls a web server to load the web beacon that then generates a record showing that the email has been viewed. Web Beacons may also recognize when the email was opened, how many times it was forwarded and which URL’s (links within the email) were clicked.

###### 3\. Pixel Tags

In addition, we use "Pixel Tags" (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’ personally identifiable information.

###### 4\. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals

We do not currently respond to "do not track" signals or other mechanisms that might enable consumers to opt out of tracking on our Site.

###### 5\. Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and Services. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/).

###### 6\. E-mail Communications to You and Your Friends

When you send an email to CrowdRise, we may retain your email address and the contents of the email you send.

When you use the email share button, a service provided to us by Gigya, Inc., you are agreeing to the [Gigya Terms of Use](http://www.gigya.com/terms-of-service/) and [Privacy Policy](http://www.gigya.com/privacy-policy/).

###### 7\. Aggregated Information

From time to time, we may also ask you to provide us information that is not intended to allow us to identify you personally. This information may be aggregated and used for our internal purposes or for creating reports for third-party advertisers and partners, or otherwise shared with third parties for any lawful purpose, without your permission.

We also may automatically collect Site usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of users to the Site, pages visited and similar data. This data is used in the aggregate, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that is intended to identify you personally. Aggregate information generally is collected through the use of cookies and web beacons as discussed above. This aggregate information helps CrowdRise determine general usage patterns and modify the Site in order to improve your experience. This type of aggregate information may be shared with third parties at any time.

###### 8\. Information from Third Parties

It may be necessary, in rare cases, for us to obtain address or other information about you from third-party sources for fraud prevention or for legal compliance, to enforce our legal rights or to protect the rights of other users of the Site and our services.

#### 3\. How We Use Information

When you provide us with your personal information, we may use such information for a number of purposes, including:

When you make a donation or sign up to, volunteer, fundraise, enter a sweepstakes, or register for an event for a Charity or for an organization or event associated with fundraising (e.g., a marathon, walkathon, concert or similar), CrowdRise shares with the Fundraiser, Charity, Event Organizer, Sweepstakes Partners and Event Partners your name, address, email address, donation amount, date of transaction, transaction identification number and may also include the name of the project, and event associated with the donation.

To request removal of your personal information from these areas of the Site, contact us using the information below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. The profile you create on our site will be publicly visible.

#### 8\. Information you Provide to Facebook and Other Social Networking Sites

The Site allows users to access Facebook to interact with friends and to share on Facebook through Wall and friends’ News Feeds. We do this currently through a third-party service. That third-party service may store some of the information as part of their provision of services to us. If you do not use Facebook or another social networking site (SNS) to log in then that third-party does not receive any data. If you are already logged into the Site and Facebook or another SNS, when you click on "Connect with Facebook," or a similar connection on another SNS, you will be prompted to merge your profiles. If you are already logged into the Services but not logged into Facebook or another SNS that we support, when you click on "Connect with Facebook," or a similar connection on another SNS, you will be prompted to enter your SNS credentials or to "Sign Up" for the SNS. By proceeding, you are allowing the Site to access your information and you are agreeing to the Facebook or other SNS’s Terms of Use in your use of the Services. Conversely, if you are not currently registered as a user of the Site, and you click on "Sign in" using Facebook or another SNS that we support, you will first be asked to enter your Facebook or SNS credentials and then be given the option to register for the Site. In this case, we may receive information from Facebook or another SNS to make it easier for you to create an Account on the Site and show our relevant content from your Facebook or SNS friends. Once you register on the Site and connect with Facebook or another SNS you will be able to automatically post recent activity back to Facebook or the other SNS. Any information that we collect from your Facebook or other SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have with that SNS, so please consult the SNS’s privacy and data practices. Further, you can edit privacy settings for the reviews that appear on Facebook, or disconnect your Services activity stream by visiting the Facebook Applications Settings page.

#### 9\. Important Disclosures, Practices and Contact Information

##### 1\. Third-party Links

The Site may contain links to third-party websites. Please be aware that CrowdRise cannot control and is not responsible for the information collection practices of such websites, which may differ from those of CrowdRise.

This will help to ensure that others cannot access your personal information.

We want you to feel confident using the Site. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take commercially reasonable steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches or other communications always will remain secure. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your personal information, we will notify you if reasonably possible and as reasonably necessary so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may notify you under such circumstances using the email address(es) we have on record for you. You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your personal information.

We may change this Privacy Policy, and any of our policies and procedures concerning our practices for managing personal information, at any time and without prior notice subject to applicable law.
