## 2\. Information We Collect

## a. Information you provide to us

We may collect and process information you give us about you by filling in forms on any of the Sites or furnished by you through or on the Songkick Services, or by corresponding with us by phone, email or otherwise (such as your name, postal and e-mail address).

## b. Information collected by us when you use the Sites

When you visit and interact with the Sites or the Songkick Services, we and third parties we engage to provide analytical services to us (the **“Operational Service Providers”** ) may collect information about you and your behavior such as aggregated information, usage information (e.g., numbers and frequency of visitors to the Site and its components and user music preference data), demographic information, IP addresses and other information.

  * _Server Log Files_. Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit any of the Sites, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. Through the use of web logs or log files, we may also gather information such as date, time, browser type, navigation history, and IP addresses of all visitors to any of the Sites.

This could include your name, e-mail address, music activity and other information. If you are on another website and you agree to share your information with the Sites, that website will forward to us your information. You also may choose to participate in a third-party application or feature (such as one of our Facebook or Twitter applications or a similar application or feature on a third-party website) through which you allow us to collect and share (or the third-party to collect and share) information about you, including personal information. If you access the Sites through a third-party connection or log-in, we may also collect your user ID and/or user name associated with the third-party service, and any information you have made public in connection with that service or which the third-party shares with partner services.

We may share your information with a number of recipients:

  * _Disclosure to Artists_. One of the main reasons we operate the Sites is to promote closer and more meaningful interaction and engagement between you and Artists. As such, we may share your personal information with these Artists so that such Artists have relevant information about you to better understand their fan and consumer base.

We may also share your personal information with other Artists to contact you regarding products, programs, services and promotions that we and such Artist(s) believe may be of interest to you and for any other purpose set out in this Policy.

We may share your personal information with Operational Service Providers working under our instruction such as e-mail service providers or data centers or companies or people acting as agents of Songkick to perform tasks on our behalf. We will ensure that such Operational Service Providers and agents act on our instructions and that your information receives the same level of protection as if it was handled by us. Songkick’s agents do not have any right to use personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
  * _Disclosure to Business Partners_. From time to time, we may enter into co-branded, sponsorship, or other partnership ventures with third-party social media or business platforms, or otherwise join with other parties to provide specific services. In connection with each of these partnerships, we may share your information with such business partners to enable them to better target their services and marketing. The particular use of your information by such third parties is governed by their own privacy policies.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy, we may disclose your personal information when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency’s request, or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property.

## 8\. Other Important Notices Regarding Our Privacy Practices

## a. Third Parties We Work With

This Policy does not govern information you submit via Artist Websites save where submitted using the Songkick Platform. We are not responsible for any use of such data by Artists, regardless of whether it has been submitted through the Songkick Platform or not. The Sites may contain links to Artists or other third-party websites. These linked sites are not under our control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such linked site, or any link contained in any linked site. We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Sites does not imply endorsement of the linked site by Company or any of its affiliates, or any Artists.

If you provide any information through any such third-party website (other than via use of the Songkick Platform), your transaction will occur on such third-party’s website (and not the Sites) and the personal information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third-party. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties. You should be aware that if you should encounter an advertisement, link or reference to a third-party website on the Sites, even if we have a relationship with them, we do not control them, their websites or their policies and practices regarding use of their websites, transaction policies or any rules they have regarding the use of cookies or collection, use or disclosure of your personal information.

## b. Opting Out

We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected from you on the Sites for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the links below to the NAI “Consumer Opt-out,” DAA opt-out, and Google opt-out that are only applicable to participating third parties, which does not include the Company.

Please also note that following such “unsubscribe” instructions will opt you out of receiving marketing-related e-mail messages from the sender of the particular message from which you initiated the opt-out process, but will not opt you out of receiving such messages from other senders (including, as applicable, Company, the Artists or other third parties).

## Cookie Policy

The Sites use cookies to distinguish you from other users of the Sites. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse the Sites and also allows us to improve our site. By continuing to browse the site, you are agreeing to our use of cookies.

A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer if you agree. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive.

We use the following cookies:

  * Essential cookies - These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website, use a shopping cart or make use of e-billing services.
  * Analytical/performance cookies - They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the Sites when they are using them. This helps us to improve the way the Sites work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
  * Functionality cookies - These are used to recognize you when you return to the Sites. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences, for example, your choice of language or region.
  * Targeting cookies - These cookies record your visit to the Sites, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make the Sites and the advertising displayed on them more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.



We and our service providers may also use so-called “pixel tags,” also commonly known as “web beacons” or “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, **“Pixel Tags”** ) in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an electronic and often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than a single (1x1) pixel, that is placed on the Sites, though ordinarily not visible to the Sites’ visitors, and may be associated with cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Sites, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted e-mail messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has been opened.

If you want more information about the individual cookies, we recommend you to download a cookie management tool like Ghostery ([www.ghostery.com](https://www.ghostery.com/)) which allows you to understand and control the cookies set by a website.

Please note that third parties (including, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies

You block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of the Sites.

Except for essential cookies, all cookies we use will expire after three (3) months.
