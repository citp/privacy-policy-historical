		<h1>CrowdCompass Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>CrowdCompass, LLC ("CrowdCompass") respects individual privacy and values the confidence of its customers, shareholders, employees, vendors, users and business partners. Not only does CrowdCompass strive to collect, use, and disclose personally identifiable information (Personal Information) in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which it does business, but it also has a tradition of upholding the highest ethical standards in its business practices. </p>

		<p>CrowdCompass, as a subsidiary of Cvent, Inc. ("Cvent"), complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  Cvent has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Cvent's certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy principles that CrowdCompass follows with respect to collection, usage and transfer of Personal Information anywhere in the world, including transfers from the European Union (EU) to the United States. </p>

		<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE: PLEASE READ THROUGH THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING THE CONTENT AND SERVICES PROVIDED ON THE CROWDCOMPASS WEBSITE OR OTHERWISE USING THE WEBSITE, USERS CONSENT TO CROWDCOMPASS'S COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION RECEIVED BY CROWDCOMPASS (WHICH MAY INCLUDE PERSONAL INFORMATION) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY. USER'S MAY AT ANY TIME CHOOSE TO RESTRICT OR BLOCK THE SITE'S USE OF COOKIES IN THEIR WEB BROWSER. INFORMATION ABOUT THE USE OF COOKIES BY CROWDCOMPASS'S WEBSITE (AND USERS' CHOICE TO TURN OFF COOKIES) IS PROVIDED <a href="#cookies">HERE</a>.</p>

		<h4>Definitions</h4>

		<p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the following definitions shall apply: </p>

		<p>"Cvent" means Cvent, Inc. its predecessors, successors, subsidiaries, divisions and groups. </p>

		<p>"CrowdCompass" means Cvent d/b/a CrowdCompass.</p>

		<p>"Personal Information" means any set of information that identifies or could be used to identify an individual. Personal Information does not include information that is encoded or publicly available information not combined with private Personal Information. </p>

		<p>"User" means any user of CrowdCompass's web-based content management portal or mobile applications.</p>

		<h4>Our Service </h4>

		<p>CrowdCompass licenses a mobile application-based event management solution ("Mobile Event Solution") which is comprised principally of the web-based content management portal ("EventCenter") and a mobile application component (the "Software"). This solution may also be referenced in this Privacy Policy and other collateral as System, Tool, Product, Service, Solution, Application and other derivations thereof. CrowdCompass users are subject to the CrowdCompass Mobile Event Solution terms. </p>

		<h4>Notice </h4>

		<p>CrowdCompass will not disclose or share Personal Information collected on its web site with any third party, except as required by law and/or pursuant to a governmental request, or as necessary to provide services to support its software solutions. </p>

		<p>Aggregate Data. CrowdCompass may share reports with third parties based on aggregated data of its users ("Aggregated User Data"). Aggregated User Data does not include any Personal Information about users and is aggregated for the purposes of determining successful application benchmarks and other similar activities. </p>

		<p>Special Circumstances. CrowdCompass may disclose Personal Information when it has reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who is violating CrowdCompass's Terms of Use or may be causing injury to or interference with other CrowdCompass users or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.</p> 

		<p>IP Addresses. CrowdCompass may use user IP addresses to diagnose problems with CrowdCompass servers and to administer the CrowdCompass application. </p>

		<a name="cookies" id="#cookies"></a>
		<h4>Cookies </h4>

		<p>Definition. A cookie is a small data file placed in a user's web browser or written to a user's hard drive when a website is accessed.  A "session" cookie lasts for a single browser session only and is deleted when the user closes the web browser. A "persistent" cookie remains on the user's device (even while powered off) until it expires or is deleted. A persistent cookie will be reactivated when a user returns to the website which posted the cookie. Cookies cannot read or access other cookies or any data from a user's hard drive. Cookies alone will not personally identify a user, however a cookie may recognize a user's individual web browser or device through an IP Address, browser version, operating system and other information, and website users who log in to their CrowdCompass accounts may be individually identifiable to particular CrowdCompass applications using session cookies. </p>

		<p>Use. CrowdCompass uses cookies to improve user experience, monitor website usage and gather information which helps CrowdCompass improve the site content and applications. For example, cookies are used to distinguish between and authenticate users, save usernames and login status (so that users don't have to log in more than once each time they access secured portions of the site), keep track of user-specific settings such as language, layout and other preferences, and manage session information to minimize data entry and for general ease of use. Cookies are also used to "time-out" user sessions that are idle for an extended period of time. CrowdCompass may also use cookies to gather statistical and other information about how the website is used, assess the effectiveness of advertising, monitor access and use of particular content and provide tailored advertising and other content to users. Using cookies in the foregoing manner makes the website more effective, easier to use, improves security and efficiency, and is essential for the continuous improvement of CrowdCompass's systems. Consequently, accepting these cookies is necessary for many uses of the website and blocking or restricting cookies may limit a user's ability to access certain website content and functionality.</p>

		<p>Blocking/Restricting Cookies. Users may set their web browsers to restrict or to entirely block cookies, to configure cookie notification settings and/or to delete cookies already present on the browser or device.  Information on how to do this should be provided in the web browser's help/reference section. Users who block cookies may be able to access the CrowdCompass website but will not be able to use most of the content, applications and services CrowdCompass makes available on the website. Limiting or restricting certain types of cookies may prevent a user from using certain portions of the CrowdCompass website, depending on how the browser settings are configured. </p>

		<h4>Choice </h4>

		<p>CrowdCompass users may choose whether or not to submit Personal Information while using CrowdCompass's services. In some cases, choosing to withhold Personal Information, may limit a user's ability to use all of CrowdCompass's services. </p>

		<h4>Security </h4>

		<p>CrowdCompass has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information under its control. CrowdCompass protects secure data with industry-standard firewall and password protection systems. </p>

		<p>CrowdCompass periodically reviews and improves its security and privacy policies as necessary. Only pre-authorized individuals have access to CrowdCompass servers and information provided by its users. </p>

		<h4>Data Integrity </h4>

		<p>CrowdCompass will use Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that Personal Information is relevant accurate, complete and current, to its intended use. </p>

		<h4>Access and Correction </h4>

		<p>CrowdCompass users may change or modify previously submitted Personal Information by (i) using the EventCenter or (ii) sending an email request to <a href="mailto:customercare@cvent.com">customercare@cvent.com</a>. Please note that no data transmission over the Internet is infallible. Any information transmitted through the CrowdCompass application is done at the user's own risk. Once CrowdCompass receives the information, it will take every reasonable precaution to ensure its security. </p>

		<h4>Enforcement </h4>

		<p>CrowdCompass will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Privacy Policy and the US Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Principles. Any employee that CrowdCompass determines is in violation of this Privacy Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. </p>

		<h4>Web Site Links </h4>

		<p>The CrowdCompass website may contain links to other web sites. CrowdCompass is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these web sites. </p>

		<h4>Notification of Changes </h4>

		<p>As this Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time, please check back periodically to review any changes. The last modified date will be provided at the bottom of the page. </p>
