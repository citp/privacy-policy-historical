# Privacy Policy - CROSSMARK

The purpose of this Online Privacy Statement is to inform you about the types of information we gather online about you when you visit crossmark.com (“our Site”), how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, that information. This Online Privacy Statement may change from time to time, so please check back periodically. This Statement will explain the following regarding the treatment of data collected on our Site:

1\. Sites Covered By This Statement

2\. What Information We Collect  
The information we collect on our Site generally falls into the following two categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

_Personally Identifiable Information:_  
This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. The Personally Identifiable Information we collect when you use our Site may include your name, mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address. We request Personally Identifiable Information when you correspond with us, fill out any forms, or participate in any surveys. It will be clear when you are on a part of our Site that requires personal information, because we will ask you for it and you will have a choice about how we use that information.

_Non-Personally Identifiable Information:_  
This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. The non-personally identifiable data we collect when you visit our Site may include the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”)(1) of the Web site that you came from before visiting our Site, which pages you visit on our Site, which URL you next go to, which browser you used to come to our Site, your Internet Protocol (“IP”)(2) address, and any search terms entered on our Site.

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide customers with exceptional service and to provide all visitors a smooth, efficient, and personalized experience while using our Site. For example, if you request information on our Site, we use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide the requested information. We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information on an aggregated basis to analyze customer behavior to help us understand how visitors use our Site and to measure interest in the various pages. We use this information to improve the content of our Site and to make it easier to use.

5\. Sharing Your Information  
We DO NOT sell, trade, or rent to others the Personally Identifiable Information we collect online. Unless we have your permission, we will share the Personally Identifiable Information you provide online only with other crossmark.com entities and/or businesses that provide services to crossmark.com and only for the purposes described above. Where crossmark.com engages third parties to perform services on our behalf, we will require them to observe the intent of this Online Privacy Statement. On some pages we may offer you the opportunity to receive information from companies with products or services that may be of interest to you. If you choose to receive such information, crossmark.com may assist these companies in their marketing activities by forwarding their messages to you, but we will not provide these companies with any of your Personally Identifiable Information. From time to time, we may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information in response to a court order, subpoena, or government investigation. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may release certain Personally Identifiable Information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves. Our Site, crossmark.com, or its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another business entity or their respective assets could be acquired. Should such a combination or acquisition occur, you should expect that crossmark.com would share some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information to continue serving you and other users of our Site.

6\. Your Choices  
crossmark.com WILL NOT use or share the Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Site in ways unrelated to the purpose for which you provided the information, including those described above, without providing you a choice whether to permit any such unrelated uses.

1\. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. For example, [http://www.crossmark.com](http://www.crossmark.com/) is the URL for crossmark.com’s U.S. home page.

2\. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.
