    <h1>CrowdStar Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Last updated:  December 17, 2012</p>

    <p>CrowdStar, Inc. and its related entities (collectively "CrowdStar", "us", "our" or "we") is dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our users ("users" or "you"). This Privacy Policy describes the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information you provide in connection with our website at www.crowdstar.com (the "Site") or any CrowdStar game or application provided on other websites or other third party sources (collectively, the "Service"). Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is limited to information collected by CrowdStar through your use of the Service.</p>
    <p>By using the Service, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are responsible for periodically reading this Privacy Policy.  If you use our Service after we have updated this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge that you have read the updated terms and consent to our revised privacy practices. Use of the Service after changes are made to the Privacy Policy will be considered your consent to the new terms.</p>

    <h2>Information Collected and Used</h2>
    <p>CrowdStar's primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and enhance the Service and to enable users to easily navigate and enjoy the Service.  CrowdStar may use user information to analyze user behavior in CrowdStar’s games.  For example, CrowdStar may analyze user information to determine how often a user plays a particular game, if a user purchases premium goods and other similar events. </p>
    <p>When you use any of the CrowdStar games or applications, we may collect and record information through the social networking website you use to access the Service ("SN Website") or other third party source in accordance with the policies and terms of the SN Website or service provider.  We may share such information with the SN Website for its use as permitted by the terms of your agreement and privacy settings with the SN Website.  </p>
    <p>We may collect both Personal and Non-Personal Information.  Personal Information is defined as information about you that can be used to contact or identify you such as your name, email address, home address, and phone number. Personal Information does not include aggregate information, which is data we collect about the characteristics and activities of users of the Service, from which any Personal Information has been removed.  Non-Personal Information does not identify you personally and can include age, gender or interests.  We may combine Personal Information with Non-Personal Information and use this combination to improve your experience or to aggregate it with information collected from other users to improve or analyze our Service. This privacy policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information or of Non-Personal Information.</p>
    <p>The information we collect when you access the Service on an SN Website may include information that is visible on your social networking page such as: (1) your name, (2) SN Website user identification number and/or name, (3) locale, city, state and country, (4) sex, (5) birthdate, (6) time zone and (7) email address.  We may also collect your email address directly from you when you access our Service.  If you provide your email address in connection with a CrowdStar game, the email address will be retained by CrowdStar and we may use that email address to contact you about other CrowdStar games.  </p>
    <p>When you visit our Site or use the Service on an SN Website, your computer’s operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language and referring Web site addresses are logged automatically.  We also collect information about your usage and activity, such as number of clicks, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of this activity.  We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services. </p>
    <p>We may also acquire information from you through (1) your access and participation in message boards on the Service, (2) your email of a question to our customer support , (3) your purchase of a virtual product of any type, (4) your participation in surveys regarding the Service or (5) your participation in a sweepstakes or contest through the Service. Please note that because third parties manage the purchases of virtual goods offered by the Service, we do not have access to your credit card details and billing information. </p>
    <p>If you launch any of our games or applications on a mobile device, we also collect information regarding your device type, iOS advertising identifiers, HTML cookies, Open UDID, referral URL, operating system and version, IP address and unique device ID (UDID).  If you sign into the Service on your mobile device with Facebook Connect we will collect information that is visible via your Facebook account such as:  (1) your first and last name, (2) Facebook ID, (3) Profile Picture/URL, and (4) list of Facebook friends.  This information will be primarily used for social features.  </p>
    <p>If you provide your email address in connection with a Crowdstar game, the email address will be retained by Crowdstar and we may use that email address to contact you about your gaming experience.  We may also use part of your email address for friend-to-friend interaction.</p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk, generally to quickly identify a user's computer and to "remember" things about the user's visit, such as your preferences or a user name and password.  The Service sends cookies to your computer when you access or view content of a CrowdStar game. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your Personal Information for purposes such as improving the quality of our Service, tailoring recommendations to your interests, and making the Service easier to use.  You can disable cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use features of the Service.</p>

    <h2>Web Beacons</h2>
    <p>We may collect information using Web beacons.  Web beacons or "gifs", are electronic images that may be used on our Site or in our emails.  We use Web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.  </p>

    <h2>Information for Opting-Out of Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
    <p>You may click on the following link: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a> (or such other URL as may be specified by us from time to time) for information on how to opt-out of the use of cookies or Web beacons.</p>

    <h2>Advertisements</h2>
    <p>We may feature advertisements on our Service served by third parties.  These advertisers may collect and use information about your visits to our Service in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.  </p>
    <p>For example, we have contracted with certain companies to place tool bars and advertisements on our applications for cross-promotion purposes.   These companies may monitor our Service for the purpose of reporting traffic, statistics, advertisement "click-thrus," and/or other activities on our Service.  They use monitoring technologies to compile statistics about our Service visitors. </p>
    <p> You may see our games advertised in other applications.  After clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our game, you will become a user of the Service.   In order to prevent fraud and verify the installs, a unique device identifier may be shared with the advertiser.  </p>

    <h2>Disclosure of Your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>CrowdStar does not share your Personal Information except as approved by you or as described below:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>With your consent, for example, when you agree to our sharing your information with other third parties for their own marketing purposes subject to their separate privacy policies;</li>
        <li>Agents and Service Providers: CrowdStar may engage other companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf. Examples of these services include sending postal mail and e-mail to you and analyzing data.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.</li>
        <li>Corporate Transfers and Financings: CrowdStar may share your Personal Information in connection with any merger, sale of CrowdStar assets, or a financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. </li>
        <li>Aggregate Information: CrowdStar may share aggregate information about you and/or your customers with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Links and Third Party Tools</h2>
    <p>The Service may contain links to other websites or applications. The fact that the Service links to a website or application or presents a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean that CrowdStar endorses or authorizes that third party, nor is it a representation of our affiliation with that third party. CrowdStar is in no way responsible for the privacy policies of these other websites to which you chose to access from the Service. Please be sure to read the privacy policies of those websites when exiting the Service.</p>

Each of these providers may provide an opt-out from their collection of information about you.  Please check the providers’ privacy policies for further information.  </p>

    <h2>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h2>
    <p>You may review, update, correct or delete any Personal Information by changing the applicable information through the SN Website.  If you completely delete all this information, your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@crowdstar.com">support@crowdstar.com</a>. You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from CrowdStar by following the instructions in those emails.  If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your accounts or our ongoing business relations.</p>

    <p>Under California law, California Residents who have an established business relationship with us may choose to opt out of the disclosure of personal information about them to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  As detailed above, our policy is not to disclose personal information collected online to a third party for direct marketing purposes without your approval.  If you choose to opt-out at any time after granting approval, email <a href="mailto:support@crowdstar.com">support@crowdstar.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We have put in place reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure.  However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to overcome those measures or use your Personal Information for improper purposes.  Also please note that email and messaging systems are not considered secure, so we discourage you from sending us Personal Information through these mediums.</p>

    <h2>International Transfer</h2>
    <p>We may transfer information that we collect about you, including Personal Information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
