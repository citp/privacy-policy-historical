How you can access your personal information
20.  You may request access to any personal information we hold about you at any time by contacting us
     by email. Where we hold personal information that you are entitled to access, we will try to provide you
     with suitable means of accessing it (for example, by emailing it to you). We may charge you a fee to cover
     our administrative and other reasonable costs in providing the information to you. We will not charge you
     for simply making the request, nor charge you for making any corrections to your personal information.
21.  There may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold. For
     example, we may need to refuse access if granting access would interfere with the privacy of others, would
     result in a breach of confidentiality, is contrary to natural justice or is prohibited by law. If this happens we
     will tell you when you request access to it.
22.  If you believe that the personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then
     you may request us to amend it. We will consider if the information requires amendment. If we do not
     agree that there are grounds for amendment, then we will add a note to the personal information stating
     that you disagree with it.
23.  You are entitled to ask us to erase your personal information or restrict its processing. These rights are
     limited in some circumstances for example if we have a legal requirement to process your personal
     information. In some instances, this may mean that we may retain some of your personal information even
     if you withdraw your consent.
