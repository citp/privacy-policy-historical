# Privacy Policy | CrowdStar

Last updated: August 27, 2013

CrowdStar, Inc. and its related entities (collectively "CrowdStar", "us", "our" or "we") is dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our users ("users" or "you"). This Privacy Policy describes the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information you provide in connection with our website at [www.crowdstar.com](http://www.crowdstar.com/) (the "Site") or any CrowdStar game or application provided on other websites or other third party sources (collectively, the "Service"). Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is limited to information collected by CrowdStar through your use of the Service.

By using the Service, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are responsible for periodically reading this Privacy Policy. If you use our Service after we have updated this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge that you have read the updated terms and consent to our revised privacy practices. Use of the Service after changes are made to the Privacy Policy will be considered your consent to the new terms.

## Information Collected and Used

CrowdStar's primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and enhance the Service and to enable users to easily navigate and enjoy the Service. CrowdStar may use user information to analyze user behavior in CrowdStar’s games. For example, CrowdStar may analyze user information to determine how often a user plays a particular game, if a user purchases premium goods and other similar events.

When you use any of the CrowdStar games or applications, we may collect and record information through the social networking website you use to access the Service or other third party source  (each a "SN Website") in accordance with the policies and terms of the SN Website. We may share such information with the SN Website for its use as permitted by the terms of your agreement and privacy settings with the SN Website.  SN Websites may include, for example, Facebook (such as Facebook Fanpages), Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube and Polyvore.

We may collect both Personal and Non-Personal Information. Personal Information is defined as information about you that can be used to contact or identify you such as your name, email address, home address, and phone number. Personal Information does not include aggregate information, which is data we collect about the characteristics and activities of users of the Service, from which any Personal Information has been removed. Non-Personal Information does not identify you personally and can include age, gender or interests. We may combine Personal Information with Non-Personal Information and use this combination to improve your experience or to aggregate it with information collected from other users to improve or analyze our Service. This privacy policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information or of Non-Personal Information.

The information we collect when you access the Service on an SN Website may include information that is visible on your social networking page such as: (1) your name, (2) SN Website user identification number and/or name, (3) locale, city, state and country, (4) sex, (5) birthdate, (6) time zone and (7) email address. We may also collect your email address directly from you when you access our Service. If you provide your email address in connection with a CrowdStar game, the email address will be retained by CrowdStar and we may use that email address to contact you about other CrowdStar games.

When you visit our Site or use the Service on an SN Website, your computer’s operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language and referring Web site addresses are logged automatically. We also collect information about your usage and activity, such as number of clicks, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of this activity. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services.

We may also acquire information from you through (1) your access and participation in message boards on the Service, (2) your email of a question to our customer support , (3) your purchase of a virtual product of any type, (4) your participation in surveys regarding the Service or (5) your participation in a sweepstakes or contest through the Service. Please note that because third parties manage the purchases of virtual goods offered by the Service, we do not have access to your credit card details and billing information.

If you launch any of our games or applications on a mobile device, we also collect information regarding your device type, iOS advertising identifiers, HTML cookies, Open UDID, referral URL, operating system and version, IP address and unique device ID (UDID). If you sign into the Service on your mobile device with Facebook Connect we will collect information that is visible via your Facebook account such as: (1) your first and last name, (2) Facebook ID, (3) Profile Picture/URL, and (4) list of Facebook friends. This information will be primarily used for social features.

If you provide your email address in connection with a Crowdstar game, the email address will be retained by Crowdstar and we may use that email address to contact you about your gaming experience. We may also use part of your email address for friend-to-friend interaction.
