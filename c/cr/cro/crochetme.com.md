# Privacy Policy | Crochet Me

## Privacy Policy

**Effective 26 August 2007**

## Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. As you've already noticed, we make it available on every page of our site. 

## The Information We Collect 

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on this website. On some pages, you enter personal information such as: 

Name   
Email address   
Birthdate 

## The Information We DON'T Collect

Credit/debit card information  
Full mailing address 

## The Way We Use Information

We use the information you provide about yourself during  
registration only to identify you as a registered user. We do not share this information with outside parties without your express permission; information you enter for display on your public profile is assumed to be permitted for public display. 

When you sign up to receive the Crochet Me Email Newsletter, we use your email address only for the purpose of delivering the newsletter to you. We do not share your email address with outside parties. When you send us email directly, we use  
return email addresses to answer the email you send us. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. The email address stored with your registration information might be used to automatically alert you to new content posted to CrochetMe.com. You can manage your notification preferences from your [profile](http://crochetme.com/user). 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable  
information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones  
described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

## How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information

You can access and manage all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by editing your [user profile](http://crochetme.com/user). 

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
