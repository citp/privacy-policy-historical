**Acceptance of TERMS and revisions**

By accessing the Site, submitting information to us (regardless of whether you register an account with us) or downloading, installing or using any of the Content or Services you accept this Privacy Policy.  If you do not accept this Privacy Policy you must not submit information to or register an account with us, access the Site or download, install or use any of the Content or Services.

We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time. We will give you notice of such revisions by posting the revised Privacy Policy at https://cronometer.com/privacy/. We will make a reasonable effort to inform you of changes to our Privacy Policy through pop-up notifications in the app and website, or by email. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are aware of the current Privacy Policy when you access or use the Site and/or Services. If you continue to access or use any of the Site and/or Services after any revisions to this Privacy Policy are posted you will be deemed to have accepted those revisions.

**Types of Information We Collect   **

There are two types of information we may collect through your access to and use of the Site and/or Services:

  * “Personal Information” means information about an identifiable individual (including any “Personal Information” as such term is defined in the _Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act_ , Canada or the _Personal Information Protection Act_ , British Columbia). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, a person’s name, email address, residential address, precise geolocation information (i.e., your specific location), telephone number, payment card information, transaction history, other billing information and, in some cases, user name.
  * “Non-Personal Information” means information that does not identify you and cannot be used to contact you personally and may include your date of birth, age, gender, postal code and non-precise geolocation information (e.g., your city), as well as information about your computer, mobile device, and/or media system platform and their hardware/software/firmware and including but not limited to your unique device ID, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or other persistent identifiers. Non-Personal Information also includes “Usage Data” which is anonymous data associated with your computer, mobile device, and/or media system platform, that includes, in-media time, activities, purchases, badges, and in full compliance with HIPAA and Privacy laws, and on an aggregated and anonymous basis, your diary entries, data and notes, recipes, targets and profile.



Note:  Under certain circumstances, Personal Information and/or Non-Personal Information may constitute PHI.  If HIPAA applies to such Personal Information and/or Non-Personal Information, we will take appropriate steps to comply with HIPAA’s privacy and security rule requirement.  For example, if we are a Business Associate of a Covered Entity, and if specific Personal Information and/or Non-Personal Information that we use or disclose as such a Business Associate is PHI, we will take appropriate steps to comply with HIPAA’s privacy and security rule requirement with respect to any such use and disclosure. 

**Application of this Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy only applies to the information that Cronometer collects and uses, or is supplied, through the access to and use of the Site and/or Services. Any information disclosed to any third party service providers is dealt with in accordance with the privacy policies adopted by each of those service providers. Individuals are encouraged to review the privacy policies maintained by each of those service providers to understand how their information will be used by those entities to process requests. For example, we partner with third party service providers and vendors to provide access to existing payment gateways and your credit card, banking and other billing information is kept with our payment processor Stripe and you can read about their privacy policy at the following link: _www.stripe.com_.

The Site and/or Services may contain links to third party websites (the “Linked Sites”) that are not controlled or operated by Cronometer. The Linked Sites are maintained by third parties who have their own privacy policies and their own terms and conditions of use. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of the Linked Sites and Cronometer is not responsible for any information disclosed to or collected by those Linked Sites or for the privacy practices of any operators or sponsors of the Linked Sites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we do not accept responsibility for any use of your information by such third parties, and we do not guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as Cronometer. To determine how your information will be treated when accessing or using the Linked Sites, you must read the privacy policy, if any, that applies to each of the Linked Sites.

**Protection of YOUR Information**

Cronometer has implemented reasonable physical and technical measures to protect the information we collect or are provided with from unauthorized access and against loss, misuse or alteration by third parties.

We do not warrant or represent that your information will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.  While we take reasonable efforts to safeguard Personal Information, we are not liable for any breach resulting from the limitations of the security of our systems.

Currently, Cronometer or our third party service providers retain and store information collected by, or provided to, us in the cloud and on secure, HIPAA compliant servers in the United States. As Cronometer and some of our third party service providers may retain and store information received from users (including Personal Information) outside of Canada, and under the laws of those other jurisdictions, in certain circumstances courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other provinces or foreign jurisdictions may be entitled to access users’ information.

Cronometer will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you access to your Personal Information (to the extent we are in possession of any) if you submit your request for access via privacy@cronometer.com.  Subject to applicable law, Cronometer reserves the right to deny access to your Personal Information on any of the following grounds:

  * when denial of access is required by law;
  * when granting you access is reasonably likely to negatively impact other people's privacy;
  * when granting access is, in our judgement and acting reasonably, cost prohibitive; or
  * when we have reason to believe that such requests are frivolous or made in bad faith.



You are responsible for ensuring that all information created through your access to and use of the Site and/or Services is accurate, reliable and complete and you acknowledge and accept that the use of such information is at your own risk. We ask that you keep the Personal Information that you provide to us current and correct.  Users can access and edit their account information under the Profile tab of the website or mobile app.

You represent and warrant that all Personal Information you provide us is true and correct and relates to you and not to any other person.

Those who choose to use or access the Site and/or Services from outside Canada do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and recognizing the global nature of the Internet, each viewer and user shall comply with all local rules regarding online conduct and submission of acceptable materials. This Privacy Policy is governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to principles of conflicts of law that would impose the law of another jurisdiction, and you accept and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the Province of British Columbia, Canada.

**International Transfer**

We may transfer information that we collect about you to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. Please note that these countries and jurisdictions may not have the same personal information protection laws as your own jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information over international borders and the use and disclosure of information about you, including Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.
