# Privacy Policy | Crowdfunder.co.uk

Date of posting: **24/05/18**

This Privacy Policy contains 11 sections.

#### 1\. Introduction

_Welcome to **Crowdfunder**. This policy explains how we handle and use your personal information and your rights in relation to that information. Under data protection law, Crowdfunder Limited is the controller of that information and responsible for its use and protection. As we operate a platform that allows our members to run fundraising projects and reach out to others for funding, those members may also be separately legally responsible for the use of your information in connection with those projects. _

Crowdfunder Limited ( **we** , **our** or **us** ) is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. 

This Privacy Policy explains why and how we will use the personal information that we have obtained from you or others, with whom we share it and the rights you have in connection with the information we use. Please read the following carefully. 

This policy describes the way we handle and use the personal information that we obtain from all the different interactions you may have with us as a business, including when you visit our offices, social media pages or website currently located at www.crowdfunder.co.uk ( **Site** ) or when you contact us or take part in any of our competitions or promotions. 

We, Crowdfunder Limited, are the controller in relation to the processing activities described below. This means that we decide why and how your personal information is processed. Please see the section at the end of this policy for our contact and legal information. 

Our members run fundraising campaigns from our Site and in doing so may collect personal information from you if you pledge funds to their projects. Their use of that information during and after their campaign (e.g. to keep in contact with you about progress of their project and their achievements) are uses of your information for which those members determine, independently of us. As a result, those members will be separate controllers of your personal information. 

We refer to ‘project owners’, ‘backers’ and ‘pledges’ throughout this document. For more information regarding these, please see our [Terms](https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/terms-conditions). 

This policy was last updated on the date that appears at the top of this page.

#### 6\. Transfers of your personal information outside of Europe

_Except in a limited number of cases, we do not transfer your personal information outside of Europe. Where we do, we take measures to protect your personal information._

All the personal information collected about you by us or on our behalf may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). By way of example, this may happen where any of our group companies are located in a country outside of the EEA or if any of our servers or those of our third party service providers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EEA. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK and so they may not protect the use of your personal information to the same extent. The non-EEA countries to which we transfer your personal information are listed in the table in Disclosure and sharing of your personal information by us.

If we transfer your information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this policy. These steps include imposing contractual obligations on the recipients of your personal information or ensuring that the recipients are subscribed to ‘international frameworks’ that aim to ensure adequate protection. For example, those of our third party service providers who receive your personal information in the USA may subscribe to the “EU-US Privacy Shield” framework. Where they do not, we ensure that we impose contractual obligations on them that are broadly equivalent as required by UK data protection law. Please contact us using the details at the end of this policy for more information about the protections that we put in place and to obtain a copy of the relevant documents.

If you use our services whilst you are outside the EEA, your information may be transferred outside the EEA in order to provide you with those services.

#### 7\. Security and links to other websites

_We take the security of your personal information seriously and use a variety of measures based on good industry practice to keep it secure. Nonetheless, transmissions over the internet and to our Site may not be completely secure, so please exercise caution. When accessing links to other websites, their privacy policies, not ours, will apply to your personal information._

We employ security measures to protect the personal information you provide to us, to prevent access by unauthorised persons and unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. When we have provided (or you have chosen) a password or pin allowing you access to certain parts of the Site, you are responsible for safeguarding it and keeping it confidential and you promise not to allow it to be used by third parties. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do everything possible to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information during its transmission to us online. You accept the inherent security implications of using the internet and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security unless we are at fault.

Our Site and social media pages may contain links to other websites run by other organisations which we do not control. This policy does not apply to those other websites‚ so we encourage you to read their privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites (even if you access them using links that we provide) and we provide links to those websites solely for your information and convenience. We specifically disclaim responsibility for their content, privacy practices and terms of use, and we make no endorsements, representations or promises about their accuracy, content or thoroughness. Your disclosure of personal information to third party websites is at your own risk.

In addition, if you linked to our Site from a third party website, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners and operators of that third party website and recommend that you check the policy of that third party website.

#### 8\. The periods for which we retain your personal information

_We will not hold your personal information in an identifiable format for any longer than is necessary for the purposes for which we collected it. For certain purposes we retain your personal information for a very short period whilst for others we retain it for a period of 7 years after the information is no longer required for business reasons so that we can deal with any legal proceedings that could arise._

###### We retain your personal information for the following periods:

Type of personal information | How long do we keep your personal information?  
---|---  
Registration information | 7 years from the date your account is closed for any reason.  
Information (other than registration information) relating to projects/project owners including pledged amounts | For unsuccessful projects, 7 years from the date your account is closed for any reason. For successful projects, indefinitely (but please see exceptions below).  
Information relating to backers (other than registration information) including pledge history | 7 years from the date your account is closed for any reason.  
Identity documents | If we require these for financial or fraud verification purposes, 7 years. If we require these to share with our payment processors for client verification purposes, 6 months. If we require these to verify your identity for a request by you in connection with your rights over your personal information (see below), 2 years.  
Web traffic and device information | 26 months from the date of collection.  
  
Social media handles

Complaints and queries | 2 years, except where these relate to legal claims, in which case 7 years.  
  
###### The only exceptions to the periods mentioned above are where:

  * you exercise your right to have the information erased (where it applies) and we do not need to hold it in connection with any of the reasons permitted or required under the law (see further Your rights in relation to your personal information); 
  * you exercise your right to require us to retain your personal information for a period longer than our stated retention period (see further Your rights in relation to your personal information); 
  * we bring or defend a legal claim or other proceedings during the period we retain your personal information, in which case we will retain your personal information until those proceedings have concluded and no further appeals are possible; 
  * we archive the information, in which case we will delete it in accordance with our deletion cycle; or 
  * in limited cases, existing or future law or a court or regulator requires us to keep your personal information for a longer or shorter period. 



#### 9\. Your rights in relation to your personal information

_You have a number of rights in relation to your personal information under data protection law. In relation to certain rights, we may ask you for information to verify your identity and, where applicable, to help us to search for your personal information. Except in rare cases, we will respond to you within 30 days after we have received this information or, where no such information is required, after we have received full details of your request.You have the following rights, some of which may only apply in certain circumstances:_

###### 9.1. To be informed about the processing of your personal information (this is what this policy sets out to do);

###### 9.2. To have your personal information corrected if it is inaccurate and to have incomplete personal information completed;

The accuracy of your information is important to us and we make it easy for you to review and correct the personal information that we hold about you in your Profile. If you change your name or address/email address, or you discover that any of the other information we hold is inaccurate or out of date, you can let us know by contacting us in any of the details described at the end of this policy but we ask you to first check that you cannot correct your details using the tools in your Profile.

When downloading a list of backers on their project, project owners will see the address details of those members who pledged on their project. Please note that if you change your address after the project owner has downloaded this data (this usually happens once their project is successful) the details the project owner may become out of date, until the project owner downloads a new list of data - so we would recommend also contacting the project owner to inform them of a change to your contact details.

######  9.3. To object to processing of your personal information;

Where we rely on our legitimate interests as the legal basis for processing your personal information for particular purposes, you may object to us using your personal information for these purposes by emailing or writing to us at the address at the end of this policy. Except for the purposes for which we are sure we can continue to process your personal information, we will temporarily stop processing your personal information in line with your objection until we have investigated the matter. If we agree that your objection is justified in accordance with your rights under data protection laws, we will permanently stop using your data for those purposes. Otherwise we will provide you with our justification as to why we need to continue using your data.

You may object to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes and we will automatically comply with your request. If you would like to do so, please use our unsubscribe tool.

###### 9.4. To withdraw your consent to processing your personal information;

Where we rely on your consent as the legal basis for processing your personal information, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the details at the end of this policy. If you would like to withdraw your consent to receiving any direct marketing to which you previously opted-in, you can also do so using our unsubscribe tool.

You can also opt out of receiving our newsletter at any time by editing your Profile settings (login, click your name at the top right of the website then choose Profile settings).

You can choose to receive or opt-out of future marketing from Projects you have pledged on.

The project owner will be responsible for handling your information after they receive it from us. The project owner, when downloading a list of backers on their project will see who has elected to receive further updates.

You can also choose to receive or opt-out of updates from Projects you have pledged on.

Please note that our standard receipt emails and notifications or a Project closing successfully or unsuccessfully contain important financial information regarding your pledge and so cannot be turned off.

If you withdraw your consent, our use of your personal information before you withdraw is still lawful.

###### 9.5. To restrict processing of your personal information;

You may ask us to restrict the processing your personal information in the following situations:where you believe it is unlawful for us to do so,you have objected to its use and our investigation is pending or you require us to keep it in connection with legal proceedings.

In these situations, we may only process your personal information whilst its processing is restricted if we have your consent or are legally permitted to do so, for example for storage purposes, to protect the rights of another individual or company or in connection with legal proceedings.

###### 9.6. To have your personal information erased;

In certain circumstances, you may ask for your personal information to be removed from our systems by emailing or writing to us at the address at the end of this policy. Unless there is a reason that the law allows us to use your personal information for longer, we will make reasonable efforts to comply with your request.

###### 9.7. To request access to your personal information and information about how we process it;

You have the right to ask for a copy of the information that we hold about you by emailing or writing to us at the address at the end of this policy. We may not provide you with a copy of your personal information if this concerns other individuals or we have another lawful reason to withhold that information.

Remember, you can access a lot of your personal information through your account: You can see a record of the pledges you have made in the My pledges section (login, click your name at the top right of the website then choose My pledges).

  * You can also see a record of the projects you have created and run - see the My projects section. 
  * You can also review and edit the personal information you have provided to Crowdfunder via your Profile settings. 



If you wish to make a Subject access request please first check you cannot get the data from the areas listed above. If you wish to access data not listed there please be specific in your request and send us a message to support@crowdfunder.co.uk . We will then, in adherence with the ICO guidelines , respond to your request.

###### 9.8. To electronically move, copy or transfer your personal information in a standard, machine-readable form;

Where we rely on your consent as the legal basis for processing your personal information or need to process it in connection with a contract in place directly with you, you may ask us to provide you with a copy of that information in a structured data file. We will provide this to you electronically in a structured, commonly used and machine readable form, such as a CSV file.

You can ask us to send your personal information directly to another service provider, and we will do so if this is technically possible. We may not provide you with a copy of your personal information if this concerns other individuals or we have another lawful reason to withhold that information.

###### 9.9. Rights relating to automated decision making, including profiling. 

We do not envisage that any decisions that have a legal or significant effect on you will be taken about you using purely automated means, however we will update this policy and inform you if this position changes.

After completing an expression of interest form for funding from one of our partners we will show you partner funds you may be eligible for. You can view the [full list of funds](https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/funds) at any time. Part of your eligibility for a fund may include automated processes, but the decision to approve funding will not be purely automated.

You have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection regulator in Europe, in particular in a country you work or live or where your legal rights have been infringed. The contact details for the Information Commissioner’s Office ( **ICO** ), the data protection regulator in the UK, are available on the [ICO website](https://ico.org.uk/), where your personal information has or is being used in a way that you believe does not comply with data, however, we encourage you to contact us before making any complaint and we will seek to resolve any issues or concerns you may have.
