<h2 id="id1"><a class="anchor" id="intro">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>CrowdFlower takes large, data-heavy projects and breaks them into small tasks that are distributed to more than a million on-demand contributors globally. This privacy policy (“Policy”) explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by CrowdFlower, Inc.(“CrowdFlower”, “we” or “us”) with respect to your use of any CrowdFlower website, mobile site or application which links to this Policy (each a “Site”) and any use of the CrowdFlower service (the “Service”) so you can make an informed decision about using the Site.</p>

<p><strong>We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.</strong></p>

<h2 id="id2"><a class="anchor" id="personal">2. What Is Personal Information?</a></h2>

<p>The term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual or enables others to contact an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or credit card number). It also includes other information about an individual when it is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or Service or about a group or category of services or users, from which personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>

<h2 id="id3"><a class="anchor" id="information">3. What Information Do We Collect?</a></h2>
