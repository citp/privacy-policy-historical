<h3>1 Introduction</h3>
<p><strong>1.1</strong> Crowdfunder.co.uk, including the services we offer through it, (“Crowdfunder.co.uk”) is owned and operated by Crowdfunder Ltd. (formerly KEO PF.it Ltd) (“Crowdfunder”, “we”, “us” or “our” as appropriate). For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998, the data controller is Crowdfunder Ltd.</p>
<p><strong>1.2</strong> We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of users of Crowdfunder.co.uk. Please read the following Privacy Policy to understand how the information you provide is used and protected. If you have any queries or concerns regarding these practices, please contact us by emailing <a href="mailto:support@Crowdfunder.co.uk">support@Crowdfunder.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 </strong>Please note that by visiting and using Crowdfunder.co.uk you are agreeing to the use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><a name="info"></a></p>
<h3>2 The information we collect and how we use it</h3>
<p><strong>2.1</strong> The information we collect on Crowdfunder.co.uk and the way we use that information includes the following:</p>
<p><em>When creating an account and joining the Crowdfunder.co.uk community, we collect:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your email address – this is not displayed publicly on Crowdfunder.co.uk. We use this information for the following purposes<br></strong>to manage and communicate with you about your access to, or use of, Crowdfunder.co.uk, as well as to inform you of updates to your account;</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>if you choose to support a project, we provide your e-mail address to the creator of the project(‘Project Owner’) once the project you have backed is successful to enable you to have direct discussions with him/her about the project;</li>
<li>to send you e-alerts when there is activity on a project that you have created, are supporting or are watching;</li>
<li>to send you newsletters from time to time containing news regarding activity and content on Crowdfunder.co.uk, unless you indicate that you do not wish to receive these emails at the time you enter your details on the registration page for Crowdfunder.co.uk. If you wish to stop receiving these newsletters, or e-alerts, you can do so at any time, by following the instructions in clause 11 ‘Editing your settings and unsubscribing from Crowdfunder.co.uk emails’;</li>
<li>ask you about your Crowdfunder.co.uk successes (e.g. if you successfully completed a Project). Any responses to such requests will be purely on a voluntary basis;</li>
<li>reply to any correspondence you send to us; andfor any other reasonable purposes related to Crowdfunder.co.uk or your membership.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Your name. This is not displayed publicly on the Crowdfunder.co.uk unless you choose to display your name, rather than your username, when you support a Project. If the project you choose to support is successful in reaching its target funding within the target timescale, then, unless you pledge anonymously, your name (as shown on your bank account) is given to the Project Owner by our payment processors, GoCardless and Stripe, when your funds are taken from your account</strong><strong>.</strong></strong></li>
<li><strong><strong>By pledging you agree that your personal details given to the Project Owner may be used as relevant for reward fulfilment (i.e. your name on a wall of fame). If your details are used for anything else please contact the Project Owner. Please see our <a href="http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/terms-conditions">Terms and Conditions</a> for the contract between you and the project owner.</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Your username – we ask you to provide a username by which you can be identified publicly. Please note that your username should not feature your last name or contain any other personal information that could be used to identify you (e.g. your address). If your username with Facebook (or any other third party authentication provider) contains personal information, we recommend you do not use such third party facilities to link to Crowdfunder.co.uk and instead create a Crowdfunder.co.uk account in the standard way. We reserve the right to reject usernames that are offensive, defamatory or which we otherwise think are unsuitable. If the project you choose to support is successful in reaching its target funding within the target timescale, then we will provide your username to the Project Owner so that they can contact you to arrange for your reward.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Your postcode – Your postcode will not be disclosed to the public, except in the circumstances noted in the first paragraph below. We use your postcode:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>if you are a Project Owner, to identify the location on the Crowdfunder.co.uk map in which your project is taking place, in order for Community Members to search for projects near a postcode; and</li>
<li>to provide you with information (including content and projects) that you might find interesting based on your location, (e.g. projects local to you).</li>
<li>If you have pledged on a reward which requires an address your address will be given to the Project Owner when the project is successful for use during reward fulfilment.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Any personal information you choose to include in your ‘My Profile’ page (e.g. your photo). We use this information:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>to populate your profile. You photo is viewable by other users, where for example, you choose to support a Project. No other information in your profile is made publicly available by us; and</li>
<li>to facilitate interaction between Community Members.</li>
<li>Authentication providers</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If you choose to create a Crowdfunder.co.uk account using Facebook Connect (or any other authentication provider), we are provided with profile and photo data about you through their application programming interface (API). We use this to create your account, allow you to interact with Crowdfunder.co.uk and in some instances to identify you publicly on Crowdfunder.co.uk. For example, if you choose to support a Project, the photo from your Facebook profile will then be viewable by other users. By clicking on the authentication providers’ link, you are consenting to share this information with us.</li>
<li>As a project owner we collect your phone number, date of birth, postcode, first name and last name. We reserve the right to use this data to send to a third party provider to verify your personal details. These details are not publically accessible, your postcode and date of birth are encrypted on our servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you post information during use of Crowdfunder.co.uk, we collect:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Any other personal information you choose to disclose during your use of Crowdfunder.co.uk. </strong><strong>Examples include when you update your profile, list a news item, post a guide, make a comment, upload a photo, share a link, create a Project, send someone a message or otherwise engage in the Crowdfunder.co.uk community. This information is viewable by other users. We use this information to:</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>enable you to engage more fully with the Crowdfunder.co.uk community;</li>
<li>enable other members to search for you and communicate with you; and</li>
<li>enable other members to provide you with feedback.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="personal"></a></p>
<h3>3 How else we use your personal information?</h3>
<p><strong>3.1</strong> We may use your personal information to investigate a complaint made by a user of Crowdfunder.co.uk, or a breach of Crowdfunder.co.uk’s Terms of Use and to prevent and detect criminal activity, fraud and misuse of or damage to Crowdfunder.co.uk or the service made available through it and to prosecute those responsible.</p>
<p><a name="sharing"></a></p>
<h3>4 Information sharing and disclosure</h3>
<p><strong>4.1</strong> We share your personal information with selected third parties for the purpose of managing and administering the accounts and services provided to you through Crowdfunder.co.uk. We may further share and disclose this information with (i) other services that we own and/or operate; and (ii) third party sites that are affiliated to Crowdfunder.co.uk for example energyshare (“Sister Services”), in order to better integrate those services with Crowdfunder.co.uk.</p>
<p><strong>4.2</strong> We do not sell or rent your personal information. We may, however, disclose information about you to the following, for the express purposes set out below:</p>
<p><em>If you create an account with Crowdfunder.co.uk:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>to our employees and agents for them to administer any accounts or services provided to you through Crowdfunder.co.uk. e.g. the sending of e-alerts on our behalf.</li>
<li>if you check the relevant box to permit communications from our Sister Sites, to those partners, their employees and agents for them to send you communications regarding goods and services they offer.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you post content:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>as a member you are publicly identified to other users of Crowdfunder.co.uk by your username. We therefore recommend that you do not use your real name as your username or provide any other personally identifiable information on the publicly viewable site, like your name or contact details;</li>
<li>we may display some information that is publicly available on Crowdfunder.co.uk, on third party websites that are closely connected to the Crowdfunder.co.uk project and wish to embed Crowdfunder.co.uk activity. So, by way of example, user generated content such as titles of users’ posts on Crowdfunder.co.uk groups would be displayed on such third party sites with a link back to Crowdfunder.co.uk. To the extent that usernames or personal information is included in that user generated content on Crowdfunder.co.uk, it may be displayed on such third party sites. So for example if a listing included a username or a member’s photo, that information may also be displayed on the third party website. Just to be clear, this information will be embedded on any such third party website as a link. We will not hand over that information to the third party website;</li>
<li>we may display some information that is publicly available on Crowdfunder.co.uk in the regular newsletters that are emailed to all registered users on the Crowdfunder.co.uk mailing list.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Transfer of business:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If there is a change (or prospective change) in the ownership of Crowdfunder Ltd. or any of its assets, we may have to disclose personal information to the new (or prospective) owner. If we do so, we will require them to keep it confidential and use it in accordance with the terms of our Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Legal requests:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Apart from the use and sharing of your personal information in the limited circumstances already described, the only ways we may share your information are if we need to disclose personal information to protect our and our licensors’ rights and property or to comply with any applicable law or valid legal process.<em><br></em></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="payment"></a></p>
<h3>5 Payment providers</h3>
<p><strong>5.1</strong> If you decide to support a Project by making a financial contribution to it using GoCardless, you will be directed to the payment processor GoCardless to process your payment. You will be invited to set-up a Direct Debit mandate with GoCardless. If the Project is successful in reaching 100% of its target funding within its target timescale, GoCardless will execute a one-off direct debit from your account only.</p>
<p><strong>5.2</strong> GoCardless operates a secure server to process your payments details. They encrypt the account information you provide and once a Project has successfully reached its target funding within its target timescale, will authorise the debit from your account directly. This means that your account details are never revealed to us. Please read their privacy policy at <a href="https://gocardless.com/privacy">[GoCardless privacy policy]</a>to see what security measures they have in place and how they treat your information.</p>
<p><strong>5.3</strong> If you decide to support a Project by making a financial contribution to it using PayPal you will be directed to the payment processor PayPal to process your payment. Please read PayPal's <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_privacy_pop-outside&amp;popup=1&amp;country.x=US" target="_blank">privacy policy</a> to learn your privacy rights regarding PayPal's collection, use, storage, sharing and protection of your personal information.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><strong>5.4</strong> If you decide to support a Project by making a financial contribution to it using Stripe you will be prompted to enter your: Full Name, Credit/Debit Card Details &amp; Billing Address in order to process your payment. Please read Stripe’s <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/privacy"><span class="s3">privacy policy</span></a> to learn what policies Stripe has to manage and protect your personal information.</span></p>
<p><a name="using"></a></p>
<h3>6 Using information about other Crowdfunder.co.uk users</h3>
<p><strong>6.1</strong> You should avoid sharing any personal information including contact information with any other Crowdfunder.co.uk members. If you intend to share any such information, please exercise the same level of caution as you would dealing with a stranger. Never give any personal information to anyone until you are confident that it is safe to do so. You should in any event only reveal such personal information via secure communications that cannot be viewed by other people. You must treat any personal information that you receive from other Crowdfunder.co.uk members as private, confidential and use it only for the purposes for which the member provides it to you unless that member indicates to you otherwise.</p>
<p><a name="aggregated"></a></p>
<h3>7 Aggregated Information</h3>
<p><strong>7.1</strong> We may share non-personal aggregated statistics data about visitors to Crowdfunder.co.uk and traffic patterns with third parties such as our Sister Services. Just to be clear, this information does not identify users in any personal capacity; it just gives generalised information about the users of Crowdfunder.co.uk.</p>
<p><a name="cookies"></a></p>
<h3>8 Cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies and log files</p>
<p><strong>8.1</strong>While on Crowdfunder.co.uk, certain information is automatically logged about how you are using Crowdfunder.co.uk. This information may include the URL of the website which linked you to this site, your IP address and the pages you visit while on Crowdfunder.co.uk. The IP address indicates the location of your computer on the internet. We keep a record of each user’s activity by reference to the IP address of the internet connection(s) they use to access Crowdfunder.co.uk. These logs enable us to prevent users who breach the rules of the Crowdfunder.co.uk community set out in our Terms of Use by refusing communications from their IP addresses to the website. If you are concerned that we have blocked an IP address that you use to access Crowdfunder.co.uk in error, please email us at support@Crowdfunder.co.uk.</p>
<p><strong>8.2</strong> We may also store information about you using cookies (files which are sent by us to your computer or other access device) which we can access when you visit our site in future. We do this to recognise you as a user when you return to this website using the same device and web browser.</p>
<p>If you want to delete any cookies that are already on your computer, please refer to the instructions for your file management software to locate the file or directory that stores cookies. Our cookies will have the file names ESSID.txt, PHPSESSID.txt, __atssc.txt, __atuvc.txt, __utma.txt, __utmb.txt, __utmc.txt, __utmz.txt, _jsuid.txt, _j.txt.</p>
<p>Information on deleting or controlling cookies is available at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. Please note that by deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our site.</p>

<p><strong>8.3</strong> We use data from Google's Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) with Google Analytics for marketing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>8.4</strong> By using Crowdfunder.co.uk, you are agreeing to the use of the cookies listed above.</p>
<p><a name="links"></a></p>
<h3>9 Links</h3>
<p><strong>9.1</strong> Crowdfunder.co.uk contains links (sometimes posted by us, and sometimes by users) to third party websites that are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Read the <a href="http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/terms-conditions/">Terms of Use</a> for further information on these links. We strongly recommend that you read the privacy policy of any such websites that you visit.</p>
<h2><a name="protect"></a>10 How do we protect personal information?</h2>
<p><strong>10.1</strong> Crowdfunder.co.uk contains links (sometimes posted by us, and sometimes by users) to third party websites that are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Read the <a href="http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/terms-conditions/">Terms of Use</a> for further information on these links. We strongly recommend that you read the privacy policy of any such websites that you visit.</p>
<p><strong>10.2</strong> As required by the UK Data Protection laws, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given to us, to prevent unauthorised access. In particular, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt your password. SSL encrypts the information you provide as it travels through the Internet. Encryption creates billions of code combinations to protect each transaction made on the website, so your password or information cannot be viewed by anyone else using the internet.
