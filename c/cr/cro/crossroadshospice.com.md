                        Notice of Crossroads Hospice Privacy Practices
THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND
DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT
CAREFULLY.
USE AND DISCLOSURE OF HEALTH INFORMATION
Crossroads Hospice (“Hospice”) may use your health information, information that constitutes Protected
Health Information (“PHI”) as defined in the Privacy Rule of the Administrative Simplification provisions of
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, for purposes of providing you treatment,
obtaining payment for your care and conducting health care operations. PHI means any information about
you that identifies you or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to
identify you. The Hospice has established policies to guard against unnecessary disclosure of your health
information.
THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH AND PURPOSES FOR
WHICH YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED:
To Provide Treatment. The Hospice may use your health information to coordinate care within the
Hospice and with others involved in your care, such as your attending physician, members of the Hospice
interdisciplinary team and other health care professionals who have agreed to assist the Hospice in
coordinating care. For example, physicians involved in your care will need information about your
symptoms in order to prescribe appropriate medications. The Hospice also may disclose your health care
information to individuals outside of the Hospice involved in your care including family members (unless
you ask us not to), pharmacists, suppliers of medical equipment or other health care professionals.
To Obtain Payment. The Hospice may include your health information in invoices to collect payment
from third parties for the care you receive from the Hospice. For example, the Hospice may be required
by your health insurer to provide information regarding your health care status so that the insurer will
reimburse you or the Hospice. The Hospice also may need to obtain prior approval from your insurer and
may need to explain to the insurer your need for hospice and the services that will be provided to you.
To Conduct Health Care Operations. The Hospice may use and disclose health information for its own
operations in order to facilitate the function of the Hospice and as necessary to provide quality care to all
of the Hospice’s patients. Health care operations include such activities as:
       • Quality assessment and improvement activities.
       • Activities designed to improve health or reduce health care costs.
       • Protocol development, case management and care coordination.
       • Contacting health care providers and patients with information about treatment alternatives and
          other related functions that do not include treatment.
       • Professional review and performance evaluation.
       • Training programs including those in which students, trainees or practitioners in health care learn
          under supervision.
       • Training of non-health care professionals.
       • Accreditation, certification, licensing or credentialing activities.
       • Review and auditing, including compliance reviews, medical reviews, legal services and
          compliance programs.
       • Business planning and development including cost management and planning related analyses
          and formulary development.
       • Business management and general administrative activities of the Hospice.


                 Notice of Crossroads Hospice Privacy Practices (continued)
For example, the Hospice may use your health information to evaluate its staff performance, combine your
health information with other Hospice patients in evaluating how to more effectively serve all Hospice
patients, disclose your health information to Hospice staff and contracted personnel for training purposes,
use your health information to contact you as a reminder regarding a visit to you, or contact you for
community information mailings (unless you tell us you do not want to be contacted).
Marketing. We may contact you to give you information about products or services related to your
treatment, case management or care coordination, or to direct or recommend other treatments or health-
related benefits and services that may be of interest to you. We will not use or disclose your medical
information for marketing purposes without your written authorization.
For Appointment Reminders. The Hospice may use and disclose your health information to contact you
as a reminder that you have an appointment for a home visit.
For Treatment Alternatives. The Hospice may use and disclose your health information to tell you
about or recommend possible treatment options or alternatives that may be of interest to you.
THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH AND PURPOSES FOR
WHICH YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION MAY ALSO BE USED AND DISCLOSED.
When Legally Required. The Hospice will disclose your health information when it is required to do so
by Federal, State and local law.
When There Are Risks to Public Health. The Hospice may disclose your health information for public
activities and purposes in order to:
          Prevent or control disease, injury or disability, report disease, injury, vital events such as birth or
          death and the conduct of public health surveillance, investigations and interventions.
       •  Notify the State Department of Health that a person may have been exposed to a disease or may
          be at risk for contracting or spreading a disease or condition such as HIV, syphilis, or other
          sexually transmitted diseases.
       •  Report adverse events, product defects, to track products or enable product recalls, repairs and
          replacements and to conduct post-marketing surveillance and compliance with requirements of
          the Food and Drug Administration.
       •  Notify appropriate persons in order to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to you or
          to the health and safety of a particular person or the general public.
To Report Abuse, Neglect Or Domestic Violence. The Hospice is allowed to notify government
authorities if the Hospice believes a patient is the victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. The
Hospice will make this disclosure only when specifically required or authorized by law or when the patient
agrees to the disclosure.
To Conduct Health Oversight Activities. The Hospice may disclose your health information to a health
oversight agency for activities including audits, civil administrative or criminal investigations, inspections,
licensure or disciplinary action. The Hospice, however, may not disclose your health information if you are
the subject of an investigation and your health information is not directly related to your receipt of health
care of public benefits.
In Connection With Judicial And Administrative Proceedings. The Hospice may disclose your health
information in the course of any judicial or administrative proceeding in response to an order of a court or
administrative tribunal as expressly authorized by such order or in response to a subpoena, discovery

about the request or to obtain an order protecting your health information.

       •  Under certain limited circumstances, when you are the victim of a crime.

                  Your Rights With Respect To Your Health Information
You have the following rights regarding your health information that the Hospice maintains:
     • Right to request restrictions. You may request restrictions on certain uses and disclosures of
       your health information. You have the right to request a limit on the Hospice’s disclosure of your

       However, the Hospice is not required to agree to your request. If you wish to make a request for
       restrictions, please contact the Privacy Officer Designee listed at the end of this Notice.
     • Right to receive confidential communications. You have the right to request that the Hospice
       communicate with you in a certain way. For example, you may ask that the Hospice only conduct
       communications pertaining to your health information with you privately with no other family
       members present. If you wish to receive confidential communications, please contact the Privacy
       Officer Designee listed at the end of this Notice. The Hospice will not request that you provide
       any reasons for your request and will attempt to honor your reasonable requests for confidential

     • Right to amend health care information. You or your personal representative have the right
       to request that the Hospice amend your records, if you believe that your health information is

       the Hospice. A request for an amendment of records must be made in writing to the Privacy
       Officer Designee listed at the end of this Notice. The Hospice may deny the request if it is not in
       writing or does not include a reason for the amendment. The request also may be denied if your
       health information records were not created by the Hospice, if the records you are requesting are
       not part of the Hospice’s records, if the health information you wish to amend is not part of the
       health information you or your representative are permitted to inspect and copy, or if, in the
       opinion of the Hospice, the records containing your health information are accurate and complete.
     • Right to an accounting. You or your personal representative have the right to request an
       accounting of disclosures of your health information made by the Hospice for certain reasons,
