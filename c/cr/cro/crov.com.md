3\.  Client/Customer Data Access

Clients have access via authenticated (ID & Password) which enables them to gain access and update information in their respective profiles. 

Cookies:Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your end device for record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's end device. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.

IP Addresses: IP addresses are used by your end device every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by end device on the network to identify your device. IP addresses are automatically collected by our server as part of demographic and profile data known as "traffic data" so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. Crov will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information.

4\.  Sharing of Information

In order to facilitate interaction among Crov users our service may allow you to access certain information about other users in Crov. By entering into our Terms of Use, you agree to treat information about other users of Crov in strict accordance with such Terms of Use. In addition, under no circumstances, except as defined in this section, can you disclose personally identifiable information about another user to any third party without Crov’s consent and the consent of such other user after adequate prior written notice provided to such user. Crov does not sell or rent any personally identifiable information to third parties. Note that law enforcement personnel are given different rights with respect to the information they access.

Information collected by Crov is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. All of our employees and contractors are dedicated to maintaining and upholding your privacy and security and are aware of our privacy and security policies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information within our systems, Crov cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Payments can be initiated on our site and are processed by a third party vendor such as PayPal or others.
