Respecting Your Rights **The privacy policy below explains in detail how we collect and use information about our users. We take your privacy very seriously. We won't rent, sell, or loan any information about you. We only provide information in aggregate to our advertisers -- never individual information. You're safe with us.**

Crosswalk.com takes your trust - and your right to privacy - very seriously. The following privacy policy outlines for your review the type of information we gather - and how we use it - from members, registered users and visitors of www.crosswalk.com and related areas (email newsletters, job search applications, and so on). 

**Crosswalk.com gathers two types of information:**

  1. Registration data, which you provide directly in order to receive optional access to certain services or site areas and which may or may not require both demographic information (name, email address, zip code, age, and so on) and preference information (username, password, desired newsletters, and so on),   

  2. Usage information, which is automatically provided by each user's browser for each page requested on our site (commonly referred to as web site log data).

Registration Data   
This data is analyzed and presented as appropriate to third parties such as advertisers only in an aggregate form, primarily for the purpose of supporting the free provision of content and services at crosswalk.com via the most appropriate and relevant advertising messaging possible. Select partners who provide individualized services such as CCNmail or Financial Passport to crosswalk.com users receive individual data as necessary to provide their services and only when such data is provided directly by our users. Crosswalk.com and said partners may only disclose to other third parties certain aggregate information contained in users' registration applications. Neither crosswalk.com nor partners will disclose any individual user's name, address, e-mail address or telephone number without such user's prior consent, except to the extent necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws or in legal proceedings where such information is relevant. 

Crosswalk.com does not knowingly accept or use personal profile information from children 12 years old or younger. 

Usage (Log) Data   
We gather and analyze users' current Internet Protocol (IP) addresses -- an address typically assigned to individual browsers by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) -- to help with a variety of site management issues, none of which allow us to connect your IP address with your personal identity. For example, we use log data to: 

  

  * diagnose problems with our server,   

  * evaluate the sources of our user traffic (ie. where site visitors clicked from to reach us),   

  * determine traffic patterns through our site (to build better internal links and improve your ability to find what you want),   

  * understand and optimize our site for the broadest selection of browser types (again, to improve your experience).

Cookies   
Our site uses cookies to improve our general recognition of repeat visitors and to simplify your experience while you're visiting us. Cookies are electronic "tags" we place on your browser to help our servers recognize you; while you're on our site, cookies help insure things like:   


  * you don't see the same ads repeatedly,   

  * you can get customized (ie. selected by you) information without having to ask for it every visit,   

  * you only have to log-in once - when it's even necessary - when you visit certain "members-only" areas,   

  * and so on.

  
Occasionally, our advertisers will also place cookies on your browser when you click on their ads from our site. This enables them to track the effectiveness of their ads. In most cases, cookies will only be placed when the ad is served to the page you're viewing. In no case will any advertiser receive specific registration data for any user as a result of cookies or any other agreement with crosswalk.com without your prior explicit consent. (note: accepting a cookie does not constitute consent for providing personal registration data). 

Finally, cookies provide us with no information about who you are or where you go on the Internet when you are not at our site. 

Opt-In   
Crosswalk.com acquires no personal or registration data about our users except what you explicitly and voluntarily provide (ie. opt-in). We reserve the right to use this information specifically for the purposes related to your registration and generally for any necessary future communication regarding your registration or status. 

As part of your free subscription, from time to time we will deliver messages from our ministry and advertising partners that we believe would be of specific interest to you. If you would prefer not to receive these occasional messages we will discontinue them at your request. 

Correcting and updating   
User registration data can be corrected or updated by e-mailing our members services at registrar@crosswalk.com. Delete/Deactivate   
To delete or deactivate an account, a user must send an email from the original email address that created the account to registrar@crosswalk.com and ask to be removed from our database.  |
