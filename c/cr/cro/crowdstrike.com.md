**Blog –** Accessing our blog will load social media cookies that are necessary for displaying content and enabling user interaction. If you make posts to our blogs, your words and identity are made available to other people using the blog. We are under no obligation to publish, maintain, or retain any of your posts.

From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from third party sources where those parties have indicated that they have your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal information to us. For example, we may be provided with information about individuals interested in using our offerings or joining our company.

### 2.3 With Whom Does CrowdStrike Share My Personal Information?

We do not sell, trade, or rent the personal information we collect from our Websites to others. We may share aggregated demographic information regarding visitors and users of our Websites with our affiliates, business partners, and advertisers for the purposes outlined above. When we collect personal information through our Offerings, it is made available to the CrowdStrike customer who was the source of the information and we use it as described in the Privacy Notice, terms and conditions, or otherwise as directed by our customers.

**Online Behavioral Advertising –** We partner with a third party to display advertising on our Websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies, beacons, scripts and tags to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites to provide you advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt out by visiting Digital Advertising (DAA)’s self-regulatory opt-out page, click [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). If you are located in the European Economic Area, click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads; you will continue to receive generic ads.

**Service Providers –** We may use third party service providers or partners to help us operate our business; provide, support, maintain, or secure our Offerings and our Websites; or administer activities on our behalf, such as events or marketing campaigns. It may be necessary to provide or allow access to your personal information to these third-party service providers or partners for those purposes.

## 3\. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information (EEA Visitors Only)

If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, CrowdStrike’s legal basis for collecting and using the personal information collected will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

In most circumstances, we collect personal information (i) where it is needed for the performance of a contract, (ii) where the processing of the personal information is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where you provide your consent. Other times, your personal information may be collected in order for us (iv) to comply with a legal obligation, (v) to perform a task for the public interest, or (vi) for the protection of your or another’s vital interests.

If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests or those of any third party, we will make clear to you at the relevant time through this notice or otherwise what those legitimate interests are. Often times, legitimate interests involve our normal day-to-day operations, such as the ability to operate our platform and communicating with you as necessary to provide our services, responding to your inquiries, or marketing. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided at the bottom of this Privacy Notice.

We may also use cookies, web beacons, tracking technologies, and the personal information they collect to tailor our Websites, Web Portal, and communications so they are more relevant to a user’s interests.

## 5\. Offerings

Most of the information we collect through our Offerings is metadata. Metadata may include how and when a device or network is being used, login times and attempts, registry keys, types and versions of operating systems, browsers, and information about software applications. In some cases, we collect personal information as it may appear within the metadata such as that associated with usernames, filenames, file paths, and machine names. This personal information is used to help our customers and improve our capabilities in the way described in our more specific product or service documentation and agreements. CrowdStrike’s Offerings also include features providing customers the ability to submit files (including the content of those files) and other information related to the files for purposes including security analysis and response, product improvement, enhanced capabilities, or customer support. At the direction of customers, we may also collect or retrieve files as part of our Offerings.

An important type of data we detect, collect, analyze, and use through our Offerings (or provide our customers the ability to provide to us) is information about adversaries, for example, malware and URLs where adversaries try to send your data. We often discover this type of information from analyzing samples customers provide to us or from the data we collect from customers through our Offerings. We use the information we collect about adversaries to help all of our customers and the public – DETECT, RESPOND, REVEAL. However, when we share information that we learn about adversaries, we don’t identify customers or individuals, other than, of course, the adversary, that’s the WHO, WHAT, and WHY of our security mission.

To the extent CrowdStrike collects personal information through its Offerings, CrowdStrike generally collects that information under the authority and direction of its customers, which often are corporate entities. CrowdStrike typically has no direct relationship or contact with an individual whose personal information we may collect or receive from a corporate customer and subsequently analyze and use. Consequently, any inquiries about the specific processing of your personal information via CrowdStrike Offerings should be directed to your organization. Regardless, the use of the information collected through our Offerings is limited to the purpose of providing the service for which our customers have engaged CrowdStrike or as otherwise outlined in our agreements. We do not use any personal information collected through our Offerings to contact or market products or services to these individuals. We also do not provide any personal information obtained through the Offerings to third parties for the purpose of contacting or marketing products or services to these individuals.

If you are a user of one of our Offerings, we obtain the personal information you provide us during the sales and/or fulfillment process. We may use personal information collected such as your name, phone number, mailing address, and email address to contact you and to provide and inform you of Offerings, send you an invoice, determine how our offerings are used and enhance customer success, perform accounting, auditing and collection activities, answer questions, and provide support or other similar services.

## 6\. How We Protect Your Information

The security of customer data and your personal information is not only important to us, it is our mission. We adopt data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of customer data and your personal information. We follow generally accepted practices to protect customer data and the personal information collected and submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. If you have questions about the security of your personal information collected through our Offerings or Websites, you can contact us at [privacy@crowdstrike.com](mailto:privacy@crowdstrike.com).
