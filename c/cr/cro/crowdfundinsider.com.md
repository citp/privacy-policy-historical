### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, CrowdfundInsider collects non-personally- identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers ￼typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. CrowdfundInsider’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how CrowdfundInsider’s visitors use its website. From time to time, CrowdfundInsider may release non- personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

CrowdfundInsider also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our sites. CrowdfundInsider only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to CrowdfundInsider’s websites choose to interact with CrowdfundInsider in ways that require CrowdfundInsider to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that CrowdfundInsider gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at CrowdfundInsider to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with CrowdfundInsider – by purchasing access to the Akismet comment spam prevention service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, CrowdfundInsider collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with CrowdfundInsider. CrowdfundInsider does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, ￼with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

If you are a registered user of an CrowdfundInsider website and have supplied your email address, CrowdfundInsider may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with CrowdfundInsider and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
