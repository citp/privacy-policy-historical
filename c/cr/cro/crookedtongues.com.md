# Privacy Policy

## Serious Stuff

Crooked Tongues Ltd. collects information from its users at different points of the website:

## Registration

In order to access the full Community side of the site, users must register first. This involves the individual to undertake the registration process whereby they are asked to determine the following information:

**Username and Password:** This information is needed such that the member can be differentiated from non-members and consequently can benefit from the Community section.

**Email Address:** This is needed such that we can confirm membership and also have a point of contact for necessary communications.

## Use of Information

In addition to the above uses of information, Crooked Tongues Ltd also utilises information acquired via its website to help understand how the site/services are used thus allowing it to identify possible improvements etc.

Various statistics and information relating to the site such as ‘average time spent on site’ etc are collected on a regular basis and these may occasionally be communicated to selected business partners. In such an event, it should be noted that the information is presented in an 'aggregate' format whereby no personal customer information is presented thus preventing individual customer identification. In short, Crooked Tongues Ltd will never provide your personal customer information to any outside parties, without your prior, confirmed consent, except to third party service providers engaged by us to help operate our business effectively.

Finally, we do not collect any personal data that is deemed as ‘sensitive’ e.g. medical condition; racial or ethnic origin; political origins; religious or philosophical beliefs or sexual preferences. Similarly, we do not also collect information from children – current legislation determines that individuals under the age of 13 cannot register with our site.

## Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. The Crooked Tongues Ltd. website employs ‘session cookies’ whereby once the user closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates.

Cookies are used within our site as they enable us to recognise you as a registered member thus allowing ‘member only’ sections to be made available. They also enable us to track and target the interests of our members to enhance the experience on our site.

With the exception of the online shop, to avoid the cookies system being used, do not log in as a member. In doing this, however, you will have limited privileges to the site e.g. you will not be able to access the news section etc.

## Information Sharing

We will never share, sell or rent individual personal information to any third parties without your permission or unless ordered by a court of law.

We do, from time to time, share aggregate information with selected business partners. As explained, this data does not contain personally identifiable information and instead serves to provide general information e.g. effectiveness of the various elements of the site.

## Information We Collect

In operating our website we may collect and process the following data about you:

Details of your visits to our website and the resources that you access, including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data.

Information that you provide by filling in forms on our website, such as when you registered for information or make a purchase.

## Images

Occasionally we'll use images from 'Today I Am' and submitted content for our online and print press. When pieces are uploaded to the 'Today I Am' sections, they become part of the site.

## Survey and Contents

From time to time, our site may run surveys or contests that invariably request certain pieces of information. Participation in these is completely voluntary and the member therefore has a choice of whether they wish to disclose the information. Requested information typically includes contact information (in the case of competitions) or other ‘personal’ information such as favourite sneakers etc (in the case of customer surveys).

Contact information will be solely used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring and improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users’ personally identifiable information is not shared with outside parties unless we give prior notice and gain permission from you.

## Online Security

Crooked Tongues Ltd. appreciates that ‘privacy’ and ‘security’ are processes that should be implemented rather than be used as buzzwords. We take this issue very seriously and have a series of online and offline measures to help ensure that our policies are adhered to.

From an online perspective, when we ask for sensitive information (such as credit card details), this data is always encrypted and protected using 256 bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.

From an offline perspective, all customer information is held within a secure customer database that is, again, protected by encryption and security technology; the servers are also protected by physical security measures. Finally, all our employees are kept up to date with our privacy policies and anyone who violates these procedures will be subject to our internal disciplinary procedures.

## Access to Personal Data

Registered members are in control of their personal data via their personal profile. The personal profile is only accessible by the relevant member and is password protected.

If you wish to unregister from www.crookedtongues.com, simply click on the appropriate button via your account. Once an account has become inactive, you must re-register to again become a member. Finally, please contact our privacy team to deactivate your personal data from our records.

## Privacy Policy Updates

If any changes are made to our privacy practices, in order to ensure that our members are aware of them, we will update our privacy policy within the site and also post notification of these changes in other places where we deem are appropriate.

## Contact

If you have any questions, concerns or suggestions about our privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at [support@crookedtongues.com](mailto:support@crookedtongues.com).
