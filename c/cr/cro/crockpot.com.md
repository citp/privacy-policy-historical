We may use your personal information to contact you regarding your comments or requests for information, to help process an order you have placed through our Website and to deliver information that is targeted to your interests.

Partner Companies: Some THG services are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide these services to you, it is necessary for us to share information with our partner company. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than our partner companies, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. 

Aggregate and Statistical Information: We collect non-personal information (such as your web browser, operating system, sites visited, etc.) about our customers, and aggregate this statistical information in order to identify well-liked attributes and tailor the design of our Website to meet the consumers needs. When we say that we may share such information in "aggregate" form, we mean that we will not disclose individual names, addresses, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses unless we have your permission. External companies may be provided aggregate information about our customers.
