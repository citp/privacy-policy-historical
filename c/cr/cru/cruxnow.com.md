### **Data breach prevention**

In the unlikely event of a breach where your stored data is, or may have been compromised, we will inform you within 24 hours after becoming aware of the data breach, and provide you with our action(s) taken in order to protect your data moving forward.

However, once the data has been submitted and is stored in our infrastructure, we ensure that the data is responsibly held and secured.
