# Privacy Policy

####  **Your Data, Privacy and Cookies**

We know that you are concerned with how your personal and financial information is dealt with. This privacy policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you (or that you provide to us) will be processed and demonstrates our commitment to your privacy.

By visiting our website and using our services you are accepting our policies and practices.

Capitalised terms in this document shall have the same meaning as those used in our Primary Terms of Service unless stipulated otherwise.

We may change the content or services found on our website at any time without notice, and consequently our privacy policy may change at any time in the future. You agree to revisit this page regularly and your continued access to, or use of, our website and your Crunch Account will mean that you agree to the changes.

We confirm that we will comply with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 when processing personal data about you and your business. For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 ('the Act') that data controller is E-Crunch Ltd of Unit 11, Hove Business Centre, Fonthill Road, Hove, East Sussex, BN3 6HA.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy, please contact us.

####  **Personal Information We Collect From You and How We Use It**

When completing a form on our website, when signing up for a Crunch Account, or at times during the course of your subscription with Crunch we ask you to provide information about your business, or the business you intend to form, along with any previous trading information. We may also request other personal details such as your marital status, date of birth, National Insurance No., telephone number, etc.

Information is collected and sent via online forms/surveys, email, over the phone, SMS text message or by post.

Any data entered via online forms/surveys, or directly into your Crunch Account is protected with SSL Encryption Certificates (secure socket layer technology) issued by leading certificate authorities Verisign or Go Daddy. This ensures all data transferred between users and our systems is encrypted. When sending emails we use TLS (Transport Layer Security) to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.

However, the Internet is not in itself a secure environment. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, users should only enter, or import data within a secure environment. This means that your browser must support the encryption security used in connection with our service. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

The information you provide allows us to:

  * electronically verify your identity in order to comply with UK anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist funding regulations;
  * ensure your Crunch Account is configured correctly;
  * carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us and to provide the services you have engaged us to undertake for you;
  * offer specific support and guidance;
  * provide further services;
  * notify you about changes to our services;
  * electronically contact you with information regarding Crunch’s promotions;
  * electronically contact you with news of Crunch’s business activities;
  * we may regularly contact you electronically with Crunch’s business advice content;
  * if you have provided us with your phone number then we may call you to ascertain your interest or not in becoming a crunch client;



The information we collect about you allows us to: 

  * make suggestions and recommendations to you about other goods or services that may interest you
  * administer our site and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes
  * improve our site to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer



By providing your personal data, you agree to the transfer, storing and, or processing of it. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password, which enables you to access certain parts of your Crunch Account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

By using the Services, you agree that Crunch can access, aggregate and use non-personally identifiable data we collect from you. This data will in no way identify you or any other individual. Crunch may use such aggregated non-personally identifiable data to:

  * assist us to better understand how our customers are using the Services
  * provide our customers with further information regarding the uses and benefits of the Services
  * enhance small business productivity, including by creating useful business insights from that aggregated data and allowing you to benchmark your business' performance against that aggregated data, and
  * otherwise to improve or augment the Services.



####  **Third Party Personal Data You Provide**

Through your use of the Services we may also collect information from you about someone else. If you provide Crunch with personal information about someone else, you must ensure that you are authorised to disclose that information to Crunch and that, without Crunch taking any further steps required by applicable data protection or privacy laws, Crunch may collect, use and disclose such information for the purposes described in this Policy.

You must therefore take reasonable steps to ensure the individual concerned is aware of and consents to the various matters detailed in this Policy, including the fact that their personal information is being collected, the purposes for which that information is being collected, the intended recipients of that information, the individual's right to obtain (and details of how to) access the information.

Where requested to do so, you must assist Crunch with any requests by the individual to access or update the personal information you have collected from them and provided to Crunch in connection with the Services.

####  **Where We Store Your Personal Data**

**All your data is held either within your Crunch Account, our CRM system, or on secure servers.**

If you sign up to the Snap Service your data may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff, operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

We maintain strict security standards and procedures with a view to preventing unauthorised access to your data by anyone, including our staff. We use leading technologies such as (but not limited to) data encryption, firewalls, server authentication, user profiles and passwords to protect the security of your data.

####  **Data Within Your Crunch Account**

You are ultimately responsible for administering and safeguarding any passwords or memorable words created to control access to your Crunch Account. You should be careful to log out of your account after you have finished any given session, especially if you are on a public computer.

Crunch accountants do not have editing access to your Crunch Account without your authentication and permission, save that our accountants will access your account to make necessary adjustments and Crunch staff will have full access to your Crunch Account with your authority to undertake the Bookkeeping Service. This access would be sought in exceptional circumstances and would not involve you having to reveal any of your login details. Crunch accountants do have access to make adjustments in the back end ledgers of your Crunch Account.

Read only access to your Crunch Account is available to specific staff members and is strictly controlled by passwords and IP address restrictions. The use of this access is for assisting with the use of your Crunch Account, and offering support when necessary.

####  **Bank Account and Transaction Information**

You will be required to provide information about your business bank account(s) such as the sort-code and account number in order to use your Crunch Account.

####  **Disclosure Of Your Information**

In order to carry out the Services of this engagement and for related purposes such as updating and enhancing our client records, analysis for management purposes and statutory returns, legal and regulatory compliance and crime prevention we may obtain, process, use and disclose personal data about you.

We also have a duty under section 330 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to report to the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) if we know, or have reasonable cause to suspect, that you or anyone connected with your business are or have been involved in money laundering. Failure on our part to make a report where we have knowledge, or reasonable grounds for suspicion, would constitute a criminal offence.

To the extent that we are duty bound by any applicable legal or regulatory requirement to cooperate with any competent legal or governmental authority or agency we shall do so in accordance with applicable law. Without limitation, we expressly reserve the right to cooperate with any competent authority, in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities of our website users or relating to our website users. We will have no legal liability for such disclosures of your information.

We may share the information we hold about you with any person, business or other organisation (and their advisers) who might take over our rights or responsibilities under our agreement with you to allow them to prepare for taking these over (after that, we may also allow that person or business to use and share your information on the same basis as us).

####  **Third Parties**

Crunch works with third parties to research certain usage and activities on our behalf. No personal information about you is shared, however in the course of conducting this research these third parties may place a unique 'cookie' on your browser.

Your Crunch Account may contain links enabling the electronic transfer of data with third-party applications. Crunch takes no responsibility for the privacy practices or content of these applications.

Our sites may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

Crunch has a number of partners who provide complementary services. If you express interest in a third party service by completing a form on our website, or by enabling usage of a third party service in the Crunch Connect section of your Crunch Account, your information will be passed to the relevant service provider. When in conversation with a Crunch team member, if you specifically express interest in a third party service and give your consent, we will also pass your contact information to the relevant service provider. These third parties may then send communications to you and provide information on offers and services that may be of interest to you. If at any time you wish to opt out of further communications, please follow the instructions in their marketing communications, or consult their privacy policies for further information about unsubscribing. These third parties will have their own privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies carefully prior to activating a service.

Crunch will never pass your personal information to a third party without your explicit and specific expression of interest in their services.

####  **Telephone, Texts, Call Monitoring and Recording**

Sometimes outgoing and incoming telephone calls from and to our advisory or support teams are recorded for training and monitoring purposes. This process helps us to maintain high standards of service, and resolve any issues.

To maintain the platform we may contact you by telephone or SMS text message to update you or let you know about any of our products, services or promotions (which, in some cases may be provided by third parties) but only according to the permissions you give us.

If you have consented to receive communication or marketing from us by SMS text message, to stop this, please email STOP to [dp@crunch.co.uk](mailto:dp@crunch.co.uk)

####  **Cookies**

Our public website and Services, along with most other major websites, use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to the cookie file on your computer's hard disk. Cookies enable users to navigate around the website and (where appropriate) enable us to tailor the content to fit the needs of visitors who have accessed the site.

By visiting the Crunch website, logging into or using our Services you agree that you are happy for us to set cookies. If you are not happy you should either not use our websites, or can disable the cookies.

We use two types of cookie on our website.

  * Session cookies, which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your computer until you close your browser at which point they are deleted.
  * Persistent, or stored cookies that remain permanently in the cookie file of your computer.



Cookies cannot look into your computer and obtain information about you or your family or read any material kept on your hard drive and, unless you have logged into your Crunch Account, cookies cannot be used to identify who you are.

Cookies cannot be used by anyone else who has access to the computer to find out anything about you, other than the fact that someone using the computer has visited a certain website. Cookies do not in any way compromise the security of your Crunch Account.

Cookies will not be used to contact you for marketing purposes other than by means of advertisements offered within our Services.

The web browsers of most computers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your web browser to disable cookies or to inform you when a website is attempting to add a cookie. You can also delete cookies that have previously been added to your computer's cookie file.

You can set your browser to disable persistent cookies and/or session cookies but if you disable session cookies, although you will be able to view our public unsecured website, you will not be able to log onto your Crunch Account.

For more information about cookies (including how to set browsers to reject cookies) please visit the website set up by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (Europe) at [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ "Find out more about browser cookies").

Cookies are used for a number of reasons on the Crunch website, and with our Services.

First party cookies are created by Crunch whilst third party cookies are created by affiliates or tracking services.

Google AnalyticsTM\- a third party tracking service collects information about how our website is used. We use information to report on usage and volume statistics. We have no access to or control over these cookies.

Information about Google AnalyticsTM can be found at [http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html](http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html).

Google Adwords - a third party advertising system that tells us tell a user arrived on our site by clicking on a paid advert. Cookies originating from Adwords also give us power to serve ads on the Google network specifically to people who have already visited our site and not signed up.

You can also opt-out of a number of targeted advertising cookies by visiting these opt-out pages: [National Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and [Google](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/?hl=en). This opt-out won't stop advertising companies from showing you banner ads, but it will prevent them from personalising their banner ads to you specifically.

Live Agent - a third party system used to provide the live chat facility on our website.

Visual Website Optimizer - From time to time we like to run tests on our site with a view to improving the user experience. VWO is a suite of testing tools that track a user's activity in a very particular way for the purpose of a test. This may be checking how far a group of users scroll down a page, splitting users into groups to view similar but different pages and so on.

Facebook – a third party social media platform that also supports its own advertising network. Cookies originating from Facebook also give us power to serve ads on the Facebook network specifically to people who have already visited our site and not signed up, as well as users determined by Facebook to be similar to our site’s visitors.

Infinity - a third party service used to deliver unique phone numbers to visitors, which enables on line activity to be associated with any phone calls made.

####  **Social Links**

On our website we use links to 'social sites' - Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and others.

When you click on these links these sites are likely to be collecting information about what you are doing all around the internet by setting one or more of their own cookies.

In some cases these sites will be registering the fact that you are visiting Crunch and the specific pages you are on, even if you don't click on the link if you are logged into their services, like Google and Facebook.

Crunch is not responsible for the data generated by or processed by such third parties. Therefore, you should check the respective policies of each of these sites to see how exactly they use your information and to find out how to opt-out, or delete, such information.

####  **Your Rights**

You may always opt not to disclose certain personal information, but that may mean we will be hindered in our ability to provide a service, or may mean you will not be able to access certain services, or parts of your Crunch Account.

After you have signed up for a Crunch Account and during your subscription you will receive service related emails from us, which are necessary to enable us to provide the Services. You will always have the ability to opt-out of receiving non-service related messages.

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.

You can also ask to opt-out of having personal identifiable information used for certain purposes, including promotional communications, newsletters etc.

You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by following the opt-out instructions, which will be clear and obvious on the forms, or emails we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at [dp@crunch.co.uk](mailto:dp@crunch.co.uk).

You can find detailed information about your rights under UK Data Protection legislation on the UK Information Commissioner's website at www.ico.gov.uk.
