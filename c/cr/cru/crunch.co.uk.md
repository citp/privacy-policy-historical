To provide this 'interest-based advertising', the parties combine non-personal data about your online activities acquired over time which helps cater advertising that we deliver to you. 

Examples of this may include a Crunch advertisement on a Facebook page, or a Google-owned page such as a search results page or YouTube, or on a site within Google's advertising network. We do not share your data as part of this process.

If you have opted out of receiving communications from us, we will not use your email for interest-based advertising, although you may still be subject to certain interest based advertising depending upon your browser and device settings.

##  **Where we store and process data**

By submitting your personal data, you agree to its transfer, storing and processing. 

Most personal data is stored electronically on servers or computer systems with controlled access and controlled environments.

Crunch servers are located within enterprise-grade hosting facilities that employ robust physical security controls to prevent physical access to the servers they house. These controls include monitoring, 24/7 surveillance and on-site security staff.

Other personal data may be kept in paper form within our office, if needed, although in the main copies are destroyed after they have been scanned into computer systems.

We will not transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) without complying with the provisions of the Data Protection Legislation in respect of such transfer. Where you access our services outside the EEA, it shall be your responsibility to ensure that any access outside of the EEA which results in a transfer of personal data complies with the provisions of the Data Protection Legislation.

However if you choose to access your personal data outside the EEA, you should only do so in a secure environment which means that your browser must support the encryption security used in connection with our services.

##  **How we secure your information**

Crunch is committed to protecting the security of your personal data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorised access, use or disclosure.

For example, any personal data transferred to us over the internet is protected with Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) Encryption Certificate technology. This ensures that all personal data transferred is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.

While no Service is completely secure, Crunch takes precautionary measures and has strict security standards to help prevent data loss, theft, misuse and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and destruction or other like incidents that might affect the security of your personal data.

These measures include encryption, password protection, anti-malware, firewalls, server authentication, user profiles, backup/disaster recovery systems, restriction of access to premises and computer systems, as well as use of relevant third party service providers to provide security.

Crunch imposes strict contractual obligations on its suppliers, subcontractors and partners to ensure data is secure, protected and treated in accordance with this Policy and we will take all steps reasonably necessary to maintain compliance with these obligations.

However we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data while it is being transmitted to us if you don’t enter or import it from a secure environment or secure mobile device.

Our services can be accessed through the use of an individual user login and password. To protect the confidentiality of data, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. Please alert us immediately if you believe your password has been misused. Additionally, always logout and close your browser when you finish your session, especially if you’re on a public computer. You are ultimately responsible for administering and safeguarding any passwords or memorable words created to control access. Please note, we will never ask you to disclose your password in an unsolicited phone call or email.

Crunch contracts with certain commercial banks to provide automated feeds of bank transaction data into our accounting software. These services provide an efficient method of transferring receipt and payment details directly from bank statements to your accounting records and the banks’ security protocols are applied to the transmissions. These services do not give Crunch or any third party the ability to transact via the relevant bank accounts.

If you have any questions about the security of your data, you can contact us at [dp@crunch.co.uk](mailto:dp@crunch.co.uk).

##  **Our retention of your information**

Crunch retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide our services or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly.

For example, the default standard retention period for accounting records is six years plus current, otherwise known as six years + one. This is defined as six years after the last entry in a record followed by first review and/or destruction to be carried out in the additional current (+ one) accounting year.

If Crunch needs to alter, restrict processing of your data, or remove your data we will inform you.
