Information you give us: Crutchfield collects any information which you enter on our Web site. This information is normally provided when you search, buy, participate in a contest, sweepstakes or on-line survey, or when you communicate with any of our departments such as customer service, sales or technical services through our Web site, telephone, mail or fax. You also provide information when you establish an account with us. Examples of the type of information you may supply us with include your name, address, telephone number, credit card information, e-mail addresses, and financial information such as your Social Security number.

Automatic Information collected by us: Whenever you visit our Web site we collect and store information such as "cookies" which remember information about a visitor from one page to the next and from one visit to the next. We collect and analyze the IP address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; password; computer and connection information such as your browser type and version; operating system and platform; purchase history; confirmation when you open e-mail that we send you; the URLs which lead you to and around our Web site including the date and time; the pages and or products you viewed or searched for and the phone number used to call our voice telephone numbers. Your browser allows you to reject cookies and software is available from third parties which will allow you to visit our Web site without providing this information. You are welcomed at our Web site if you use this software but we will not be able to offer you our personalized services.

Orders: If you place an order we use a secure order form which requires you to provide contact, billing, and financial information. This information is transmitted to your credit card company to authorize your purchase. At certain times we may offer financing options with or without third party participation. If you use a financing option information provided by you (such as your address, birth date, social security number, and credit card number) may be used to request a credit report from third parties or may be sent to a third party for processing.

Action Tags: Crutchfield's web pages may contain action tags set by third party firms for the purpose of collecting anonymous information about the usage of our site by customers. Action tags are also known as web beacons or 1 pixel gifs. Action tags are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our web site. They do not use personally identifiable information, such as names or addresses, and do not link online actions to an identifiable person.

## Sharing of Information with third-parties:

Affiliated Businesses and Crutchfield Corporation: We may share any information that you supply to us with any affiliated business that is substantially controlled by Crutchfield and Crutchfield Corporation. Any information that is shared this way will be subject to this Privacy Notice.

Independent Contractors: We may employ other companies or individuals to provide certain services to us such as sending e-mail, analyzing customer lists and data, providing marketing assistance, or consulting services. These third parties will have access to the information needed to perform their functions but cannot use that information for any other purpose.

DirecTV, XM Radio, SIRIUS, TiVo, MySony.com, Rainbow DBS Company LLC (Voom), and other third party service providers: Some of the products which we sell require us to provide your name, address, phone number and product serial number to the third party service provider that requires this information to activate the service. These third party service providers have their own privacy and data collection policies which are not controlled by Crutchfield. We have no responsibility or liability for these policies and urge you to contact the third party provider if you have any questions. We may occasionally partner with MySony.com in various email programs. If you link to Crutchfield.com from any MySony.com website and purchase a Sony product on Crutchfield.com we will forward a copy of your email address to MySony.com so that MySony.com can assure that you are awarded the correct points for your purchase and auto-register your purchase in the MySony.com product locker. Please note that MySony.com has its own privacy and data collection policies which are not controlled by Crutchfield.

Orders and Catalog Requests: When you place your order and/or when you request that we send you a catalog we may share your name and mailing address with a few carefully selected marketing partners. If you wish to opt out of sharing this information, please call 1-800-955-9091 or e-mail [service@crutchfield.com](mailto:service@crutchfield.com). We will never share any telephone number(s), or financial information which you have given us with any marketing partner(s).

Third Party Transaction-Level Data: If you visit our site from a third-party site the third-party site may be able to access your individual transaction information. In order to track and credit your transaction the third-party site may give you a unique code, cookie or graphic which will uniquely identify you. This will only happen if you link directly from a third party site to our Web site. Any transactions made at our Web site while such a code is active will be reported back to the third party site. We will only report non-personal information to these sites such as the date of the transaction, the product(s) purchased and the amount spent. We will not report any information to these third party sites that will allow them to personally identify you, however based on information which may have previously been collected from you by the third party site they may be able to personally identify you by combining the information they have gathered with the information sent by us. You should read the privacy policy posted by the third party site to see how they may use this information. The presence of a 3rd party navbar atop our site is an indication that the third party site may be able to see your activity on our site.
