However, your information may be accessible to authorities in accordance with applicable laws. 

We may also share aggregated or de-identified information about our customers with our advertising and marketing partners.

**CUSTOMER REVIEWS**

We use third party vendors to allow you to submit original reviews of our services. Original review content submitted by you to such third- party vendors' review submission forms and via email may also be published on third party websites. Personally identifying information is not required to submit reviews. Cruise America is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of such third parties.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18 and if we become aware of such collection, we will take reasonable steps to delete any such information as soon as practicable.

**USER-GENERATED CONTENT**

You may be able to disclose information about yourself in the course of contributing user-generated content on publicly-available areas of our services, such as Share Your Adventure or Photo Contest on cruiseamerica.com. Your Cruise America user profile and any information you post there will be publicly available. Your content may also be shared with users of other social media services to which you have chosen to share, consistent with your privacy settings on those services.

Any information you submit in the course of such activities can be read, collected, or used by other users. We cannot prevent you receiving unwanted messages from other users.

**LINKED SITES**

Our websites may contain links to other websites (such as those of our marketing partners), which may have privacy policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the activities and practices that take place on these websites. Accordingly, we recommend that you review the privacy policy posted on any website that you may access through our website.

**HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION**

  


The security of the information you provide is very important to us and we try to provide secure transmission of your information. For all transactions on all of our websites, we use Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to secure the transfer of information. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmission over the Internet. Once we receive your information, we take steps that we believe are reasonably appropriate to protect it, from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction to ensure the data's integrity. We use a combination of technological, physical, administrative and organizational controls as well as non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements as we deem appropriate to protect your data. Despite our best efforts, however, no security measures are completely impenetrable.

If you have a user name and password for any of the features on our websites, you have the responsibility of keeping your password secret. You should not reveal your password to anyone. We will not ask you in an unsolicited telephone call or email for your password. In addition, you should take reasonable precautions when using a computer that is not your own or in a public setting.

**GLOBAL DATA TRANSFERS AND PROCESSING**

  


We will use your information in the country in which your service and transaction occurs. Please be aware that, unless prohibited by law, your use or continued use of our websites and mobile applications signifies your express consent that information may be transferred to or stored on servers and processed outside the country of your residence, including any of the countries where we do business. Please also be aware that the privacy laws of the United States or other countries where information may be stored may not be as comprehensive or offer as much protection as the laws of other countries including your country of residence. You may request us not to make such transfers, but if you do, we may not be able to provide some, or all of our products or services to you.

With respect to personal data received or transferred, Cruise America is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Cruise America may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities.
