###  Crucial **Updates**

High Availability Cloud Hosting – What’s In Store for Next Year 16th December 2010

We have been hard at work this year to bring our customers a new level of high availability. Our order has placed with HP for a SAN and Blade setup, and should arrive in days.

**  
What does this mean?**

This means we will be able to provide a higher level of uptime on our entire product range. The new setup is designed with no single point of failure in mind across all aspects of the setup. This means if server goes offline or fails it will be automatically started on a new node with minimal downtime (seconds/minutes).  Unlike traditional SANs, the SAN we have selected (HP P4000 G2) allows for a single or multiple shelf failure without the SAN or volumes going down – this adds unprecedented reliability to the SAN.
