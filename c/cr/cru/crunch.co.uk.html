                        <p><span>We may share or disclose information with the following types of third parties.</span></p>

                        <p><span><strong>Suppliers:</strong> Crunch works with a variety of third party suppliers to perform services such as website hosting, online product purchases and email communications. We share your personal data as necessary to complete any transaction or provide a product or service you have requested. These suppliers work on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy. Crunch imposes strict contractual obligations on its suppliers to ensure data is secure, protected and treated in accordance with this Policy and we will take all steps reasonably necessary to maintain compliance with these obligations.</span></p>

                        <p><span><strong>Subcontractors:</strong> Crunch subcontracts elements of its service provision to other parties, for example Crunch Accounting Ltd. We will always ensure that we have appropriate contractual arrangements in place.</span></p>

                        <p><span><strong>Group companies:</strong> Crunch may share personal data with other members of our group this includes Crunch Umbrella Ltd, Crunch Investment &amp; Pensions Ltd, Crunch Academy Ltd or its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.</span></p>

                        <p><span><strong>Affiliates/Partners:</strong> Our sites may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks and affiliates who provide complementary services. Your information will only be passed to the relevant service provider if you express interest in a third party service by calling or completing a form on our website, or by enabling usage of a third party service, or by talking to a Crunch team member. These third parties may then send communications to you and provide information on offers and services that may be of interest to you. If, at any time, you wish to opt out of further communications, please follow the instructions in their marketing communications or consult their own privacy policies for further information about unsubscribing. Please note that some of our services e.g.: insurance, mortgages, investments and pensions and applications are provided by third parties whose privacy practices may differ from Crunch. If you provide personal data to any of those third parties, your data is governed by their privacy policy. Overall, we do not accept any liability arising from the operation of these third party privacy policies, so please check these policies carefully prior to activating a service.</span></p>

                        <p><span><strong>Legal/Regulatory Bodies:</strong> To the extent that we are duty bound by any applicable legal or regulatory requirement to cooperate with any competent legal or governmental authority or agency, we shall do so in accordance with applicable law. This may involve disclosure of your personal data and we will have no legal liability for such disclosures. Please note that, depending on circumstances, Crunch may be forbidden from advising you of the fact that your personal data has been disclosed to or requested by such third parties.</span></p>

                        <p><span>Under Section 330 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 we have a duty to report to the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) if we know, or have reasonable cause to suspect, that you or anyone connected with your business are or have been involved in money laundering. Failure on our part to make a report where we have knowledge, or reasonable grounds for suspicion, would constitute a criminal offence. We are obliged by law to undertake this reporting to SOCA, but are under no obligation to make you aware of this reporting. In fact, we may commit the criminal offence of "tipping off" under Section 333 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 if we were to inform you that a report had been made. In consequence, neither Crunch's principals nor staff may enter into any correspondence or discussions with you regarding such matters.</span></p>

                        <p><span>Other personal data may be kept in paper form within our office, if needed, although in the main copies are destroyed after they have been scanned into computer systems.</span></p>

                        <p><span>We will not transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) without complying with the provisions of the Data Protection Legislation in respect of such transfer. Where you access our services outside the EEA, it shall be your responsibility to ensure that any access outside of the EEA which results in a transfer of personal data complies with the provisions of the Data Protection Legislation.</span></p>

                        <p><span>However if you choose to access your personal data outside the EEA, you should only do so in a secure environment which means that your browser must support the encryption security used in connection with our services.</span></p>

                        <p><span>Crunch is committed to protecting the security of your personal data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorised access, use or disclosure.</span></p>

                        <p><span>For example, any personal data transferred to us over the internet is protected with Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) Encryption Certificate technology. This ensures that all personal data transferred is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.</span></p>

                        <p><span>While no Service is completely secure, Crunch takes precautionary measures and has strict security standards to help prevent data loss, theft, misuse and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and destruction or other like incidents that might affect the security of your personal data.</span></p>

                        <p><span>These measures include encryption, password protection, anti-malware, firewalls, server authentication, user profiles, backup/disaster recovery systems, restriction of access to premises and computer systems, as well as use of relevant third party service providers to provide security.</span></p>

                        <p><span>Crunch imposes strict contractual obligations on its suppliers, subcontractors and partners to ensure data is secure, protected and treated in accordance with this Policy and we will take all steps reasonably necessary to maintain compliance with these obligations.</span></p>

                        <p><span>However we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data while it is being transmitted to us if you don’t enter or import it from a secure environment or secure mobile device.</span></p>

                        <p><span>Our services can be accessed through the use of an individual user login and password. To protect the confidentiality of data, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. Please alert us immediately if you believe your password has been misused. Additionally, always logout and close your browser when you finish your session, especially if you’re on a public computer. You are ultimately responsible for administering and safeguarding any passwords or memorable words created to control access. Please note, we will never ask you to disclose your password in an unsolicited phone call or email.</span></p>

                        <p><span>Crunch contracts with certain commercial banks to provide automated feeds of bank transaction data into our accounting software. These services provide an efficient method of transferring receipt and payment details directly from bank statements to your accounting records and the banks’ security protocols are applied to the transmissions. These services do not give Crunch or any third party the ability to transact via the relevant bank accounts.</span></p>

                        <p><span>If you have any questions about the security of your data, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:dp@crunch.co.uk">dp@crunch.co.uk</a>.</span></p>

                        <p><span>Crunch retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide our services or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly.</span></p>

                        <p><span>For example, the default standard retention period for accounting records is six years plus current, otherwise known as six years + one. This is defined as six years after the last entry in a record followed by first review and/or destruction to be carried out in the additional current (+ one) accounting year.</span></p>
