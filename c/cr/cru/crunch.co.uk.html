							<p>
								<span>When completing a form on our website, when signing up for a Crunch Account, or at times during the course of your subscription with Crunch we ask you to provide information about your business, or the business you intend to form, along with any previous trading information.</span> <span>We may also request other personal details such as your marital status, date of birth, National Insurance No., telephone number, etc.</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								<span>Information is collected and sent via online forms/surveys, email, over the phone, SMS text message or by post.</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								<span>Any data entered via online forms/surveys, or directly into your Crunch Account is protected with SSL Encryption Certificates (secure socket layer technology) issued by leading certificate authorities Verisign or Go Daddy. This ensures all data transferred between users and our systems is encrypted. When sending emails we use TLS (Transport Layer Security) to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								<span>However, the Internet is not in itself a secure environment. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, users should only enter, or import data within a secure environment. This means that your browser must support the encryption security used in connection with our service. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</span>
