		<!-- ParseComments|A|INCLUDE|9864|CPINCMA_PrivacyPolicy_Body|1011129|--><p>At Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCCL), we are committed to protecting your
personal information that you share with us through the Internet.</p>
<p>This statement sets forth our privacy policy regarding information you
provide to us through the use of our Web site. This statement also provides you
with information on how to prevent your personal information from being
collected or shared when you visit our Web site, respond to our Web-based
promotions or send us an e-mail.</p>
<p><span class="shead-general">The Information We Gather</span><br>
We collect information about you through two principal means: through technology
(for example IP addresses and cookies) and through your voluntary submission of
information.</p>
<p><span class="shead-small">1. Non-personally Identifiable Information</span></p>
<p>Using technology, our sites can collect information about the type of browser
you are using, your operating system and your IP address information using
technology. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your
computer and is recognized by Web technology whenever you are surfing the
Internet. None of this information is considered personally identifiable
information. As technology evolves, additional methods of information gathering
may be used, such as "pixel tags" (also known as "web
beacons" and "clear gifs").</p>
<p>We also use cookies and other technologies to collect non-personally
identifiable information for a variety of purposes, such as to improve the
design and content of our website and to enable us to provide a more
personalized experience when you browse the Internet. Most industry-standard Web
browsers have an option that allows you to turn off all cookies or have your
computer inform you each time that a request to place a cookie is being made. If
you turn cookies off (or refuse to accept a request to place a cookie), you may
not have access to some features on our Web sites and some of our services, such
as purchasing a cruise or being automatically recognized as a loyalty member,
may not function properly.</p>
<p>We may provide aggregate non-personally identifiable information to third
parties (such as marketers, ad server companies and advertisers) that make use of general customer
data. We may also share that information with concessionaires aboard our vessels
and other third parties.</p>
<p>RCCL is not liable for information that is inaccurate due to technical
defects in software used on our web sites, whether induced by our systems or by
software provided by third parties.</p>
<p><span class="shead-small">2. Personally Identifiable Information</span></p>
<p>You can use the majority of our Web sites without being required to divulge
any personally identifiable information to us. To participate in or use some of
the activities available on our sites (such as purchasing a cruise, entering a
contest or contacting us) you may be required to provide certain personally
identifiable information (such as your name and e-mail address). In addition, in
connection with some activities such as purchasing a cruise, we collect
additional personally identifiable information such as your date of birth,
street and billing address, and credit card number.</p>
<p>When corresponding with you via e-mail, we may use a variety of technologies,
such as "clear gifs" or "web beacons", to let us know, among
other things, whether you received and opened our e-mail. The clear gif included
in the e-mail may establish a cookie on your system that further allows us to
tailor information to fit your personal interests.</p>
<p>RCCL will not trade, sell or share such personally identifiable information
for use by any third parties unless we have informed you, been authorized by you
or are required by law to do so. In addition, such personally identifiable
information shall not be disclosed to third parties unless we have informed you,
been authorized by you or are required by law to do so. The term "third
parties" does not include any subsidiaries or affiliates of RCCL, service
providers or vendors acting on RCCL's behalf or travel agents or the purchaser
of substantially all of the assets of RCCL or a subsidiary or affiliate of RCCL.
Our policy is to require that third parties keep that information confidential.
We reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable information, without
notice, if we believe that such action is necessary to defend and protect the
rights or property of RCCL and its family of Web sites or to protect the
personal safety of users of RCCL, its Web sites or the public.</p>
<p>Your credit card number is used to process your request for products or
services and will not be shared with third parties that are not involved with
the transaction.</p>
<p><span class="shead-general">How We Use The Information Gathered.</span><br>
We use the information that you share with us for these purposes:
</p><ul>
  <li>To provide the products, services or membership benefits you request;
  </li><li>To improve the content of our site and enhance your cruise planning
    experience;
  </li><li>To ensure proper billing;
  </li><li>To measure consumer demand or interest in various offerings; and
  </li><li>For marketing and promotional purposes, including to provide you with
    information about products and services offered by Royal Caribbean and its
    subsidiaries and affiliates.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="shead-general">How Do I tell Royal Caribbean That I Don't Want
To Be Contacted or Change My Personally Identifiable Information?</span><br>
Our Web sites sometimes provide you the opportunity to opt-in to receive
communications from us at the point where we request information from you. You
always have the option of removing your name from our e-mail mailing list(s) so
that you will not receive further e-mail promotional communications from us. In
order to ensure immediate removal from any list, it is best to follow the
specific instructions outlined within the communications you receive from us
since we operate numerous sites and e-mail lists. If you are unable to complete
the process indicated in such communications, <a href="mailto:emd@rccl.com">send
us an e-mail.</a></p>
<p><span class="shead-general">Links and Third Parties</span><br>
Our Web sites often provide links to resources that we believe may be useful.
These links will lead you to Web sites operated by third parties that operate
under different privacy policies. We encourage you to review those privacy
policies, as we have no control over information you may submit to those third
parties.</p>
<p>Our web sites may use third parties, such as ad server companies, to present
or serve advertisements that you may see on our web site. Our web sites may also
include advertisements placed by third parties. Our privacy policy does not
cover any information collected by those third parties nor does it cover how
they may use such information.</p>
<p><span class="shead-general">How Do We Protect Your Information?</span><br>
Security for all personally identifiable information is extremely important to
us. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the
correct usage of information, we monitor and adjust our physical, electronic and
managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that data transmitted over the Internet
will always be secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally
identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
information you transmit to us or from our online products and services, and you
do so at your own risk. Upon receipt of your transmission, we strive to ensure
the security of that information in our systems.</p>
<p><span class="shead-general">What About Children Under The Age of 13?</span><br>
None of our Web sites are targeted at children (minors under 13 years of age),
and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
children who have not obtained parental consent.</p>
<p><span class="shead-general">Privacy Policy Updates</span><br>
By using our Web sites, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. RCCL
reserves the right to modify, alter or otherwise update this policy at any time.
Visitors are encouraged to review this policy from time to time to stay abreast
of any changes. Your continued use of our Web sites following the posting of any
changes to this policy means you accept those changes.</p>
<p><span class="shead-general">Questions or Comments?</span><br>
If you have any further questions or comments regarding our Privacy Policy,
please <a href="mailto:emd@rccl.com">send us an e-mail</a> with your questions
or comments.</p>
