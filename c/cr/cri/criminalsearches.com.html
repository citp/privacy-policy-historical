            <p>This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to the
                CriminalSearches.com web site (the “Site”). We understand
                and respect your concerns about privacy and the security of personal
                information, and we want you to feel comfortable using our Site.
                Maintaining the security of your personally identifiable information
                is important to us, as is giving you choices as to how that information
                is used and shared. We've created this Policy to provide you
                with information about data security and the privacy practices
                and policies applicable to the Site.</p>

              <h3><strong>Types of Information We Collect</strong></h3>
              <p>The Site may collect general information, which refers to data
                that is generally not tied back to a specific individual. Unlike
                general information, personally identifiable information refers
                to data that tells us specifically who you are, such as your
                name and email address, which may be collected in addition to
                the general data described above as provided below.</p>

              <p>The general information we collect (either directly or through
                the use of a third-party tracking system) includes:</p>

              <ul class="fixed">
                <li>The IP address of the computer making the request (usually
                  this is not your personal computer, but a computer used by
                  your internet service provider or company network) </li>
                <li>The URL that is being requested </li>
                <li>The date and time of the request </li>
                <li>The browser type and operating system used to make the request </li>
                <li>The referring URL </li>
              </ul>
 
              <br>  

              <p>We also may collect aggregate search terms from search engine
                referrals to determine what information visitors are searching
                for when they find our Site. All of this general information
                is used to administer and improve our Site and diagnose any technical
                problems which may occur with our servers.</p>

              <p>You have the option of creating an account with us in order
                to receive certain email (“Account”). In the event
                you create an Account, the Site may collect personal information
                by email or via our contact forms. Unless you give your consent,
                this information will not be shared with third parties for their
                marketing purposes.&nbsp; </p>

              <h3><strong>Disclosing Your Information</strong></h3>
              <p>In general, we will not share your email address with any third
                party. However, if you specifically authorize us to provide your
                email address to a third party, we may do so in accordance with
                your instructions. We do not share any of your personally identifiable
                information with unrelated third parties for their own marketing
                purposes without your consent. However, we may disclose any of
                the information we collect to companies that perform marketing
                services on our behalf and companies that are related to us by
                common ownership or affiliated with us by common control. </p>

              <p>If we are acquired by or merge with another company, information
                will be transferred to the acquiring company. We may also share
                information to the extent we believe it is necessary to comply
                with the law (e.g., in response to subpoenas or government investigations),
                to assert or defend legal claims, and in order to investigate
                or respond to actual or suspected illegal activities, fraud,
                and threats of physical harm.</p>

              <h3><strong>Your Right to Choose</strong></h3>
              <p>You have the ability to opt-out of certain types of information
                sharing and communications. You may opt-out of certain communications
                if you prefer that we not send you newsletters or other communications.
                If you exercise this opt-out right, we will not send you any
                further newsletters or other communications. If you receive an
                email from us you may exercise your right to opt-out of further
                email communications by following the opt-out link contained
                in our email.</p>

              <h3><strong>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors</strong></h3>
              <p>If our Site contains links to other sites, we are not responsible
                for the privacy practices or content of those other sites. We
                sometimes may offer content (e.g., promotions) that is sponsored
                by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of
                these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally
                identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to
                participate in the site activity. We have no control over these
                third parties' use of this information. We will notify you at
                the time of requesting personally identifiable information if
                we will be providing this information to third parties.</p>

              <h3><strong>Cookies</strong></h3>
              <p>A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by
                a Web server and stored by the user's Web browser so the information
                can later be read back from that browser. Cookies enable the
                browser to identify itself to the server, and allow the server
                to maintain an active "session" with an individual
                user. Cookies help the browser remember some specific information.
                We make limited use of cookies to make your visit to the Site
                easier, to improve the user experience and to identify individual
                users who have an Account with us. We also use a third-party
                tracking service that uses cookies to gather statistical information
                about how our Site is used. This statistical information is not
                connected to any of your personal information.</p>

              <h3><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></h3>
              <p>The Site and the Products are intended for use only by adults.
                We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information
                from children.</p>

              <h3><strong>Changes to our Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
              <p>We want you to be fully informed about how we will use your
                information and protect your privacy. We may change this Privacy
                Policy in the future. You agree that we may notify you of changes
                in our Privacy Policy by posting a new or updated policy on the
                Site. You should periodically check this Privacy Policy for changes.
                Changes will take effect immediately upon posting on the Site.
                Your continued use of our Site following the posting of changes
                to this Policy will mean you accept those changes.</p>

              <h3><strong>Notices</strong></h3>
              <p>We may send certain legally required notices or disclosures,
                including notices regarding our privacy policies, to you via
                email, and you consent to receiving any such consents or disclosures
                via email. It will be your responsibility to ensure that you
                have the necessary systems to allow you to receive email notices
                and disclosures from us.</p>

              <h3><strong>Scope of Policy</strong></h3>
              <p>This Privacy Policy applies to individuals using the Site for
                personal, family or household purposes, unless a different privacy
                policy is provided for by us. <strong></strong></p>

                The data on this site provides only public record information and is intended
                for your personal use only. Our data should not be relied upon to determine an
                individual's actual criminal record since the offense listed is sometimes
                generic and could represent several different charges. Assumptions should NOT
                be made solely on the offense displayed on this web site. Our data includes
                more than criminal records, such as civil filings and traffic and other minor
                offenses, so people listed may not be actual criminals. Also, not all criminal
                records result in conviction, nor do they all provide dispositions of guilt or
                innocence. Expunged or sealed records will be removed from the site once we
                receive notice of the same from you. In order to provide you the most
                comprehensive search experience, from time to time we may buy data from private
                data providers. Charging decisions made by the State Attorney's Office or from
                the outcome of criminal trials should be obtained from the source.
