<h4>CRITTERCISM, INC. PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p>Crittercism, Inc. takes your privacy seriously. We recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy describes the collection of your personal information by Crittercism from our website located at http://www.crittercism.com, including without limitation all sub-domains thereof on which this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively, the “Site”). This Privacy Policy also describes our use and disclosure of such information. By accessing or using our Site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into theÂ <a href="https://www.crittercism.com/tos-v3.html">Crittercism Terms of Service</a>Â and subject to the provisions of the Crittercism Terms of Service. The terms “Crittercism,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Crittercism, Inc. The terms “you” and “your” refer to the user accessing or using the Site.</p>
<p>The term “personal information” as used in this Privacy Policy refers to personally identifiable information that specifically identifies an individual (such as an individual’s first and last name, address, telephone number, e- mail address, credit card or other account number), and information about that individual or such individual’s activities or preferences when such information is directly linked to personally identifying information. Personal information does not include “aggregate information” or other non-personally identifiable information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed. We may collect, use and disclose aggregate information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes.</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Via Registration, Site Products and Site Services:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you register for an account on the Site or otherwise register to access or use any Crittercism products or services available through the Site, the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information through such registration, access and use is further described in and governed by the Crittercism Terms of Service located at [insert link to Terms of Service].</p></blockquote>
<p>Via Correspondence:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you contact us by e-mail, using a chat box or contact form on the Site, or by mail, fax, or other means, we collect the personal information contained within, and associated with, your correspondence.</p></blockquote>
<p>Via E-mail Newsletters:</p>
<blockquote><p>We may offer e-mail newsletters from time to time on the Service, if you sign up to receive a newsletter from us, we collect your e-mail address.</p></blockquote>
<p>Via User Profiles:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Service may give you the ability to create and update a user profile on the Service. If we offer user profile functionality on the Service, we will collect the personal information that you provide to use in the course of creating or updating a user profile. This information may include, for example, name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, and related demographic information about you. We may indicate that some personal information is required to create the profile, while some is optional.</p></blockquote>
<p>Via Interactive Site Features and Public Site Areas:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Site may contain interactive functionality that allows you to engage with other users on the Site, to post comments to forums, to upload content (“User Materials”), to participate in surveys via the Site or e-mail, and otherwise to interact with the Site and with other users. If you use any interactive functionality on the Site that requests or permits you to provide us with personal information (including, for example, any features that allow you to post user materials on any of our services), we collect the personal information that you provide to us in the course of using these interactive features.</p></blockquote>
<p>Via Contests and Sweepstakes:</p>
<blockquote><p>We or our advertisers and other business partners may conduct or sponsor special contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions that users may enter or otherwise participate in on the Service. Certain of these promotions may be co-branded with one of our advertisers or other business partners. In these instances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the third-party partner on its website or other online service and may be shared with us. The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such personal information.</p></blockquote>
<p>Via Passive Means Through the Site and Correspondence:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you visit our Site, some information is collected automatically. For example, when you access our Site, we automatically collect (a) your browser’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, (b) your browser type, (c) the nature of the device from which you are visiting the Site (e.g., a personal computer or a mobile device), (d) the identifier for any handheld or mobile device that you may be using, (e) the website that you visited immediately prior to accessing our Site, (f) the actions you take on our Site, and (g) the content, features, and activities that you access and participate in on our Site. We also may collect information regarding your interaction with e-mail messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>We may collect this information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies, and clear GIFs (also known as “web beacons”). We may use information passively-collected from the Site to administer, operate, and improve the Site and our other programs, services, products, websites and other systems, to improve the effectiveness of advertising on the Service, and to provide advertisements and other content and Site experience that is tailored to you. If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means from the Site with your personal information, or if applicable laws require us to treat any information gathered through passive means from the Site as personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, we use and disclose information collected by passive means from the Site in aggregate form or otherwise in a non-personally identifiable form.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Also, please be aware that third parties, such as companies displaying advertisements on the Service or sites, services and products provided by third parties (“Third-Party Sites”) that may be linked to or otherwise made available through or on the Site, may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means of passively collecting information about your use of their services, Third-Party Sites or content. We do not have access to, or control over, these third-party means of passive data collection.</p></blockquote>
<p>Via Other Sources:</p>
<blockquote><p>We may receive information about you, including personal information, from third parties (for example, Third-Party Sites that may provide chat box features on the Site), and we may combine this information with other personal information we maintain about you. If we do so, this Privacy Policy governs any combined information that we maintain in personally identifiable format.</p></blockquote>

<p>We use personal information (a) to provide programs, services, products and information that you request; (b) to enhance, improve, operate, and maintain our programs, services, products, websites, and other systems; (c) to prevent fraudulent use of our programs, services, products, websites, and other systems; (d) to prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in violation of our Terms of Use or applicable law; (e) to tailor advertisements, content, and other aspects of your experience on and in connection with the Site; (f) to maintain a record of our dealings with you; (g) for other administrative purposes; and (h) for any other purposes that we may disclose to you at the point at which we request your personal information, and pursuant to your consent.</p>

<p>Corporate Affiliates, Service Providers and Business Transfers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crittercism may disclose or transfer your personal information (a) to its corporate affiliates (for example, a subsidiary or parent corporation), (b) to its service providers (like fulfillment, hosting, or payment service providers), but only for their use to provide the requested service, or (c) to an acquirer, or successor or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which Personal Information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets. Crittercism requires its corporate affiliates that receive your personal information to limit their use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

To request removal of your personal information from these areas, please contact us. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p></blockquote>
