CRICKET AUSTRALIA PRIVACY POLICY (at 8 March 2006)

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This document sets out our policy on how we will manage your personal information.

Personal information is information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database) from which it is possible to determine your identity. Examples of personal information include your name, postal address, telephone number and email address.

We collect personal information about you in a number of ways, including:  
• directly from you, for example, when you provide information to us by phone, email, in an application form or through our web sites (including cricket.com.au and crichit.com.au); and  
• from third parties, such as the State and Territory cricket associations.

We and the State and Territory cricket associations to whom we disclose your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, may use your personal information in order to:  
• verify your identity;  
• develop, run, administer and market competitions, programs, activities and other events relating to cricket and other sports;  
• market products, services, merchandise and special offers made available by us or the State and Territory cricket associations or our respective corporate partners, licensees, suppliers and sponsors;  
• administer and manage our respective web sites and provide you with access to those web sites;  
• keep you informed of news and information (such as advance notice of ticket sales) relating to cricket and other sports, including by distributing newsletters, publications and other communication via various mediums;  
• research and develop new competitions, programs, activities and other events relating to cricket and other sports; and  
• research and develop new products, services and merchandise relating to cricket and other sports.  
If you do not wish to receive our newsletters, publications and other communications, please contact us (our contact details are set out below).

In some circumstances we may collect:  
• information about your health; or  
• other sensitive information about you (for example, information about your racial or ethnic origin).  
We may use health information about you to ensure that cricket programs in which you participate are run safely and in accordance with any special health needs you may have and for insurance purposes.  
In addition, we may use de-identified health information and other sensitive information to carry out research, to prepare submissions to government or a government body or to plan events and activities. De-identified information is information which has been aggregated or otherwise de-identified so that it cannot be used to identify you or any other individual.

We may disclose your personal information to:  
• the various State and Territory cricket associations;  
• organisations (other than the State and Territory cricket associations) involved in cricket and sporting programs and initiatives in Australia;  
• companies that we have engaged to carry out functions and activities on our behalf;  
• our professional advisers, including our accountants, auditors and lawyers;  
• our insurers;  
• the Australian Institute of Sport; and  
• otherwise as required or authorised by law.

We take all reasonable precautions to ensure that the personal information we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete and up-to-date. However, we rely on the accuracy of personal information as provided to us both directly and indirectly.  
If you find that the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date, please contact us immediately (our contact details are set out below) and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that it is corrected.

Subject to some exceptions provided by law, you have the right to access your personal information. For security purposes, if you would like to access personal information that we hold about you, we require you to put your request in writing. If we do not allow you access to any part of the personal information we hold about you, we will tell you why. We will not charge you for lodging a request to access your personal information, but we may charge you for our reasonable costs in supplying you with access to this information.
