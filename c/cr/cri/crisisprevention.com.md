We only provide those companies with the information that they need to provide us with such services, and we prohibit them from using that information for any other purpose.

Except as otherwise stated in this policy, the personal information you provide on this site will not be shared with any third parties, although CPI reserves the right to share such information with its affiliates and subsidiaries without your permission.
