# Privacy Policy | CPI

CPI respects and understands the importance of privacy and security for our online customers. Any information collected is used by CPI to run this site and to contact consumers for marketing and operational purposes. Persons who supply us with their telephone number, address, or email address online may receive telephone, mail, or email contact from us with information regarding special promotions, new products and services, upcoming events, or general promotional materials.

CPI sometimes hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as sending newsletters and performing statistical analysis with regard to the use of our website. We only provide those companies with the information that they need to provide us with such services, and we prohibit them from using that information for any other purpose.

Except as otherwise stated in this policy, the personal information you provide on this site will not be shared with any third parties, although CPI reserves the right to share such information with its affiliates and subsidiaries without your permission. In addition, CPI reserves the right to disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary.

**Learner Record Policy**  
Each learner training record will be restricted from public access. CPI utilizes a standardized and centralized record management system for filing and storing learner training information. This system will assure ease of retrieval, availability and accessibility of the learner training record without sacrificing the confidentiality of the leaner training information. All leaners will have the ability to obtain a copy of their learner record. Learners may request a copy of their record by completing and signing an authorization/disclosure of form. Contact customer service at 800.558.8976 for assistance.
