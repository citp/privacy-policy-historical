# Privacy policy

**What is this privacy policy?**

Criteo takes your privacy very seriously. This document’s purpose is to detail as clearly as possible the main principles of the Criteo technology and the data we collect, and so give you all the information you need to decide whether or not to continue to receive personalised banner advertisements.

**What does Criteo know about me?**

We do not know who you are. We do not know your name. We do not know where you live, where you work, your gender, your age, your email address or any other personally identifiable information about you. We do not collect any information from the publisher website on which you may have seen our ads. We do not store your IP address.  
We do know that the Internet Browser you are using has visited one of our partner sites (probably an online retailer) in the last 30 days, and we have seen which products you were interested in on that site.

**What is Criteo?**

Criteo is a specialist in creating personalised advertisements. We work with retailers to build advertisements for their customers. Our aim is to deliver more relevant advertisements, by trying to show products that you might be interested in based on your recent visit to the retailer’s site. Criteo display these products inside personalised banners that you may find while visiting websites that display advertising.

**What is the advantage of receiving ads built by Criteo?**

You should receive personalised ads that are more relevant for you than the standard advertising you would receive without Criteo. Our hope is that over time you will receive fewer annoying ads that aren’t relevant to you and which interrupt your online activities.

**What kind of data is collected?**

We only collect anonymous data. In order to identify which products you might be interested in, Criteo records which pages you have browsed on our partners’ website - normally an online retailer. Cookies keep the information of which pages you viewed, and in certain cases which products you bought. This data is anonymous and exclusively meant for statistical treatment. There is absolutely no way for Criteo to identify the visitor. Our advertisements do not combine information about you from multiple sources. We do not take any user information from a retailer that they may have stored about you (name, address, etc). We do not share any data with any site that displays our advertising.

**Data security**

We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of firewalls and encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**What are cookies?**

Cookies are small chunks of data created by a Web server, delivered through your Web browser, and stored on your computer. Cookies are used all the time on the Internet, for example so when you go back to a site you can continue to access your email or your shopping basket, without logging back in. These websites use a cookie to identify that it is you who has returned – rather like giving you a library card, and asking to see it when you come back.  
Cookies make the personalization of your Web experience possible. Without cookies, you would need to re-enter your information from scratch on each visit to that Web site. Criteo uses cookies to identify anonymously your web browser as unique. Any website you visit can store a cookie in your browser, as long as you have configured your web browser to authorize cookies.

**Where will I see advertisements powered by Criteo?**

Our retailers’ advertisements are displayed on many Internet sites (“Publishers”). In some cases, these Publishers may also place a cookie on your browser. This cookie is there so that the Publisher recognizes that Criteo has a personalised advertisement available for your browser. For example Google, as a third party vendor, uses a cookie (which they call a DART cookie) to identify users where Criteo has a personalised advertisement. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google [advertising privacy policies](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). To opt out of all Criteo personalised banners see below.

**How can I disable the display of Criteo personalised advertisements?**
