# Criticker - Privacy Policy

## Information Gathering

On registration, Criticker asks for your email address, name, age and gender. Your email address is the only field which is required information, because it is necessary in case your password is lost.

## Emails from Criticker

If you choose not to receive emails from Criticker about movie recommendations and new features, you will not receive any. Criticker may still send you emails when legally required to do so -- such as when there is a change to this privacy policy or information regarding your account.

## Cookies

Criticker.com may set and update cookies on your computer, which allow us to remember your username and preferences which you set. Criticker will not set cookies with the intent of marketing.
