# Criminal Searches - Privacy Policy

### **General**

This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to the CriminalSearches.com web site (the “Site”). We understand and respect your concerns about privacy and the security of personal information, and we want you to feel comfortable using our Site. Maintaining the security of your personally identifiable information is important to us, as is giving you choices as to how that information is used and shared. We've created this Policy to provide you with information about data security and the privacy practices and policies applicable to the Site. This Privacy Policy also applies to our offline collection of information. 

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Use (“Terms”). By clicking your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use during the registration process on the Site you are entering into a legally binding agreement with CriminalSearches.com based upon the terms of these policies. Each time that you access CriminalSearches.com Applications or our Services you signify that you agree to be bound by the Terms and this Privacy Policy, acknowledge that we are not providing you with a consumer report, and agree that you will not use the information obtained from us for any purpose covered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. §1681, et seq.). If you do not agree to the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the CriminalSearches.com Applications or Services. 

### **Types of Information We Collect**

The Site may collect general information, which refers to data that is generally not tied back to a specific individual. Unlike general information, personally identifiable information refers to data that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and email address, which may be collected in addition to the general data described above as provided below. 

The general information we collect (either directly or through the use of a third-party tracking system) includes:

  * The IP address of the computer making the request (usually this is not your personal computer, but a computer used by your internet service provider or company network) 
  * The URL that is being requested 
  * The date and time of the request 
  * The browser type and operating system used to make the request 
  * The referring URL 



We also may collect aggregate search terms from search engine referrals to determine what information visitors are searching for when they find our Site. All of this general information is used to administer and improve our Site and diagnose any technical problems which may occur with our servers. 

You have the option of creating an account with us in order to receive certain email (“Account”). In the event you create an Account, the Site may collect personal information by email or via our contact forms. Unless you give your consent, this information will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. 

**Registration Information.** We will collect personal information from you if you register with us or subscribe to our Services ("Personal Information"). Any information you provide before registering with us is not associated with you individually and is not retained by CriminalSearches.com unless you register with us. When you register you are required to provide certain categories of information, such as name, e-mail address, billing information and a password. 

**Searching for records.** When you are searching for records, you may enter third party personal information such as their name, address or phone. We only use the data you input to provide you with a search request. We retain the results of your search requests for a period of time at our discretion but do not use that information for any other purpose and have no obligation to maintain such search results. 

**Optional Information.** At various other points during your visit to CriminalSearches.com, you may be asked to provide information about yourself. The use of other services which require the input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part. You have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of our CriminalSearches.com Applications. 

**Billing Information.** While many products and services on our Site are provided free, some require payment from you by credit/debit card (“Billing Information”). We collect, and if you are purchasing a recurring billing subscription, we store Billing Information but this information is only shared with third parties who perform tasks required to verify and complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit/debit cards. 

**_Information Collected Through Technology and Advertising_**

In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the CriminalSearches.com Applications (“Usage Information”), including the device used to access CriminalSearches.com Applications (“Device”), and the IP address or other unique identifier identified by that Device (“Device Identifier”). Your Device Identifier may also identify your regional location. This Usage Information is used for many purposes including, for example, to: 

  * Provide useful features to simplify your experience when you return to CriminalSearches.com Applications; for example, remembering the searches you conducted
  * Deliver relevant content based on your preferences, usage patterns and location
  * Monitor and evaluate the use and operation of our CriminalSearches.com Applications
  * Analyze traffic on our CriminalSearches.com Applications and on the sites and applications of third parties
  * We may associate this tracking data with your registration account, in which case we will treat it as personal information.



Third party service providers might combine information they collect from your interaction with CriminalSearches.com Applications with personal information they collect from other sources. We do not have access to, nor control over, third parties' use of tracking technologies. Service providers that collect tracking data on our behalf may provide an opportunity for you to choose not to be tracked online.

We have no control over these third parties' use of this information. We will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if we will be providing this information to third parties.

### **Cookies**

A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server and stored by the user's Web browser so the information can later be read back from that browser. Cookies enable the browser to identify itself to the server, and allow the server to maintain an active "session" with an individual user. Cookies help the browser remember some specific information. We make limited use of cookies to make your visit to the Site easier, to improve the user experience and to identify individual users who have an Account with us. We also use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to gather statistical information about how our Site is used. This statistical information is not connected to any of your personal information.
