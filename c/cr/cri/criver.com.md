# Charles River Website Privacy Policy

**To make an EU General Data Protection Regulation Request, please fill out[this form](https://web.archive.org/resources/eu-gdpr-data-subject-request-form).**

This website (excluding linked websites) is controlled by us. All content and materials that comprise the website, including the website design, text, graphics, photographs, illustrations, images, icons and other materials, data, and information are protected by copyright under United States and international copyright laws and treaties and are our exclusive property.

We understand that various laws and regulations around the world govern data protection and we respect the fact that protecting your privacy is important to you. For those reasons, we created this Website Privacy Policy. Please review this policy to learn about how we collect, use, share, and protect information.

First and foremost, **we only collect personal information if you choose to give it to us**. We retain the right to share your personal information with our corporate affiliates and with outside companies or agents working on our behalf to help fulfill our business obligations. However, we do not share any of your personal information with third parties for their own use unless you explicitly give us permission to do so.

When you browse our website, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously indicated that you wish us to remember your login and password. We do not automatically collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your IP address to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there. We do use a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how you use the site. Please go to “Cookies” below for more information. We do collect personal information when you register with us for an account, when you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, and when you voluntarily submit your personal information to us for any other reason. When we collect personal information, we inform you at the point of collection.

This Website Privacy Policy applies only to personal information collected online from our websites.

## Information Collected – Information You Give Us

On our websites, we only collect your personal information (such as your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address) when you choose to submit it to us, and we only use it for those purposes which you approved. For example, you may register to receive additional product information or other company information, in which case your personal information will be used only for that purpose. In some cases, we remove personal identifiers from data and maintain it in aggregate form. We may combine this data with other information to produce anonymous, aggregated statistical information helpful to us in improving our products and services.

## Automatically Collected Information

We automatically collect certain types of information whenever you interact with us on our websites and in some e-mails we may send each other.  Automatic technologies we use include, for example, web server logs, IP addresses, cookies, and web beacons.

_Web Server Logs and IP Addresses:_   Our server log files are stored in a secure location, and can only be accessed by our authorized employees. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet that allows computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. We collect IP addresses to conduct system administration and report aggregated information to affiliates, business partners, service providers, and/or vendors to conduct website analysis and performance reviews. This information is kept indefinitely for historical purposes.

_Database Storage:_   We use multiple databases to record and retrieve information sent to us through web forms (such as contact information, products and services requested, and billing/payment information). This information is kept indefinitely for historical purposes and is used for billing purposes and to fill customers’ orders. For example, if we have trouble processing your order, the information is used to contact you.

_Cookies:_   A cookie is a piece of information that is placed on your computer when you access certain websites.  The cookie uniquely identifies your browser to the server. Cookies allow us to store information on the server to help customize your web experience and to conduct website analysis and performance reviews. We make use of a web browser cookie for the sole purpose of giving the visitors of our websites the option to login quickly, without requiring them to put in a username and password for their account each time. Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies, although you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some portions of our websites may not work properly if you refuse cookies. The cookie that we create will last for exactly one year from the time of creation, at which time a new cookie will be created upon the next login.

_Web Beacons:_   On certain web pages or e-mails, we may utilize a common Internet technology called a "web beacon" (also known as an "action tag" or "clear GIF technology"). Web beacons help analyze the effectiveness of websites by measuring, for example, the number of visitors to a site or how many visitors clicked on key elements of a site.

Web beacons, cookies, and other tracking technologies do not automatically obtain personal information about you. If you voluntarily submit personal information, such as by registering or sending e-mails, then these automatic tracking technologies can be used to provide further information about your use of the websites to improve their usefulness to you.

## Your Choices

You have certain options regarding your use of our websites. We may require you to provide certain personal information in order for you to receive additional product information or other company information. You could decide not to submit any personal information at all by not entering it into any forms or data fields on our websites and not using any available personalized services. Certain websites may ask for your permission for certain uses of your personal information and you can agree to or decline those uses. If you opt-in for particular services or communications, such as an e-newsletter, you will be able to unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions included in each communication. If you decide to unsubscribe from a service or communication, we will work to remove your information promptly, although we may require additional information before we can process your request.

As described above, if you wish to prevent cookies from tracking you anonymously as you navigate our websites, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, some portions of our websites may not work properly if you refuse cookies.

## Use of Personal Information

We, and/or our service providers, vendors, and other third parties we hire to perform services on our behalf, may use any personal information you choose to give us to comply with your requests, as otherwise disclosed to you in this Website Privacy Policy, or on the web page where you submit your information to us. We may refer to this information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services. We also use depersonalized, aggregated information collected from our websites to help us understand trends and customer needs. For example, we may analyze the gender or age of visitors to our websites in relation to a particular product or service we offer, and we may use that analysis of aggregate data internally or share it with affiliates.

## Data Sharing and Transfer

We may share personal information about you with various outside companies, service providers, or vendors working on our behalf to help further our business including, but not limited to, providing customer service, sending marketing communications about our products, services, and offers, and performing technological maintenance.  We may also share personal information with our affiliates.

We may disclose personal information for the following purposes:

1\. in connection with the sale, assignment or other transfer of the business of the site to which the data relates;

2\. to respond to requests of government or law enforcement agencies or where required or permitted by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations; or

3\. when needed for corporate audits or to investigate or respond to a complaint or security threat.

_No Third-Party Direct Marketing Use:_   We will not sell or otherwise transfer personal information you provide to us on our websites to any third parties for their own direct marketing use unless we provide clear notice to you and obtain your explicit consent for your data to be shared in this manner.

_E-mail a Friend or Colleague:_ On some of our websites, you can choose to send a link or a message to a friend or colleague referring them to our website. The e-mail address you provide for a friend will be used to send your friend information on your behalf and will not be collected or used by us or other third parties for additional purposes.

_Note to Users of Business or Professional Websites:_   If you have a business or professional relationship with us, we may use information you submit on our websites, including those websites intended specifically for our business and professional users, to fulfill your requests and develop our business relationship with you and the entities you represent. We may also share such information with third parties acting on our behalf.

## Links to Other Sites

Our websites may contain links to third party websites that may offer useful information to our visitors.  This Website Privacy Policy does not apply to third party sites, and we recommend communicating with such parties directly for information on their privacy policies.

## Privacy Statement for Children Under 18

Our websites are not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 18.  If you are under the age of 18, you must not provide your personal information. We do not collect personal information from any person we actually know is a person under the age of 18.

## Additional Information on Websites

If one of our websites has particular provisions relating to privacy that differ from those stated here, those provisions will be disclosed to you on the page on which your personal information is collected.

## Notification of Policy Change

This policy may be amended from time to time. If we decide to change our Website Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this policy on our website so visitors to our websites are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information is collected.
