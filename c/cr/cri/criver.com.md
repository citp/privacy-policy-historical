# Charles River Website Privacy Policy

**To make an EU General Data Protection Regulation Request, please fill out[this form](https://web.archive.org/resources/eu-gdpr-data-subject-request-form).**

## I. Purpose

This website (excluding linked websites) is controlled by Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Charles River Laboratories,” “we,” “our,” or “us”).

We understand that various laws and regulations around the world govern personal data protection, and we respect the fact that protecting your privacy is important to you. For those reasons, we created this Website Privacy Policy. Please review this policy to learn about how and why we collect, use, share, and protect information.

This Website Privacy Policy applies only to personal data collected online from our websites.

Your use of our website or related services is subject to the then-current version of this Website Privacy Policy, so we urge you to read this document in full from time to time, and contact us using the contact information below if you have any questions.

## II. Who We Are

Charles River Laboratories provides a variety of pre-clinical and clinical laboratory services for the pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology industries. Our corporate headquarters are located in Wilmington, Massachusetts, USA.

## III. What Information We Collect

### **Information You Give Us**

We collect your personal data (such as your professional information, contact information, payment information, sales information, and tradeshow related information) when you choose to submit it to us on our website, and we use it for those purposes which you approved. We may combine this data with other information to produce anonymous, aggregated statistical information to help us improve our products and services.

### **Automatically Collected Information**

We automatically collect certain types of information whenever you interact with us on our websites and in some e-mails that we send to you. Automatic technologies we use include, for example, web server logs, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, cookies, web beacons and third-party tools.

  * _Web Server Logs_ : A web server log is a log file of activities performed that is created and maintained by a server.
  * _IP Address_ : An IP address is a number assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet that allows computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other.
  * _Cookies_ : A cookie is a piece of information that is placed on your computer when you access certain websites. The cookie uniquely identifies your browser to the server. Cookies allow us to store information on the server to help customize your web experience and to conduct website analysis and performance reviews. We use session and persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only during one session and disappear when you close your browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer or device after you close your browser or turn off your computer.
  * _Web Beacons_ : On certain web pages or e-mails, we may utilize a common Internet technology called a "web beacon" (also known as an "action tag" or "clear GIF technology"). Web beacons help us analyze the effectiveness of websites by measuring, for example, the number of visitors to a site or how many visitors clicked on key elements of a site.
  * _Third-Party Tools_ : Third party tools (such as Google Analytics) use cookies to collect information about the use of websites, pages visited, frequency of visits, and how individuals found the site.



## IV. Our Use of Personal Data

### **Information You Give Us**

We may use any personal data you choose to give us to comply with your requests, to communicate with you, and generally to improve our products, services, and website.

### **Providing Product and Services You Request**

If you choose to buy our products or use our services, we may use the personal data you submit to fulfil your requests. We may use personal data for customer relationship or account management, to help with product distribution, sales, customer service, and for customer transaction management.

### **Marketing and Events**

You may also choose to receive information for marketing purposes or events. In such cases, we will use personal data for direct marketing communications, marketing or sales analytics, lead generation, business development, event management, market research and development, education and training (including technical training), and continuing education or accreditation.

### **Site Analytics and Improvement**

We will use personal data submitted to us, in conjunction with such automatically collected information (as described under “Automatically Collected Information” below), to improve our website operation by monitoring user patterns and preferences.

We also use depersonalized, aggregated information collected from our websites to help us understand trends and customer needs, and we may use that analysis of aggregated data internally or share it with our affiliates.

### **Automatically Collected Information**

We use automatically collected information as described below.

  * _Web Server Logs_ : We collect data in our web server logs for monitoring system performance and making sizing decisions, for information security purposes, and for troubleshooting purposes. The data may consist of IP addresses, URLs requested, and other typical web server log elements.
  * _IP Addresses_ : We collect IP addresses to determine which country your access is coming from to display content appropriate for your locale, to conduct system administration, and to report aggregated information to affiliates, business partners, service providers, and/or vendors who conduct website analysis and performance reviews.
  * _Cookies_ : We make use of both session and persistent cookies for numerous purposes including: enabling basic functions and access to secured sections of the website, remembering your preferences (such as a preferred language), recording statistical traffic between our various web properties, and for personalization and marketing purposes. Some portions of our websites may not work properly if you refuse cookies.
  * _Web Beacons_ : We use web beacons to help analyze the effectiveness of websites by measuring, for example, the number of visitors to a site or how many visitors clicked on key elements of a site.
  * _Third-Party Tools_ : We use third-party tools such as Google Analytics to collect information about the use of our website. The third-party tools gather statistical information about traffic between our various web properties and gather information for personalization and marketing purposes.



## V. Retention

Cookies that are created may be kept up to 20 years from the time of creation. Market investigations, market research data, and surveys are kept for 10 years. Sales analysis data is kept for 7 years.

We use multiple databases to record and retrieve information sent to us through web forms (such as contact information, products and services requested, and billing/payment information). This information is kept for as long as needed to fulfill specific business purposes or purposes for which it was collected.

For all other data, a fixed retention period is not possible to determine. Instead we review data for retention based on the following: the purpose of the information; if the information could be reasonably gathered from another source; levels of risk, cost, and liability involved with keeping the information; if the information is still relevant for the original purpose; and the accuracy of the information.

In some cases, laws or regulations that apply to our business may require us to keep information longer than needed for a specific business purpose.

## VI. Information Security

We take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard any information you provide to us from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. To this effect, our server log files are stored in a secure location and can only be accessed by our authorized employees. Although we take commercially reasonable steps, no system can ever by completely secure or error-free. In addition, it is your responsibility to safeguard any user names, passwords, or information associated with your account.
