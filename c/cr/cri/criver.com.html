        Privacy Statement</h6>

        to protect the personal information that you share with us. Generally,
        you can browse through our website without giving us any information
        about yourself. When we do need personal information to provide services
        that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal
        information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal
      information.
      </p>
      <h6>INFORMATION COLLECTED</h6>
      <p class="crlBodyTxt">Personal information means any information that may
        be used to identify an individual, including , but not limited to , a
        first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical
        address, other contact information, title, birth date, gender, occupation,
        industry, personal interests, other information when needed to provide
      a service you requested.</p>
      <p class="crlBodyTxt">When you browse our website, you do so anonymously,
        unless you have previously indicated that you wish CRL to remember your
        login and password. We do
        not automatically collect personal information, including your email
        address. We do log your IP address to give us an idea of which part of
        our website you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link
        your IP address to any personal information unless you have logged in
        to our website. We do use a standard technology called “cookie” to
        collect information about how you use the site. Please go to “Web

          mailing list, when you submit your personal information to Charles
        River for any other reason. When personal
      information is collected, we will inform you at the point of collection.</p>
      <h6>INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETENTION AND USAGE</h6>
      <p><span class="crlSubhead">Server log files</span><br>
        <span class="crlBodyTxt">Our server log files are stored in a secure location, 
        and can only be accessed by employees of Charles River Laboratories. This 
        information is kept indefinitely for historical purposes. This information 
        is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement 
        in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate 
        use.</span></p>
      <p><span class="crlSubhead">Database storage</span><br>
        <span class="crlBodyTxt">We make use of multiple databases to record and 
        retrieve information sent to us through web forms (such as contact information, 
        products and services requested, and any billing/payment information, 
        etc.). This information is kept indefinitely for historical purposes. 
        This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's 
        orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used 
        to contact the user.</span></p>
      <span class="crlSubhead">Web browser cookies</span><br>
      <span class="crlBodyTxt">We make use of a web browser cookie for the sole 
      purpose of giving the visitors of our website the option to login quickly, 
      without the hassle of putting in the username and password of their account. 
      These cookies are created by the visitors browser, and are generally saved 
      somewhere on the visitor's hard drive. Visitors have the ability to 
      disable this feature at any time, either by unselecting "Automatically 
      login from this computer" in their account information, or by disabling 
      the use of cookies on their web browser. The cookie that we create will 
      last for exactly one year from the time of creation, at which time a new 
      cookie will be created upon the next login.</span><br>
      <h6>SHARING OF INFORMATION</h6>
      <p><span class="crlSubhead">Legal disclaimer</span><br>
        <span class="crlBodyTxt">Charles River will not transfer your personal
        information to third parties without your consent, except under limited
        conditions. Though we make every effort to preserve user 
        privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by
         law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary
        
        to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal
        process  served on our Web site. Charles River is a global company, your
        personal information may be shared with other Charles River offices or
        subsidiaries around the world. All such entities are governed by this
        Privacy Policy or are bound by the appropriate confidentiality and data
        transfer agreements. If you choose to provide us with your personal information,
        we will only transfer that information with your permission.</span></p>
      <p><span class="crlSubhead">Third party intermediaries</span><br>
        <span class="crlBodyTxt">We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, 
        and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. 
        These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable 
        information for any secondary purposes.</span></p>
      <p><span class="crlSubhead">Business transitions</span><br>
        <span class="crlBodyTxt">In the event Charles River Laboratories goes 
        through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another 
        company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information 
        will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will 
        be notified via a notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change 
        of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result 
        of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information 
        will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection 
        they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes 
        section.</span></p>
      <h6>INFORMATION SECURITY</h6>
      <span class="crlBodyTxt">This Web site takes every precaution to protect 
      our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via 
      the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. </span> 
      <p><span class="crlBodyTxt">When our order form asks users to enter sensitive 
        information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted 
        and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry: SSL. 
        While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom 
        of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer 
        becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 
        'surfing'.</span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="crlBodyTxt">While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive 
        information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information 
        off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive 
        information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees 
        who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing 
        clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally 
        identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable 
        information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.</span></p>
      <h6>UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h6>
      <p class="crlBodyTxt">If a user's personally identifiable information changes 
        (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), we provide a way to 
        correct, update users' personally identifiable information. This can usually 
        be done by "selecting "Modify my account information" after 
        logging in.</p>
      <h6>COMMUNICATION</h6>
      <p><span class="crlSubhead">Automatic emails</span><br>
        <span class="crlBodyTxt">Our server will automatically send you an email 
        at certain events during a web form submission. These events include but 
        are not limited to first time account creation, forgotten password retrieval, 
        order confirmation, etc. These emails are strictly used to keep the user 
        well informed.</span></p>
      <p><span class="crlSubhead">Customer service</span><br>
        <span class="crlBodyTxt">We communicate with users on a regular basis 
        to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their 
        account we reply via email or phone.</span></p>
      <h6>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h6>
      <p class="crlBodyTxt">This Web site contains links to other sites. Please 
        be aware that we, Charles River Laboratories, are not responsible for 
        the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be 
        aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each 
        and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. 
        This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this 
        Web site.</p>
      <h6>NOTIFICATION OF POLICY CHANGE</h6>
      <p class="crlBodyTxt">If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will 
        post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem 
        appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, 
        how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We 
        will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which 
        the information was collected.</p>
      <h6>Contact information</h6>

        our privacy policy, please contact us at:</p>
