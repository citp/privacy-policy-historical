<h2>OUR TRACKING ACTIVITIES AND YOUR CHOICES</h2>
<p>We - or third parties - use browser cookies, web beacons, and Flash cookies. We use these methods to limit multiple responses and registrations, for market research analysis, to facilitate your ability to navigate the Sites, and as part of a verification or screening process. Information collected may be linked to your personal information, and may be shared with third parties for the reasons described in this policy.</p>
<p>You can control browser cookies by modifying your settings in your browser. You can control Flash cookies (these are similar to traditional cookies, but reside in Adobe Flash Player rather than your browser and thus will not be affected by any browser setting changes you make) by going to <a href="http://phtshp.us/edMmSQ" target="_blank">http://phtshp.us/edMmSQ</a> and following the instructions on that page.</p>
<p>Some parts of the Sites may not operate correctly if you disable cookies, and you may not be able to participate in projects or join panels, or take advantage of some of the Sites' features.</p>
<h2>SECURITY</h2>
<p>To help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place what we believe to be appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.</p>
<p>We cannot guarantee, however, that the information we collect will remain secure. The Internet by its nature is a public medium, and we encourage you to use caution when disclosing information online.</p>
<h2><span>YOUR RIGHTS FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</span></h2>
<p><span>If you have an established business relationship with us you may request from us a list of the categories of personal information we have disclosed to third parties for those third parties' marketing purposes during the previous calendar year, and a list of those third parties. We will include in that list the names and addresses of the third parties who received the information and used it (or who we believe may have used it) for their own marketing purposes in the last calendar year.</span></p>
<p>To exercise your rights, you may make one request each year by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@crresearch.com" target="_blank">privacy@crresearch.com</a> or writing us at the address listed in the "Contact Us" section below. Indicate in your letter that you are a California resident making a "Shine the Light" inquiry. Responses will be provided within 30 days.</p>
<h2>NON-US USERS</h2>
<p>The Sites are operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States and that by using the Sites/giving your information, you consent to such transfer, and understand that the U.S. may not provide the same level of protections as the laws of your country.</p>
<h2>LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES</h2>
<p>Please be aware that when you are on this Web Site or viewing an e-mail from us, you could be directed to other web pages or online content through links that take you outside our service and are beyond our control. These other web sites may set their own cookies, collect data, and/or have their own privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected by us on the Sites, and we encourage you to review the privacy policy of any other web site you visit.</p>
<h2>MODIFICATIONS TO THIS POLICY</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to modify, alter, or otherwise update this Privacy Policy at any time. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back from time to time.</p>
