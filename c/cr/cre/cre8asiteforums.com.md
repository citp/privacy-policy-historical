For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others, such as our advertisers, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.
