##  Last updated: July 30th, 2009. To see what has changed, [ click here]().

Welcome! We are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy provides information about our privacy practices and applies to all information collected on this site. Our Privacy Policy may change periodically as we respond to evolving technology, changes in our products or services and/or consumer needs and expectations.

##  Types of information we collect

###  Anonymous Information

Anonymous information refers to information that cannot be linked to a specific individual. Anonymous information is analyzed and used to make general improvements to our web site and the services we provide. We may collect anonymous information either directly or from a third-party. The anonymous information we collect may include, but is not limited to:

  * The browser and operating system used
  * Which of our web pages is visited and for how long
  * Search terms used to find our web site
  * Date and time the site is accessed
  * Length of time spent on our web site



Additionally, we may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals or by removing items such as your name or address that make the resulting information personally identifiable to you. Once information is de-personalized in this manner, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon our rights to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and we may use and/or share the resulting non-personally identifiable information with third-parties in any manner.

###  Personally Identifiable Information

Personally identifiable information refers to information that can be linked to a specific individual. We collect your personal information only if you decide to register for, log on, or visit our web sites, purchase one of our products or services, participate in a free trial or other promotional program, participate in our affiliate program, subscribe to our newsletter, participate in one or more of our contests or surveys, request further information related to promotional offers on our site, or transact other business with us. Personally identifiable information may be collected on applications, forms and in correspondence (written or oral). Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:

  * Name (first and last)
  * Address (current and previous home and/or billing)
  * Email address
  * Telephone numbers
  * Social Security number
  * Date of birth
  * Employment information
  * Credit card information
  * Information in your credit report (used to verify identity)
  * At times, we may also use IP addresses to collect information regarding visits to various parts of our web sites



In general, personally identifiable information is used for the purpose for which you provide it. Certain services offered through us cannot be provided without personally identifiable information. Specifically, personally identifiable information is used to verify the identity of the one requesting access to a credit report to ensure that no one else has access to your credit report.

Our web sites may also use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including tracking pixels. Tracking pixels are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of web sites. These technical methods are used to analyze the traffic patterns on our web sites, such as how often our users visit various parts of our web sites. These technical methods may involve the communication of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We may also use these technical methods in HTML emails that we send our visitors to determine whether they have opened those emails and/or clicked on links in those emails. The information obtained from the use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.

###  How We Share Your Information

When you order a product or service through us, we must share some of your personally identifiable information with third-parties in order to fulfill your order. We cannot, for example, retrieve your credit report or credit score without sharing your personal information with the provider of that service. We cannot process your order payment without sharing personal information with our credit card payment processor. These third-parties are not permitted to use your personal information for any purpose other than to provide the requested service.

We may also share your information with affiliated and non-affiliated third-parties to offer products or services that may be of interest or benefit to our customers. If you prefer not to receive such offers, you may indicate your preference when you place an order, when you receive such an offer or by updating your account information.

Additionally, if you choose, we may disclose information that is collected about you to our affiliated and non-affiliated third-parties for purposes of marketing and to provide you with offers as to products we feel may be in furtherance of your interest. To the extent that you express interest in certain products or categories of products, we may also provide you with the opportunity to obtain additional information and offers as to those products. If you do not wish to receive such offers, you may opt-out. New members may opt-out during initial enrollment and existing members must contact us directly to opt-out. Please note that we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies of any web site, or vendor other than ourselves.

We may also disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures are required by law, or will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of our web sites, our company(ies), and/or third-parties, including the safety and security of property that belongs to us or third-parties.

###  Former Customers

Even if you are no longer our customer, our Privacy Policy will apply to you.

###  Security

We maintain strict physical, technical and administrative standards to protect the personal information we collect and use to provide our services. Information is encrypted and transmitted via a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Pages which use this technology can be identified by "https" at the beginning of the URL. Additional procedures are in place to protect your information from unauthorized access. This includes, but is not limited to, internal and external firewalls and physical security of the premises.

Consumers who use our web sites and services can further enhance the security of their information by following reasonable personal security measures. This would include safeguarding your password and not leaving your information on an unattended computer.
