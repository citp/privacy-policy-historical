### Cookies

Like many websites, we use “cookies”, which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment that record your preferences and actions. We use cookies to track use of our Site and online services. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Site and make it easier and/or relevant for your use.

There are two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie expires shortly after you close your browser. Persistent cookies are stored on your hard drive until they expire or are deleted. Both types of cookies are used to make it easier for you to navigate our Website -- for example, by remembering your shopping preferences, shopping cart, and user information.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to disable or reject cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this Site may then be inaccessible or not function properly. For more information on cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at [www.allaboutcookies.org.](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)

We may also use web beacons or flash cookies. A web beacon or flash cookie (also known as “action tags”, “tracer tags”, or “single-pixel gifs”) is an invisible graphic on a web page that is programmed to collect non-personally identifiable information about your use of a given website. We do not share or provide personally identifiable information we may collect through such web beacons, such as names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers, without your express permission.

We may partner with third party advertising companies who may utilize flash or enhanced cookies or web beacons to better provide advertisements about our products and services that may be of interest to you. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use the Site. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted content. These partners do not have access to or use your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personally identifiable information from us, without your consent. They may, however, use persistent identifiers to anonymously track your internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond this Site. Such third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify you, unknown to us. We do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.

### Changes to this Policy

We may update the Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our Services and practices. We will post changes to the Privacy Policy on the Site so that you will know about changes in the way we gather, use or share your personal information. We may also notify you of material changes in the Privacy Policy by sending an email, but you should check this Privacy Policy each time you use the Site in case you missed a notice of changes. Your continued use of our Site after we make changes will mean you accept those changes in our policy and practices.
