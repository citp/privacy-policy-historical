If we are unable to verify your identity from the information you provide to us on this web site we will advise you by e-mail to the e-mail address you specify and you may then wish to make a written application including further proof of identification.

In addition to the primary purposes listed above we may also use the information we collect about you as set out in the section entitled "DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES" below or for other authorised secondary purposes such as:

We restrict access to your personal data to those employees, and third parties, who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal data.

Experian protects your information over the Internet by using secure web server technologies, which allows web browser programs (Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer) to interact with Experian's web server via an encrypted session.
