# Experian Privacy Policy

* ### To enable you to access our website and use our services

We will use your information to accept you as a new/returning customer and continue to provide you with our products and services.

### To let you know about significant changes to our products, terms or privacy policy

We will let you know by email, SMS, push notification or when you log in to the site if there are significant changes to our products, their features, our terms, or our privacy policy.

### To confirm your identity and authenticate the information you provide

As part of providing services to you we will confirm your identity and authenticate the information you provide for security purposes.

Establishing your identity is important as the services may provide you with your personal credit information (such as your credit score or credit report) and we must be sure you are who you say you are. Identity checking may also involve checking the registration information you give us against information we already hold about you as a credit reference agency and potentially publicly available information about you such as from social media.

If we are unable to confirm your identity from the registration information you provide, we will let you know by using the contact details you have provided and you may then have the option to make a written application and provide further proof of your identity.

### To process payments and collect arrears

We will use your information to process the payments you commit to when signing up to our services and for the collection of any future payments or overdue amounts for those services.

Your payment card provider may let us know if the card details relating to your Experian payment change. If this happens, we reserve the right to update certain card details to make sure your access to our services isn’t interrupted.

So for example, if you get a new payment card with a later expiry date to the one you currently pay with (but all the other details stay the same), we may update your payment card expiry date accordingly.

### To provide and improve customer support

We will use your information to be able to provide and improve the customer support we provide to you (e.g. when you have questions or when you forget your log-in information). 

### To provide alerts 

We will use your information to send you alerts where ‘Alerts’ are part of the service you ask us to provide e.g.

  * web-monitoring when we find your personal details are available to others online.
  * where there are certain changes to your credit report.



### To send you service communications

We will use your information to contact you to tell you about changes to or issues affecting the services you are taking.

### To provide comparison services and create eligibility ratings

When you use our comparison service to search for products, the information you provide is used to retrieve information about products relevant to your search and create a table which allows you to compare them.

Where eligibility ratings are available, information from your credit file with Experian (and sometimes Callcredit and Equifax) is also used to help you understand whether you are likely to be accepted.

In some circumstances, we will share that information and your personal information (such as name and address) with brokers, lenders and providers of credit and financial products themselves (as described in the section "Who we share your personal information with").

### To provide information related to your use of our comparison services

When you search for products, we may contact you by email or SMS to confirm activity relating to use of our comparison services, such as details of the searches you have made, results that you have seen when searching, or information about introductions you’ve requested to brokers and lenders.

### To send you product eligibility alerts

As part of our free services (which are available to all customers), Experian will retrieve and use your credit bureau data (whether it’s from Experian or the other two main credit reference agencies Equifax and Callcredit) to check your eligibility (as described in the above section ‘To provide comparison services and create eligibility ratings’) for third party products or services and notify you of credit opportunities, products and services that you may be eligible for.

When you log in to the website, we will show you updated eligibility ratings for products and services that may be available to you.

As part of this service we may also notify you by e-mail, SMS or post of new or updated eligibility ratings for products and services; for example if new products and services are added, or your eligibility has changed. You can chose not to receive email, SMS and postal communications about product eligibility whenever you want from your Experian Account page.

We will check your eligibility for third party products and services, and may send you alerts:

  * when you log in to the website;
  * when you request an eligibility check;
  * at regular intervals (no more than every 30 days) since you last requested an eligibility check;
  * when new credit products and services are added to the website;
  * when there is a change to your credit bureau data or Experian Credit Score (and we may pro-actively check your credit bureau data and Experian Credit Score to do this – which will not affect your credit rating);
  * when we predict you may be interested in a new credit product or service, for example if your existing promotional period is coming to an end.



### Marketing

We will use your information for marketing purposes such as if we think one of our products, services or offers, or those of our third party partners, may interest you, we or they may contact you about them by email, SMS, on the phone, through app notifications or through the post.

If your Experian subscription has finished, we may contact you and invite you to re-subscribe to the same or a different service or product, or to use certain free features on our website.

You can opt out of marketing communications at any time by following the instructions in the email or SMS or by contacting us at [customerservices@uk.experian.com](mailto:customerservices@uk.experian.com). You can turn off app notifications at any time using the tools provided in your mobile operating system.

### Market research

Experian may select particular customers and invite them to be involved in market research. If you accept this invitation, we will use the feedback you give us to improve our products and services.

### Administration of prize draws, competitions, membership offers, surveys and other promotional activities

From time to time we will run prize draws, competitions, promotions and surveys and, we will use the personal data you provide to us, to run such activities and to do what we agree to do as part of them.

### Fraud investigation, detection and prevention

We may use your information for fraud investigation, detection and prevention measures and in order to provide suitable security for your account and your information that we hold (such as to enable us to prevent others logging in to your account without your permission from unknown devices).

### Investigation, detection and prevention of crime

We may use your information for the investigation, detection and prevention of crime (other than fraud).

### Internal training purposes

We will use your information to ensure that our team has the knowledge and expertise they need to ensure we provide the best possible experience to our customers when interacting with us.

### Reporting and analytical purposes

We will use your information for reporting and analytical purposes (e.g. how many of our customers are in the north or south of the country) to enable us to improve our products and services and to provide appropriate levels of support to our customers. 

### Tracking activity

We will use your information to track your activity on our apps and on our websites to help us better understand your interests and how you interact with us. We may also use this information to help us detect if someone else is trying to access your account or use the services you take from us. We will also use this information to better engage with you and to ensure that you get the best service we can provide and improve our products in the future.

### To maintain our records and other administrative functions

Like any business, we need to ensure that we maintain comprehensive and up to date records of the ways we process your personal information and other operational activities and therefore we will process the information you provide for record-keeping, updates and general administrative purposes.

### Complaint and dispute resolution

Whilst we will try to make sure that you are happy with the service we provide and do not feel the need to complain, if you do complain to us, we will use the information we have about you to help us manage your complaint.

### To comply with the law

Like any other business, we are required to comply with many laws and regulations. We will, where necessary, use your personal data to the extent required to enable us to comply with these requirements.

### To improve data accuracy and completeness

Personal information you provide to us may be used to improve the credit bureau information we already hold about you in our role as a credit reference agency. E.g. if you provide a different address to the one we hold already we may store the new address in the credit bureau information to aid quicker identification of you and ensure that lenders can see a full picture of you when making lending decisions, it also aids identification and verification in the credit application process.

### Email tracking

Experian may use performance tracking technology within our emails to improve our future interactions with you. This means we are able to capture information including (but not limited to) the time and date you open our e-mails and the type of device used to open the email.

We use this information primarily to understand whether our e-mails are opened and what links are clicked on by our customers. We then use this information to improve the emails that we send to you and the services that we provide.

We may share this information with other organisations to help them improve their own interactions with you. Your personal data will not be passed to any third party for marketing purposes unless you already have an existing relationship with them. You will not receive marketing emails from such third party organisations unless you have given your prior consent to them to send emails to you.

Further information is included in our [Cookies Policy](http://www.experian.co.uk/legal/cookies-policy.html).

### Further uses of your personal information not described in this Privacy Policy

If we use your personal information for any purposes that are not set out in this Privacy Policy we promise to let you know exactly what we will use it for before we go ahead and use it and obtain your consent where appropriate.
