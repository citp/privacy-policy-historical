This vendor uses cookies and transparent images called "web beacons" to collect this information. Like cookies, web beacons do not allow us or the vendor to identify you personally. This data helps us understand how visitors use our website, such as the most visited pages and features. Omniture does not collect any personally identifiable information from you, and they do not share the non-personally identifiable information collected with anyone else for any other purpose.

**How does CreditCards.com SECURE the information collected?**   
CreditCards.com has security measures in place and takes reasonable precautions to protect against the loss, misuse, and unauthorized access of your personal information under our control. To help us accomplish this, we adopt the following procedures: 

  * Employ internal access controls to ensure that the only people who see your information are those with a need to do so to perform their official duties.
  * Train relevant personnel on our privacy and security measures.
  * Regularly back up the information we collect online to insure against loss.
  * Use technical controls to secure the information we collect online as appropriate, including but not limited to: encryption, firewalls and password protections.
  * Periodically test our security procedures to ensure personnel and technical compliance.



We use reasonable measures to ensure that all credit card applications listed with CreditCards.com use a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) connection. Provided you are using a SSL enabled browser, your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet when you apply for a credit card at the issuer's website. You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock or key icon in the lower right-hand or left-hand corner of the computer screen appears in the locked position. You will usually only see this icon only when you are filling out an application. In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https". We are not responsible for the security of data transmitted from your computer to any issuer or other third-party website. For more information on security, please read our [Site Security](https://web.archive.org/SSL-Security.php) policy.

If you are under 18 years of age, please do not submit any personal information through our website without the express consent and participation of a parent or guardian. 

**Does this policy cover OTHER sites linked from CreditCards.com?**   
This policy covers our online practices and does not apply to any third party sites, including card issuers or other sites that may be linked from our website. We encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of those other sites to learn how they collect and use information about you. 

**Who may I CONTACT if I have questions or concerns about the privacy or security of my information?**
