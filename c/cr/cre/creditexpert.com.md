**WHAT IS OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU?**  
We are sensitive to your privacy concerns, and are committed to letting you know what information is being collected on our Sites, how the information is being used and what choices you have regarding the collection and use of the information. Please take a moment to review this privacy notice and feel free to contact us with any questions at [privacy@consumerinfo.com](mailto:privacy@consumerinfo.com).

**WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?**  
The primary reason we collect personal and credit information about you is to provide products that you have requested and to enroll you into our membership products. The type of information we collect, and the primary purpose for which it is collected includes:

  * Required product registration information such as name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth, is utilized to establish your membership or one-time transaction record and to verify your identity. We require this verification in order to provide you with your personal credit information.
  * Credit information we receive from credit reporting agencies is utilized to provide you with the products we offer.
  * Billing information, such as credit card number, is required to process the payment for the products you order from us.
  * Other information we collect, such as city of birth and mother's maiden name, is used to verify your identity in the event you forget your login information required for our online products. E-mail addresses are collected and used to send you notifications, special offers and our latest e-newsletter via electronic mail.



Corrections or updates to your information including your email address, phone number, mailing address, credit card information or password reminder phrase can be made through "My Credit Center" in the section labeled "Account Tools." If necessary, other corrections or updates to your information (such as your name or Social Security number) can be made by contacting a customer care representative at 1-866-673-0140. For your protection, our customer care representatives may request supporting documents before making any changes or updates to your membership information.

**DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?**  
**We do not share information with any non-affiliated third party except:** (1) in select circumstances when a business partner refers you to us and you give us permission to share specific information, such as your name and email address, with that business partner on your order form, or (2) as permitted or required by law, such as inquires by law enforcement or to comply with Federal laws such as the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (CAN-SPAM Act of 2003) or the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA).  
If you choose, we may disclose the information that we collect to our affiliated companies from time to time for marketing purposes and to enhance our products to better suit your needs. When identifying methods of improving our products or if we think a product may be of interest to you, we may arrange to extend select special offers of goods or services to you either directly or through affiliates. If you would like to opt-out of having your information shared with partners and/or affiliates, please refer to the section labeled "Offering You Choices - Marketing Options," below.  
In order to provide the products you have requested, we may disclose the information we collect to companies that perform services on our behalf such as the credit reporting agencies from which we obtain your credit report(s), credit card processors, e-mail communications management firms or call center providers. Our third party service providers are contractually limited to using the information received from ConsumerInfo.com, Inc. solely for the purposes of providing you with the services you requested.

We cannot, however, be responsible for their privacy practices.
