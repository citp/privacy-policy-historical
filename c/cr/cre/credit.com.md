Credit.com is dedicated to protecting the privacy of our customers. Credit.com’s privacy policy and information practices have been independently certified for compliance by the TRUSTe® Privacy Program. Credit.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy policy covers the site www.credit.com. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.

### What information we collect and how we collect it.

We collect the following categories of NPPI: (i) information you provide such as your contact information; (ii) information about your transactions with us or our affiliates; (iii) information about your transactions with non-affiliated third-parties to whom your information is disclosed by us to fulfill a transaction you request, such as obtaining a personal loan or credit card; and (iv) information obtained from any consumer reporting agency, such as your credit history. 

### Traffic data

We automatically track and collect traffic data. Traffic data is information that does not identify you personally but may include your IP address, ISP and other similar types of information that help us administer our site, and improve our service offerings. We use cookies and web-beacons to track traffic data and customer transactions for accounting purposes. 

No NPPI information that identifies a customer or former customer is revealed in the collection and use of traffic data. Consequently, we do not adjust or alter our website’s automatic tracking and data collection in response to a Do Not Track signal or request. We believe we can offer customers a more personalized experience when visiting our website when we are able to retrieve data from a customer’s previous activity on our website. We do share anonymous traffic and transactional information with our affiliates and service providers on an aggregate basis for marketing, accounting and site-optimization purposes. 

### Non-public personal information

NPPI includes: (i) any information you provide to obtain a financial product or service; (ii) about you resulting from any transaction involving a financial product or service; or (iii) that we otherwise obtain about you in connection with providing a financial product or service that you request. This type of information does not include information that is collected anonymously or for the purpose of tracking movement on our website. In order for you to access many of the products and services offered through this site, you will be required to provide us with NPPI such as:

  * Name;
  * Street or postal address;

For example, we may provide your contact information to our service providers for direct emailing of our newsletters or to provide you with notifications of our product/service offerings via email, phone or text message. 

Selected NPPI, such as your Social Security number, driver’s license number, bank account or routing number, and debit or credit card numbers, expiration dates and security codes are immediately encrypted.

### Terms Used in This Statement

  


#### Cookies

Credit.com uses cookies, or small text files maintained by your web browser, to enhance your interaction with the website. Some cookies are stored on your hard drive. You may reject or refuse cookies and still visit our web site. However if you reject cookies you may not be able to access all of the services on our web site. 

Some of the companies that offer products or services via our web sites, and some of the companies that send visitors to our web site pass cookies to your computer. Please be aware that we have no control over cookies passed to you from other companies’ sites. 

If you request information or purchase a product or service, you will be requested to enter NPPI on our web site. Selected NPPI is linked to the cookie stored on your computer so it will be easier for you to complete a transaction on your next visit to our web site. If you complete another transaction, you may have to re-enter selected NPPI which is not linked to cookies stored on your computer. 

#### Encryption

Credit.com uses encryption to secure selected NPPI such as Social Security numbers, drivers license numbers, and credit card data. Encryption is a way to scramble data to make it unreadable to anyone other than the intended recipient. If it is intercepted by a third-party while traveling over a network it cannot be read. Only the persons sending and receiving the encrypted data have a key to unscramble the data and make it readable. Encryption provides privacy for email, discussion group postings, and other communications as they move over networks. Credit.com uses industry standard SSL, AES and RSA encryption. 

#### Secure Sockets Layer

Secure Sockets Layer is the industry standard method for protecting web site communications by encrypting information thus making it unreadable to anyone except the holders of the keys used to read the information. Credit.com uses the SSL protocol to capture selected NPPI, such as your credit card numbers via the Internet. 

#### SSL Certificate

A SSL Certificate binds an entity to a pair of electronic keys that can be used to encrypt and sign digital information. A SSL Certificate makes it possible for you to verify that we have the right to use a given key, helping to prevent others from using phony keys to impersonate us. For more information about our certificate, click on the VeriSign® logo. 

#### Third Data Sources

We use third-parties to verify the integrity of selected NPPI you provide so we can confirm your identity. 

#### Web-beacons

  * Track and account for transactional information on the websites of non-affiliated third-parties or service providers;
  * Collect aggregate transactional data for accounting purposes;
  * Track statistics about: 
    * The IP address of the computer that fetched the web beacon
    * The URL of the page that the web Beacon is located on
    * The URL of the web beacon
