# credit.com: privacy

The web site you entered is operated by Credit.Com, Inc. ("Credit.Com"), which values your patronage and the trust you place in the company and its personnel. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information that are collected by Credit.Com on its web sites and how Credit.Com uses and protects it. This policy applies only to Credit.Com and to web sites operated by or on behalf of Credit.Com. It does not apply to web sites that are owned by third parties, including web sites that link to Credit.Com or that are linked from this web site (including web sites of lenders and others that have business relationships with Credit.Com to provide loans and other consumer credit products and services to you). Credit.Com is not responsible for the privacy practices of those third party web sites, which may differ from ours in significant ways. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those web sites and the companies that operate them.

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Please check this Privacy Policy each time you use this web site in order to have the most current information on this topic. 

  
Credit.Com is a California-based company and strongly supports the inalienable right of privacy guaranteed to all people by the California Constitution. While you may not be protected by the California Constitution, and although Credit.Com is not a "financial institution" and therefore is not governed by the California Financial Information Privacy Act (Sections 4050 et seq. of the California Financial Code, commonly referred to as "S.B. 1"), Credit.Com nonetheless is firmly committed to protecting your personal privacy. As part of that commitment, we communicate this Privacy Policy to every Credit.Com employee, and we require that each Credit.Com employee follow it. In addition, employee access to information about individual customers is limited to those authorized employees with a legitimate business reason to access the information, and then only on a "need-to-know" basis.

Among its operations, Credit.Com functions as a consumer credit intermediary, linking consumers with various consumer credit products and services. If you are applying for any of those products or services, Credit.Com may collect the personal information you provide us to enroll you as a customer or to complete a transaction. In these circumstances, however, our principal role is to facilitate a relationship in which you provide your information directly to a third party \- for instance, to apply for extension of credit, or to purchase a credit report or other credit-related products or services - rather than to us. We collect information as a consumer credit intermediary to enable us to:

  * Transmit the information to a third-party lender or service provider (subscribers) who process or provide applications for the product or service you request.  

  * Communicate with you about your applications for products or services.  

  * Confirm the acceptance and status of your request by e-mail.  

  * Respond to your inquiries about the status and/or destination of your applications.  

  * Identify the referring web site if you link to us from another web site.  

  * Delete fictitious data from our systems, based on a customer identifier such as a home telephone number or e-mail address.  

  * Handle accounting issues between us and our subscribers and affiliates, using a customer identifier such as a home telephone number or e-mail address, if the subscriber rejects your application.  

  * Conduct market and demographic analyses on aggregated customer data, which does not identify individual customers.  

  * Perform system and security monitoring, such as monitoring the IP addresses of incoming traffic to prevent abuse.



Credit.Com also provides consumer credit education services. To do so, we may collect your name and your e-mail address to enable us, if you desire, to send you e-mail newsletters and other information about our consumer education services and other programs.

In each of these circumstances, we will only collect and use the minimum information needed to accomplish the stated purpose, and only with your full knowledge and consent.

We keep individual page view information in our log files for 90 days to enable us to better respond to the interests of each customer and for system and security monitoring. We keep aggregated page view data indefinitely.

We indefinitely keep information about you that is not personally identifiable financial information - information such as your name, your e-mail address, the products or services you order through our web site, and your answers to multiple choice questions - to enable us to communicate with you and for our internal analysis of the demographics of our customers. We give you the ability to opt out of future contact from us at any time.

We keep personally identifiable financial information about you that you furnish to us during your visit to our web site - information such as your Social Security account number, a bank account number, a credit card number, your mother's maiden name, and/or your drivers license number - to facilitate the completion of your transaction. We permanently delete this information from our systems after four business days.

Credit.Com uses Secure Sockets Layer technology supporting up to 128-bit encryption to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing or tampering with any personal information transmitted to or from Credit.Com during your session. Secure Sockets Layer server authentication allows your browser to confirm a server's identity.

Credit.Com is registered with VeriSign®, the best-known certificate authority, and has obtained digital certificates from VeriSign® for www.credit.com and its subdomains and affiliated domains.

When you provide Credit.Com with personal information, you do so over Secure Sockets Layer technology using a secure encrypted link between the computer you are using and our servers. When we transmit your personal information to the provider of the product or service you are ordering, we also do so over Secure Sockets Layer technology . Credit.Com safeguards information about you in our possession according to established physical and electronic security procedures designed to prevent unauthorized access. We continually assess new information protection technology.

Credit.Com does not provide your personally identifiable information to affiliated or unaffiliated companies for their independent use, except when we transmit the information to subscribers who process or provide applications for the product or service you request. 

Credit.Com may legally disclose your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties when the law requires our cooperation \- for example, in response to a search warrant issued in connection with a fraud investigation, in response to a subpoena, or in response to a request by an authorized government regulator. If possible, we will attempt to comply with any legal request for our cooperation by eliminating all personally identifiable information before releasing our records. If that is not possible, before we provide your personally identifiable information to a third party as required by law, we will seek the issuance of a protective order by a court of competent jurisdiction compelling the third party to maintain the confidentiality of that information.
