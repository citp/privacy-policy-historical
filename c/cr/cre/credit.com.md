Credit.com is dedicated to protecting the privacy of our customers.

Credit.com Inc. has received TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal. The TRUSTe program does not cover information that may be collected through downloadable software. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this website, www.credit.com.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe [here](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request).

### What information we collect and how we collect it.

We collect the following categories of NPPI: (i) information you provide, such as your contact information; (ii) information about your transactions with us or our affiliates; (iii) information about your transactions with unaffiliated third-parties to whom your information is disclosed by us to fulfill a transaction you request, such as obtaining a personal loan or credit card; and (iv) information obtained from any consumer reporting agency, such as your credit history.

### Non-public personal information

NPPI includes any information: (i) you provide to obtain a financial product or service; (ii) about you resulting from any transaction involving a financial product or service; or (iii) that we otherwise obtain about you in connection with providing a financial product or service that you request. This type of information does not include information that is collected anonymously or for the purpose of tracking movement on our website. In order for you to access many of the products and services offered through this site, you may be required to provide us with NPPI, such as:

  * Name;
  * Street or postal address;
  * E-mail address;
  * Phone number;
  * Your place of employment, employer, length of time you worked there;
  * Number of years you lived in your home or other information about your home;
  * Loan purpose and loan amount;
  * Social Security number;
  * Date of birth;
  * Debit or credit card number, expiration date and security code.



This information is used to identify you, complete your requests for financial products or services, facilitate requests for other products or services, and for customer service fulfillment.

### Traffic data

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. Though we may link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you, we will not share any of this automatically collected data.

No NPPI that identifies a customer or former customer is revealed in the collection and use of traffic data. Consequently, we do not adjust or alter our website's automatic tracking and data collection in response to a Do Not Track signal or request. We believe we can offer customers a more personalized experience when visiting our website when we are able to retrieve data from a customer's previous activity on our website. We do share anonymous traffic and transactional information with our affiliates and service providers on an aggregate basis for marketing, accounting and site-optimization purposes.

### Categories of information we disclose

Credit.com may disclose the NPPI we collect about you, described above, to our affiliates or unaffiliated third-parties, as described below, and as otherwise permitted by law.

> (i) To financial institutions and other lenders or other service providers in order to fulfill or respond to your request for credit or other services we offer or to otherwise contact you with information about their products or services. When a financial institution contacts you, its use of your information is subject to its privacy policy and not ours; and
> 
> (ii) To affiliates and service providers that perform professional services for us, such as demographic analysis for marketing purposes and accounting or assistance with marketing, advertising, product/service offerings and customer service fulfillment. These companies are authorized to use your NPPI only as necessary to provide these services to us. For example, we may provide your contact information to our service providers for direct emailing of our newsletters or to provide you with notifications of our product/service offerings via email, phone or text message.

Selected NPPI, such as your Social Security number and debit or credit card numbers, expiration dates and security codes are immediately encrypted.

Credit.com does not sell, rent or otherwise disclose your NPPI to third parties except as explained in this privacy policy and as permitted by law.

We may share aggregated information (i.e., collective information about you and other customers, but not specifically identifiable to you) and other deidentified or anonymous information we collect with third parties.

### Why we need your e-mail address

We use your e-mail address to:

  * Confirm your identity;
  * Send you information on the status of your transaction;
  * Contact you if we need your assistance to complete the transaction;
  * Send you newsletters, and other customer related material as permitted by law.



Credit.com has a zero tolerance policy for e-mail abuse. If you receive unsolicited e-mails from Credit.com, please report it to us at [http://support.credit.com](http://support.credit.com/). We are not responsible for communications you may receive from unaffiliated third-parties.

We will never ask you to provide NPPI in an e-mail. DO NOT RESPOND to an e-mail that appears to be from us requesting NPPI. Contact us immediately at [http://support.credit.com](http://support.credit.com/).

If you contact us by e-mail, we will respond by e-mail.

### What choices you have regarding the use of your information

**E-mail correspondence.** You may opt out of receiving e-mails from us in one of two ways:

  1. If you subscribe to the service online, you may "uncheck" the box next to the offer on the online form you complete; or
  2. Click on the 'unsubscribe' link in the e-mail you receive.



When you unsubscribe, you will receive an e-mail confirming your decision to opt out.

**Confirmations.** You may not opt out of confirmation e-mail messages and messages that are part of the service to which you are subscribed. They are designed to confirm your identity and your decision to enter into a transaction. Confirmation e-mails often contain important instructions about your transaction. If you do not wish to receive confirmation e-mails, do not sign up for services or products on this website.

### Your access to identifying NPPI

If you want to delete your identifying NPPI, including your e-mail address, or if you no longer are interested in a service found on this website, you may request deletion of your identifying NPPI or deactivation by contacting customer service at [http://support.credit.com](http://support.credit.com/). We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. In the event that certain information cannot be deleted (because, for example, the information is being retained to document compliance or to ensure that Credit.com can enforce its legal rights), we may not delete such information. Information entered on the Credit.com website will be automatically updated each time you apply for a new or different service. In addition, we will deactivate your account when you send such a request to [http://support.credit.com](http://support.credit.com/). Please note that deactivation of your account will not necessarily result in the deletion of your NPPI.

### Credit.com reserves the right to disclose your NPPI, including your e-mail address, without notice or your consent:

  1. To comply with federal, state or local laws, rules and other applicable legal requirements; or
  2. To comply with a properly authorized civil, criminal, or regulatory investigation, or subpoena or summons by federal, state or local authorities; or
  3. To respond to judicial process or government regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over Credit.com for examination, compliance, other purposes as authorized by law; or
  4. To enforce our Terms of Service; or
  5. To permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; or
  6. To our service providers to verify the integrity of the information collected; or
  7. To our affiliated business partners for accounting purposes; or
  8. For any other purpose permitted by applicable law.



### Business Transitions

If Credit.com is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your NPPI or other information may be disclosed to third parties concerned or their professional advisors. In the event of such a transaction, the NPPI held by Credit.com will be among the assets transferred to the buyer.

### Important note regarding non-U.S. users and U.S. law

The laws and regulations of different countries and states impose different requirements on data protections and the use of the Internet. Credit.com is located in California, in the United States of America, as are the servers that make this website available worldwide. The laws of the State of California and the United States of America govern all matters relating to this website. If you provide information while using this website, you will be deemed to have authorized the transfer of your information to our servers in California.

### Children

We do not knowingly solicit information from children or send them requests for information. Although there are links to other websites that may offer services to persons under the age of 18, Credit.com does not offer any services for person under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you may browse our website, but you may not provide personal information to us (such as name, address, or e-mail address), and you may not register for, enroll in, and/or purchase and product or service.

### This privacy policy applies to www.credit.com

This privacy policy applies only to the website http://www.credit.com and the users of the website.

Credit.com is not responsible for the privacy practices on any other website or of any other entity or person. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of any website you visit and the companies that operate them.

### Social Media

Our website offers publicly accessible blogs and/or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.

You have the option to post comments on our blog page through a third-party platform. These platforms are managed by a third-party application that may require you to register to post a comment. We do not have access or control of the information posted to the blog. You will need to contact or login into the third-party application if you want the personal information that was posted to the comments section removed. To learn how the third-party application uses your information, please review its privacy policy.

Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and Widgets, such as the Share button or interactive mini-programs that run on our website. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our website and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.

### Privacy policies and unaffiliated third-parties

We do not permit third parties to collect NPPI on our website, but our website does include links to third-party websites, services and products, and when you link to a third-party website, the third- party website's privacy policy applies. In addition, you authorize us to provide your NPPI to unaffiliated third parties (including, without limitation, CSIdentity Corporation) when you request a financial product or service offered by a third party.

Because this privacy policy applies only to the Credit.com website, it may be different from the privacy policies of the unaffiliated third parties to whom your NPPI is disclosed to process the financial product or service you request or authorize. Credit.com urges you to review the privacy policies of every website you visit where you are required to disclose your NPPI to obtain a product or service.

### Security

Credit.com is a VeriSign® secured website and uses a VeriSign® SSL Certificate for encryption. Customer data is securely transmitted by Credit.com to unaffiliated third parties as permitted by this privacy policy or by law and to service providers through a combination of encryption techniques and other privacy protection measures. Selected NPPI submitted through the Credit.com website, such as your Social Security number or payment card data, are encrypted.

Credit.com also maintains and enforces strict internal policies to protect NPPI from unauthorized access by employees or third parties. When you submit information to Credit.com through our website, you should be aware that your information is transmitted across the Internet and that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Although we take reasonable security measures to protect your information when we receive it, you also need to ensure you take appropriate steps to protect your information. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at [http://support.credit.com](http://support.credit.com/). If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please notify us of the problem as soon as possible by contacting us in accordance with the "Contact us" section above (note that if you choose to notify us via physical mail, this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem).

### Tracking Technologies

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Credit.com and our partners (e.g., email service providers), affiliates, or analytics or service providers (e.g., online customer support providers). These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the website, tracking users' movements around the website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual, as well as aggregate, basis.

We use cookies to remember users' settings (e.g., language preference), for authentication, and to track and manage marketing. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our website, but your ability to use some features or areas of our website may be limited.

### Behavioral Targeting

We partner with third-party advertising networks to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other websites. Our network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.

Please note this does not opt you out of being sent advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

### Terms Used in This Statement

  


#### Encryption

Credit.com uses encryption to secure selected NPPI such as Social Security number and payment card data. Encryption is a way to scramble data to make it unreadable to anyone other than the intended recipient. If it is intercepted by a third party while traveling over a network, it cannot be read. Only the persons sending and receiving the encrypted data have a key to unscramble the data and make it readable. Credit.com uses industry standard SSL, AES and RSA encryption.

#### Secure Sockets Layer

Secure Sockets Layer is the industry standard method for protecting website communications by encrypting information, thus making it unreadable to anyone except the holders of the keys used to read the information. Credit.com uses the SSL protocol to capture selected NPPI, such as your credit card numbers, via the Internet.

#### SSL Certificate

A SSL Certificate binds an entity to a pair of electronic keys that can be used to encrypt and sign digital information. A SSL Certificate makes it possible for you to verify that we have the right to use a given key, helping to prevent others from using phony keys to impersonate us. For more information about our certificate, click on the VeriSign® logo.

#### Third-Party Data Sources

We use third parties to verify the integrity of selected NPPI you provide so we can confirm your identity.
