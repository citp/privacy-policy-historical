    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>It is CreateForLess' policy to respect and protect the privacy
of our customers and the users of the CreateForLess site. We
understand and share your concern about privacy. Through this
Internet Privacy Statement, we want to reassure users of the Site
that we will not sell, share, or rent user information to others in
a manner different than as set forth in this Internet Privacy
Statement.</p>

<p><strong>Security Information and Secure Ordering</strong><br>
Strong precautions are taken to protect the information of the
users of our Site. When users submit sensitive information via the
Site, that Information is protected both online and off-line.</p>

<p>We take credit card information security seriously and use a
variety of technical solutions to make shopping safe at our Site.
Furthermore, your information and is protected utilizing the
industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption software.
The information you send us is encrypted on your computer, sent
through the Internet as jumbled code, and decoded at CreateForLess'
secure site. While on a secure page, such as our Order Detail page,
the lock icon appears on the bottom of your Web browser, such as
Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. The lock
appears closed, as opposed to un-locked, or open, as it is shown
when you are just 'surfing'.</p>

<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information
online, we also protect user information off-line. All of the
information of our Site's users, including the sensitive
information for ordering, is maintained in a restricted area.
CreateForLess employs the latest security measures to protect
against the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our
control. Servers are housed in a secure location behind firewalls,
and we restrict the number of CreateForLess employees who can
access personal data. Furthermore, our employees are kept
up-to-date on our security and privacy practices</p>

<p><strong>Placing Orders and Information Collection</strong><br>
CreateForLess will not collect or retain any information about you
personally (such as, your name, address, telephone number, or

collect information from the CreateForLess Website in several ways.
If you register for an online account, we will ask you for personal
information including your name, zip code, e-mail address and phone
number. This personal information will be stored in your personal
profile. Once you have submitted this information and chosen both a
valid username and password, you will be able to take full
advantage of using the CreateForLess Website. When you make a
purchase from the CreateForLess Website, we will also ask for your
credit card information, as well as, billing and shipping
information. We will send out confirming e-mails whenever you make
a purchase, to inform you that we received your personal
information or to confirm your purchase.</p>

<p><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong><br>
CreateForLess will send personally identifiable information about
you to other companies or people when:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have your consent to share the information;</li>

<li>We need to share your information to provide the product or
service you have requested;</li>

<li>We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf

the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond
what is necessary to assist us.);</li>

<li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or</li>

<li>We find that your actions on our web sites violate the
CreateForLess Terms and Conditions, or any of our usage guidelines
for specific products or services.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do provide us with personal information, we may retain
information about your previous purchases of CreateForLess products
in order to customize our Website services for your future visits
to the site. Second, we may use your e-mail address to send you
updates about new products, specials and other items of interest.
If you have already submitted this information and would like to

profile. However, if you made a purchase, we will need to retain
certain information for billing and shipping purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Opting out</strong><br>

information provided may also be used for the following: to
communicate new products, specials and other items of interest from

for any reason, or no reason at all, you may opt to remove your
personal information from our database by unsubscribing to any
e-mail you may receive from CreateForLess, or by sending an e-mail
request to <a href="mailto:info@CreateForLess.com">info@CreateForLess.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Links to External and Co-Branded Websites</strong><br>
We cannot ensure the protection of any personal information that
you provide to a third-party site that links to or from the
CreateForLess Website, since these third-party sites are owned and
operated independently. These third-party sites may have their
separate privacy and data collection practices that are beyond our
control. Any personal information that you provide to these
third-party sites will be regulated by their privacy policy, if
any. CreateForLess can assume no responsibility or liability
whatsoever for the practices, actions or policies of these
third-party sites, and cannot be responsible for the content or
privacy practices of such sites.</p>

Statement. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use
the CreateForLess Website. CreateForLess reserves the right to
change this policy at any time. Your continued use of the
CreateForLess Website following the posting of changes to our
Privacy Policy will signify your acceptance of those changes</p>

<p><strong>Surveys &amp; Contests</strong><br>
From time-to-time we may request information from the users of the
Site via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or
contests is completely voluntary, and the users of the Site have a
choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information
requested may include contact information (such as your name and
shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code,
age level, etc.). We use such information to notify contest
winners, award prizes, and for analyzing the Site traffic to
improve the user's experience on the Site.</p>

<p><a id="Cookies" name="Cookies" title="Cookies"></a><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
You may have heard of the term "cookies". Cookies are routinely
used by most, if not all, E- commerce merchants, including
CreateForLess. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's hard
drive through the Web browser program containing information about
the user which enables us to track and personalize the Site to
enhance your experience. For instance, by setting a cookie on our
Site, we can provide you with storage of items in your shopping
cart between visits. However, if a user rejects the cookie, they
may still use our Site although we will be unable to provide our
users with the personalized shopping experience we can offer using
the cookie data. CreateForLess does not use cookies, or other
nonconsensual methods, to take personally identifiable or online
contact information about specific users. If you have any questions
about our use of cookies, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@CreateForLess.com">info@CreateForLess.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Special Offers, Account Updates and Opting
Out</strong><br>
CreateForLess occasionally sends our customers and the users of the
Site announcements and updates, which contain important information
about the Site and service offerings which we believe to be of
value to our customers and users. In order to do this, we may
enhance or merge the information we collect on the Site with data
from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services
to our customers and users.</p>

<p>We may communicate with the users of the Site via e-mail,
telephone, mail, or fax in order to provide requested services,
content, product information, notification of special offers, or in
regard to customer service issues relating to an account. The users
of the Site are always given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having
their online information used for purposes not directly related to
the Site. This option is available when we ask for the information
or when the user receives an online requested promotional
communication.</p>

<p>For example, our e-mail messages have an "unsubscribe" feature
for users of the Site who buy from us, but don't want to be
notified about special offers in the future. Users can simply
"Reply" back to the e-mail message and type "unsubscribe" in the
subject field. Upon receipt of the reply, CreateForLess will remove
that e-mail address from our e-mail list. If a user has more than
one e- mail address, he or she should include the other addresses
as well to ensure proper updating of their account information.</p>

<p>Users of the Site can always update the personally identifying
information that they have provided to CreateForLess simply by
accessing and updating their account information on the Site or by
e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:info@createforless.com">info@createforless.com</a>.</p>

<p>At CreateForLess, your privacy and security are very important
to us. If you have any questions about our policies, the practices
of our site, or your dealings with CreateForLess, please e-mail us
at <a href="mailto:info@createforless.com">info@createforless.com</a>.</p>
