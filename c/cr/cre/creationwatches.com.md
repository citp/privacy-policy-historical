This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer containing information about the user. Cookies are used throughout our sites for enhancement of the user experience. Some parts of our site may not work without cookies turned on, other parts will function as normal. 

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

 **Sharing**

We use outside shipping companies to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we may share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services (For e.g. shipping by FedEx or UPS). These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

**Newsletter**

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletters, we ask for contact information such as email address.
