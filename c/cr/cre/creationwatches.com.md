**1.2. Justification, implementation and / or termination of a contract**

**1.2.1. Data processing on conclusion of the contract**

If you register with Redsol Pte Ltd. or one of our Apps, or buy a product from our website, we will process the data necessary to successfully conclude the transaction. This includes:

The legal basis for collecting the above information is Article 6 (1) (a) and (b) GDPR.

So long as we do not use your data for advertising purposes (see below 1.3.), 1e store the data collected for the execution of the purchase. The duration of such storage is dictated by necessity e.g. statutory or potential contractual warranty and guarantee rights.

Information such as your delivery address, email and telephone number is passed on to our logistics and shipping partners so that they can send you (and us) intimation once the product is shipped and expected date of delivery.

The logistics partner(s) may contact you to ascertain suitable time of delivery.

**1.2.2. Creditworthiness and transmission to credit bureaus**

Redsol Pte Ltd. generally grants its customers the option of purchasing goods using insecure payment methods.

Generally speaking, there are two types of payment mechanism offered:  
Secure, online and,  
Non-secure offline

To protect our business interests, Redsol Pte Ltd. might in certain instances, check the creditworthiness of its customer before granting the option of using insecure payment methods.

Within this framework, Redsol Pte Ltd. is entitled to use negative credit information, which it has collected for the respective customer. Furthermore, Redsol Pte Ltd. is entitled to provide negative credit information about the respective customer to the other business associates of Redsol Pte Ltd. This is done in order to minimize the prospect of losses on account of fraud.

In cases where a customer opts to use insecure means of payment, Redsol Pte Ltd. is entitled to use credit information obtained in the order to calculate probability of non-payment and fraud. This calculation is done via internal scoring and is based on a recognized mathematical statistical procedure. In particular, the data used in internal scoring results from a combination of the following data categories: address data, age, desired payment terms, order path, and assortment groups. As part of the internal scoring, only such data are used, which the customer has indicated to us. As part of the examination of whether an insecure payment method can be granted, we are also entitled to obtain credit information about you from an external credit agency. For the purpose of soliciting credit information, the following information is transmitted to the external credit reporting agency: first name, last name, postal address, date of birth.

As part of the credit check, we can decide by means of an automated process whether you are granted the desired insecure payment method (instalment / invoice payment). For example, when submitting a negative credit report by an information agency or when calculating an insufficient score within the scope of the internal scoring, a rejection of the desired payment method can be carried out automatically. You can assert the right for us to make a manual review of the automated decision. In addition, you have the right to make your own views and to challenge the decision.

The processing of your data as part of the credit check is carried out on the basis of Article 6 (1) (b) DSGVO and Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. In principle, we have a legitimate interest in the execution of a credit check when selecting an insecure payment method (instalment / invoice purchase) by you.

**1.2.3. Use of data for fraud prevention purposes**

The information you provide in the context of an order can be used to verify that there is an atypical ordering process (for example, simultaneous ordering of a large number of goods to the same address using different customer accounts). In principle, there is a legitimate interest in the performance of such a review. The legal basis of the processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

**1.2.4. Transmission of data to transport**

Service providers for the purpose of delivering ordered goods, we work together with logistics service providers / transport companies and / or shipping partners: to these the following data may be transmitted for the purpose of delivering the ordered goods or for their announcement: first name, last name, postal address, E-mail address, telephone number (e.g. for forwarding announcements). The legal basis of the processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR.

**1.2.5. Transmission of data on outstanding claims to collection service providers**

If you fail to settle outstanding invoices / instalments despite a repeated reminder, we may forward the data required for the performance of collection to a debt collection agency for the purpose of fiduciary collection. Alternatively, we can sell the outstanding claims to a debt collection agency. He then becomes the debtor and claims in his own name. Redsol Pte Ltd. may cooperate with contracted debt collection service provider. The legal basis for the transfer of data in the context of fiduciary collection is Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR; the transmission of data in connection with the sale of receivables is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

**1.2.6. Transmission of data to partner companies**

You have the opportunity to use third-party offers on our platform. In these cases, you may conclude a contract directly with our partner to whom the data required for the performance of the contract (eg first name, last name, billing and delivery address, e-mail address, billing and payment data, date of birth, telephone number) are transmitted. Such advantages offered by our partners are recognizable as partner offers. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6 (1) (b), (f) GDPR.

**1.2.6.2. Items from other sellers**

In order to offer our customers an even larger and more attractive selection, Redsol Pte Ltd. cooperates with selected partners who offer their products and services on their own behalf and for their own account at Redsol Pte Ltd. online portal.

If you order a partner article, a contract may only be concluded between you and the partner. When ordering such an article the general terms and conditions and possibly the privacy policy of the partner apply. The general terms and conditions and privacy policy of the partner may in individual cases deviate from the general terms and conditions of Redsol Pte Ltd. . By sending your order or - for example, in the case of processing special categories of personal data (Article 9 GDPR) by express consent - you accept the privacy policy of the partner. In this case, Redsol Pte Ltd. is not your contractual partner and, with regard to the processing of the data by the partner, is not responsible for the data protection law.

If you order several articles from different partners and Redsol Pte Ltd. , the respective terms and conditions and privacy policy of each seller apply to each article. Your data necessary for the transaction (first name, name, address, date of birth, telephone number and e-mail address) will be stored by Redsol Pte Ltd. and passed on to our partner for their own fulfilment of the contract. This may use your e-mail address for sending information about your order.

These e-mails are often based on the Redsol Pte Ltd. brand layout and may be difficult to distinguish from genuine e-mails from Redsol Pte Ltd.

The fraudsters want to exploit the trust between Redsol Pte Ltd. and our customers and thereby steal sensitive data (e.g. login, customer information, payment information) or install malicious software (such as viruses or Trojans) on your computer or smartphone.

The creation of these e-mails and the shipping will not be done by Redsol Pte Ltd. , even if our name should be used as sender. Unfortunately, Redsol Pte Ltd. cannot influence the sending of these illegal e-mails.

Here are some features that help you recognize emails from Redsol Pte Ltd.:
