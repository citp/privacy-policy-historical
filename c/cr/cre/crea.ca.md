THE CANADIAN REAL ESTATE ASSOCIATION  
Policy On the Collection, Use and Disclosure  
Of Personal Information  
"Privacy Policy"

**BACKGROUND**

The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) is a national trade Association representing some 103 Real Estate Boards, 10 Provincial Real Estate Associations, one Territorial Association and all licensed brokers and salespersons (REALTORS) who are Members of those organizations. CREA's mission is to represent and promote the interests of its Members, enhance Member professionalism and ability to succeed, and advocates policies that ensure real estate property rights and ownership. 

THE PRIVACY CODE OF THE CANADIAN REAL ESTATE ASSOCIATION

In 2001, the members of The Canadian Real Estate Association approved the adoption of a national Privacy Code. This Code, which applies to all member Boards, Associations, brokerage firms, brokers and salespersons, is comprised of the 10 Principles of privacy, which set in place a solid foundation within which the REALTOR community can protect the confidentiality of the Personal Information of its customers, clients and the general public. 

CREA adheres to and abides by the Principles set out in the Privacy Code. 

Those Principles have been incorporated into this Policy, which is intended to outline CREA's practices with regard to the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information. 

DEFINITIONS

For the purpose of this Policy: 

**_"Personal Information"_** means any information about an identifiable individual but does not include: 

  1. The name, title, business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization; 
  2. Aggregated information that cannot be associated with a specific individual. 



**_"Member"_** ****includes, for the purpose of this Policy, licensed brokers and salespersons belonging to member Boards/Associations and individuals belonging either directly to CREA or to Councils of CREA. ****

COLLECTION, USE & DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 

**COLLECTION

CREA may collect Personal Information of Members directly from the member. Personal Information may also be provided to CREA by the Board/Association, which is collected at the time of the individual's application for membership. CREA's Privacy Code requires that the collection of such information by the Board/Association be done with the informed consent of the individual. 

Information on properties listed for sale on MLS® systems may be provided to CREA by Boards/Associations for display on CREA's property database websites. This information is collected by the listing salesperson, and may be Personal Information if it can be associated with an individual. 

**USE & DISCLOSURE  
**CREA uses the Personal Information provided to it for various purposes, all of which are intended to fulfill its obligations as a national trade association and further its mission statement. These purposes include:

**DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES  
**Certain Personal Information of Members, (name, licensed status, firm name and business contact information) is available to other Members of CREA through REALTOR LinkT, a password-protected Intranet site. CREA may also disclose personal information of members to Boards/Associations or real estate regulators for membership or related purposes. 

CREA may also disclose Personal Information of Members to third parties, such as lawyers, consultants, affinity partners or others who work with CREA to collect and analyse information from Members, to improve the products and services offered by CREA or to provide products and services to Members. Some of these third parties may send information to or contact the individual as part of membership surveys. 

Personal Information may only be provided to organizations providing services to CREA if they agree to use such information solely for the purposes of providing services to CREA and under the instruction of CREA and, with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with this Policy. 

CONSENT 

**By providing Personal Information to CREA, the individual is consenting to its collection, use and disclosure in accordance with this Privacy Policy.**

Consent to the collection and certain uses of the information may be refused or withdrawn by the individual subject to legal or contractual requirements. In that circumstance, CREA may not be able to offer certain information or services to the individual. ****

**USE AND DISCLOSURE WITHOUT CONSENT  
**In certain circumstances, CREA may be permitted or required by law to disclose Personal Information without consent. Those circumstances may include; 

  * Where the information was public; 
  * Where required by law; 
  * Where it is necessary to collect dues; 
  * Where it is necessary to protect the rights of an identifiable person or group; 
  * Other circumstances recognized by the privacy legislation as permitting disclosure without consent. 

PROTECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION 

CREA takes reasonable steps to protect information from unauthorized access or disclosure in a manner commensurate with its sensitivity, value and criticality. This Policy applies regardless of the media on which the information is stored, the location where the information is stored, the systems used to process the information or the processes by which information is handled. 

The measures used to protect Personal Information include physical measures (e.g. locked filing cabinets), organizational measures (e.g. information is available to other persons only on a need-to-know-basis) and technological measures (e.g. computer passwords). 

While CREA puts in place reasonable precautions, we cannot guarantee at all times the security of the information. No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure, particularly with regard to Internet applications. 

ACCURACY 

CREA attempts to insure the Personal Information under its control is as accurate, complete, current and relevant as is necessary for its identified purpose. 

Personal Information of Members which is uploaded directly to CREA's database by Member Boards/Associations is the responsibility of the Member and or the Boards/Associations. 

Listing information uploaded by the Boards/Associations to CREA's property database websites is the responsibility of the listing REALTOR and/or the Board/Association. 

Information in closed files is not updated or maintained. 

RETENTION
