If you decide to place an order, we will also need to know   your delivery and billing address, credit card number and expiration date. If   you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information   from you, please do not provide us with any such information.<br>
  <br>
                  When you   submit your personally identifiable information on the Site, you are giving your   consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as   set forth in this Privacy Policy. <br>
