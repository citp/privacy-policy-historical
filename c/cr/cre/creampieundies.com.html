        Privacy Policy applies to the following website: www.creampieundies.com 
        (“Site”).</h2>
We are committed to protecting your privacy. The following information 
        is designed to help you understand how we collect, use, disseminate 
        and safeguard the information you provide to us while accessing 
        and using our Sites. By accessing and using our Sites, you signify 
        your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our 
        information practices, please do not access or use our Sites. As 
        provided below, we reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, 
        add or remove portions of this policy at any time by posting such 
        changes to this page. Such changes will be effective upon posting.
        
        <h2>Information Collection and Use:</h2>
We are the sole owner of the information collected on the Sites. 
        We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways 
        different from what is disclosed in this statement. We collect information 
        from our users at several different points throughout our Sites.
        
        <h2>Registration and Order Forms:</h2>
In order to gain access to our Site, you may be requested to provide 
        us with your date of birth. In addition, in order to purchase goods 
        and services from our Sites, or to become a member of our Sites, 
        a user must complete the on-line registration/order form. During 
        registration, a user is required to provide us with certain contact 
        information (which may include your name, mailing address, phone 
        number, fax number, and e-mail address). This information is used to set-up and maintain an account, 
        verify credit card details and validate credit identity. If we have 
        trouble processing an order or otherwise need to contact a user, 
        the contact information is used to get in touch with the user. From 
        time to time, we may also ask that you provide us with additional 
        information so that we can better tailor our services to meet your 
        needs.

        containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no 
        way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our

        <h2>Profiling:</h2>
From time to time, we may combine personal information and preferences

        may contract with another party to provide certain specific services 
        to our users. If we have collected your personally identifiable

  If we decide to use your personally identifiable information in 
  a manner materially different from that stated in the Privacy 
  Policy at the time that such information was collected, we will 
  attempt to notify you of such changes. You agree that if we send 
  you an e-mail to the e-mail address reflected in our records, 
  such e-mail will constitute acceptable notice to you of the change 
  in our policy. The notice will provide you with an opportunity 
  to “opt-out” so that we may not use your personally 
  identifiable information in a manner which is different from the 
  manner described at the time that you provided us with such information. 
  If you do not affirmatively “opt-out” pursuant to the 
  instructions provided to you in the notice, then you agree that 
  we may use your personally identifiable information in the manner 
  described in the notice. (If we have no e-mail address for you, 
  or if we do not have a current e-mail address for you, then you 
  agree that adequate notice of the change in our policy will be 
  effected by posting such a change onto our Privacy Policy, which 
  shall also disclose information about how you may “opt-out” 
  so that we may not use your personally identifiable information 
  in a manner which is materially different from the manner described 
  at the time that you provided us with such information. If you 
  do not affirmatively “opt-out” pursuant to the instructions 
  posted within the time period specified, then you agree that we 
  may use your personally identifiable information as described 
  in the posted notice).

  otherwise need to contact us regarding your personally identifiable 
  information, please contact us by sending an e-mail. Please provide
