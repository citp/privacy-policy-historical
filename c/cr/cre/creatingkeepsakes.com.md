**Creative Crafts Group** **Privacy Policy**

Creative Crafts Group respects your privacy, and is committed to providing a safe online experience for our users. Since we request personal information for many of our online features, this policy summarizes the types of information we will collect and how it will be used.

While you are free to visit our websites, read selected articles, and use selected features without providing any personal information, we may collect information such as your name and email address as you register on one of our sites or sign up for one of our newsletters. This information is voluntarily supplied, but may be required to participate in our message boards or to take advantage of special offers.

We may also collect general information such as type of browser you use, your IP address, the files you request, the domain name you use, etc. This information is used to improve our website and better meet the needs of our viewers. Some of our web pages may contain “cookies,” which are sent to your computer to store data. This allows our servers to “recognize” you when you visit our sites in the future and provide you with better services. Most web browsers can be configured to not accept cookies if you choose to disable them. However if you disable cookies, some advanced features will not be available to you.

The information collected is used to better serve you and improve our services. We use this information to track orders, respond to your inquiries, welcome you to our sites, and to gauge user trends. We will not sell your information to third parties without your permission. We may provide general information and statistics, such as click-through rates and user trends, to advertisers, but we will not share personal information.

To receive our email newsletters and special e-mail offers, you must voluntarily opt in to our mailing lists. **We do not buy or sell lists.** Any emails, articles, or other information you forward to friends from our sites is confidential, and we will not add your friends to our lists unless they choose to opt in. We may occasionally send you special third-party offers via e-mail. We maintain all personal information and do not give that information out to those third parties. You may opt out of these lists at any time by [clicking here](https://web.archive.org/newsletters/unsubscribe.html).

When you order products online, subscribe or enter an online contest, we will request more personal information such as your mailing address, phone number and credit card information to enable us to properly handle your requests. This information will not be shared.

Our sites may provide links or ads to other web sites. We do not endorse or accept responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those sites. DoubleClick is our third-party ad server.
