**IP Address, Diagnostics and Cookies**

We use your internet protocol address and diagnostic information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. We also use your internet protocol address to help identify you and your shopping cart. 

Our website places “cookies” on your computer’s hard drive through your web browsers to keep track of your identity for the purposes of saving your shopping cart and saving your logged-in state so that you do not have to log in each time you visit our website. “Cookies” allow our website to recognize your computer when you access the website.

**Contact Information/Financial Information**

Our website’s registration and order forms require users to provide us with contact information to establish membership accounts and purchase services and products. CL collects each user’s name, user ID, address, city, state, postal code, telephone number, IP address and e-mail address. CL uses this information to contact the user regarding purchases, orders and administrative matters (such as reminders regarding the start time/date for an instructional program you chose to attend). New users must opt in to receive commercial communications and may opt out of receiving future commercial communications at any time (see “Anti-Spam Policy/Opt-out Choice” below). CL gathers only user information that is needed to administer its business and enhance and improve its services and products. 

CL also collects and stores information and content you provide to us for your user profile, which is publicly visible to other users of the website. Your username and profile image will be displayed next to your discussion forum posts, comments to our blog, course reviews, and other content that you post or upload to public areas of our website. Examples of information you can provide for your profile are name, brief biography, hobbies and interests, and one or more links to your personal website(s). You can also upload a photo or elect to use your Facebook profile picture, Twitter avatar image, or Gravatar image as your profile picture on our website. If you elect one of these options, you give us permission to access your Facebook, Twitter, or Gravatar account, as the case may be, solely for purposes of displaying your Facebook profile picture, your Twitter avatar image, or your Gravatar profile image as part of your profile on the website.
