                   <p>The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) is a national

                    10 Provincial Real Estate Associations, one Territorial Association
                    and all licensed brokers and salespersons (REALTORS) who
                    are Members of those organizations. CREA's mission is to
                     represent and promote the interests of its Members, enhance
                     Member professionalism and ability to succeed, and advocates
                    policies that ensure real estate property rights and ownership. </p>
                   <span class="bprivacy">THE PRIVACY CODE OF THE CANADIAN REAL
                   ESTATE ASSOCIATION</span>                   <p>In 2001, the members of The Canadian Real Estate Association
                    approved the adoption of a national Privacy Code. This Code,
                    which applies to all member Boards, Associations, brokerage
                    firms, brokers and salespersons, is comprised of the 10 Principles
                    of privacy, which set in place a solid foundation within
                    which the REALTOR community can protect the confidentiality
                    of the Personal Information of its customers, clients and
                    the general public. </p>
                  <p>CREA adheres to and abides by the Principles set out in
                    the Privacy Code. </p>
                  <p>Those Principles have been incorporated into this Policy,
                    which is intended to outline CREA's practices with regard
                    to the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information. </p>
