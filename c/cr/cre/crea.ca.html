	Background</h2>
<p>The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) is a national trade association representing some 100 Real Estate Boards, 10 Provincial Real Estate Associations, one Territorial Association and all licensed brokers and salespersons (REALTORS<sup>®</sup>) who are Members of those organizations. CREA's mission is to represent and promote the interests of its Members, enhance Member professionalism and ability to succeed, and advocates policies that ensure real estate property rights and ownership.</p>
<h2>
	The Privacy Code of The Canadian Real Estate Association</h2>
<p>In 2001, the members of The Canadian Real Estate Association approved the adoption of a national Privacy Code. This Code, which applies to all member Boards, Associations, brokerage firms, brokers and salespersons, is comprised of the 10 Principles of privacy, which set in place a solid foundation within which the REALTOR<sup>®</sup> community can protect the confidentiality of the Personal Information of its customers, clients and the general public. CREA adheres to and abides by the Principles set out in the Privacy Code. Those Principles have been incorporated into this Policy, which is intended to outline CREA's practices with regard to the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information.</p>

<h2>

<p>Unless permitted by law, or within the terms of this Privacy Policy or CREA's By-laws, Rules, and Regulations no Personal Information is collected from an individual without first obtaining the consent of the individual to the collection, use and dissemination of that information.</p>
<p>CREA may collect Personal Information of Members directly from the Member. Personal Information may also be provided to CREA by the Board/Association, which is collected at the time of the individual's application for membership.

CREA may also disclose Personal Information of Members to Boards/Associations or real estate regulators for membership or related purposes.</p>
<p>CREA may also disclose personal information of Members to third parties, such as lawyers, consultants, affinity partners or others who work with CREA to collect and analyze information from Members, to improve the products and services offered by CREA or to provide products and services to Members. Some of these third parties may send information to or contact the individual as part of membership surveys.</p>
<p>Personal information may only be provided to organizations providing services to CREA if they agree to use such information solely for the purposes of providing services to CREA and under the instruction of CREA and, with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with this Policy.</p>
<h4>

<p>In certain circumstances, CREA may be permitted or required by law to disclose Personal Information without consent.&nbsp;Those circumstances may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		Where the information was public;</li>
<li>
		Where required by law;</li>
<li>
		Where it is necessary to collect dues;</li>
<li>
		Where it is necessary to protect the rights of an identifiable person or group;</li>
<li>
		Other circumstances recognized by the privacy legislation as permitting disclosure without consent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
	Protecting Personal Information</h2>
<p>CREA takes reasonable steps to protect information from unauthorized access or disclosure in a manner commensurate with its sensitivity, value and criticality. This Policy applies regardless of the media on which the information is stored, the location where the information is stored, the systems used to process the information or the processes by which information is handled.</p>
<p>The measures used to protect Personal Information include physical measures (e.g. locked filing cabinets), organizational measures (e.g. information is available to other persons only on a need-to-know-basis) and technological measures (e.g. computer passwords).</p>
<p>While CREA puts in place reasonable precautions, we cannot guarantee at all times the security of the information. No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure, particularly with regard to Internet applications.</p>
<h2>
	Accuracy</h2>
<p>CREA attempts to insure the personal information under its control is as accurate, complete, current and relevant as is necessary for its identified purpose. Personal information of Members which is uploaded directly to CREA's database by Member Boards/Associations is the responsibility of the Member and or the Boards/Associations. Listing information uploaded by the Boards/Associations to CREA's property database websites is the responsibility of the listing REALTOR<sup>®</sup> and/or the Board/Association. Information in closed files is not updated or maintained.</p>

CREA will endeavour to provide any applicable information within 30 days of the date of the request. CREA may charge a nominal amount for costs incurred in providing the information. Where an individual believes that the personal information in the CREA file is inaccurate, he or she may have appended to the record any alternative information, where CREA is of the view that the appended information is, in fact, correct.</p>
<p>CREA has the right to decline to provide access to personal information in a number of circumstances, including where the information:</p>

<li>
		Any other circumstances recognized by the privacy legislation. Where the information cannot be disclosed, the individual making the request will be provided with the reasons for non-disclosure.</li>
</ul>
