<p><strong>Privacy  Policy</strong></p>
<p>Hive Empire Pty Ltd ACN 118 785 121(“Hive  Empire” or “we”) takes your privacy seriously. We have adopted the following  principles in relation to how we manage personal information.</p>
<p><a id="12b0a5bdcd8c0865_12a20fbb4456b81a_a" name="12b0a5bdcd8c0865_12a20fbb4456b81a_a"></a><strong>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collection</strong></p>
<p>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hive Empire will not collect personal  information unless the information is necessary for one or more of its  functions or activities.</p>
<p>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hive Empire will collect personal  information only by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably intrusive  way.</p>
<p>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At or before the time (or, if that is not  practicable, as soon as practicable after) Hive Empire collects personal  information about an individual from the individual, Hive Empire takes  reasonable steps to ensure that the individual is aware of:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the identity of the organisation and how  to contact it; and</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the fact that he or she is able to gain  access to the information; and</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the purposes for which the information is  collected; and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the organisations (or the types of  organisations) to which the organisation usually discloses information of that  kind; and</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any law that requires the particular  information to be collected; and</p>
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the main consequences (if any) for the  individual if all or part of the information is not provided.</p>
<p>1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is reasonable and practicable to do  so, Hive Empire will collect personal information about an individual only from  that individual.</p>
<p>1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Hive Empire collects personal  information about an individual from someone else, it takes reasonable steps to  ensure that the individual is or has been made aware of the matters listed in  subclause 1.3 except to the extent that making the individual aware of the  matters would pose a serious threat to the life or health of any individual.</p>
<p><a id="12b0a5bdcd8c0865_12a20fbb4456b81a_b" name="12b0a5bdcd8c0865_12a20fbb4456b81a_b"></a><strong>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use and disclosure</strong></p>
<p>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hive Empire will not use or disclose  personal information about an individual for a purpose (the secondary purpose)  other than the primary purpose of collection unless:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; both of the following apply:</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the secondary purpose is related to the  primary purpose of collection and, if the personal information is sensitive  information, directly related to the primary purpose of collection;</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the individual would reasonably expect  the organisation to use or disclose the information for the secondary purpose;  or</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the individual has consented to the  use or disclosure; or</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the information is not sensitive  information and the use of the information is for the secondary purpose of  direct marketing:</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is impracticable for Hive Empire to  seek the individual’s consent before that particular use; and</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hive Empire will not charge the  individual for giving effect to a request by the individual to the organisation  not to receive direct marketing communications; and</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the individual has not made a request to Hive  Empire not to receive direct marketing communications; and</p>
<p>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in each direct marketing communication  with the individual, the organisation draws to the individual’s attention, that  he or she may express a wish not to receive any further direct marketing  communications; and</p>
<p>(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each written direct marketing  communication by Hive Empire with the individual (up to and including the  communication that involves the use) sets out Hive Empire contact details; or</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hive Empire reasonably believes that the  use or disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent:</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a serious and imminent threat to an  individual’s life, health or safety; or</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a serious threat to public health or  public safety; or</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hive Empire has reason to suspect that  unlawful activity has been, is being or may be engaged in, and uses or  discloses the personal information as a necessary part of its investigation of  the matter or in reporting its concerns to relevant persons or authorities; or</p>
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the use or disclosure is required or  authorised by or under law; or</p>
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hive Empire reasonably believes that the  use or disclosure is reasonably necessary for one or more of the following by  or on behalf of an enforcement body:</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the prevention, detection,  investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences, breaches of a  law imposing a penalty or sanction or breaches of a prescribed law;</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the enforcement of laws relating to the  confiscation of the proceeds of crime;</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the protection of the public revenue;</p>
<p>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the prevention, detection, investigation  or remedying of seriously improper conduct or prescribed conduct;</p>
<p>(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the preparation for, or conduct of,  proceedings before any court or tribunal, or implementation of the orders of a  court or tribunal.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data  quality</strong></p>
<p>Hive Empire will take reasonable steps to  make sure that the personal information it collects, uses or discloses is  accurate, complete and up-to-date.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data  security</strong></p>
<p>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hive Empire will take reasonable steps to  protect the personal information it holds from misuse and loss and from  unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.</p>
<p>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hive Empire will take reasonable steps to  destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if it is no longer  needed for any purpose for which the information may be used or disclosed under  National Privacy Principle 2.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Openness</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hive Empire will set out in a document  clearly expressed policies on its management of personal information. The  organisation must make the document available to anyone who asks for it.</p>
<p>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On request by a person, Hive Empire will  take reasonable steps to let the person know, generally, what sort of personal  information it holds, for what purposes, and how it collects, holds, uses and  discloses that information.</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access  and correction</strong></p>
<p>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Hive Empire holds personal information  about an individual, it will provide the individual with access to the  information on request by the individual, except to the extent that:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the case of personal information other  than health information, providing access would pose a serious and imminent  threat to the life or health of any individual; or</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the case of health information, providing  access would pose a serious threat to the life or health of any individual; or</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; providing access would have an  unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals; or</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the request for access is frivolous or  vexatious; or</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the information relates to existing or  anticipated legal proceedings between the organisation and the individual, and  the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those  proceedings; or</p>
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; providing access would reveal the  intentions of the organisation in relation to negotiations with the individual  in such a way as to prejudice those negotiations; or</p>
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; providing access would be unlawful; or</p>
<p>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; denying access is required or authorised  by or under law; or</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; providing access would be likely to  prejudice an investigation of possible unlawful activity; or</p>
<p>(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; providing access would be likely to  prejudice:</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the prevention, detection,  investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences, breaches of a  law imposing a penalty or sanction or breaches of a prescribed law; or</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the enforcement of laws relating to the  confiscation of the proceeds of crime; or</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the protection of the public revenue; or</p>
<p>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the prevention, detection, investigation  or remedying of seriously improper conduct or prescribed conduct; or</p>
<p>(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the preparation for, or conduct of,  proceedings before any court or tribunal, or implementation of its orders,</p>
<p>by or on  behalf of an enforcement body; or</p>
<p>(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an enforcement body performing a lawful  security function asks the organisation not to provide access to the  information on the basis that providing access would be likely to cause damage  to the security of Australia.</p>
<p>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, where providing access would  reveal evaluative information generated within the organisation in connection  with a commercially sensitive decision-making process, Hive Empire will give  the individual an explanation for the commercially sensitive decision rather  than direct access to the information.</p>
<p>6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Hive Empire is not required to provide  the individual with access to the information because of one or more of paragraphs  6.1(a) to (k) (inclusive), it will, if reasonable, consider whether the use of  mutually agreed intermediaries would allow sufficient access to meet the needs  of both parties.</p>
<p>6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Hive Empire charges for providing  access to personal information, those charges:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will not be excessive; and</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will not apply to lodging a request for  access.</p>
<p>6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Hive Empire holds personal information  about an individual and the individual is able to establish that the  information is not accurate, complete and up-to-date, the organisation must  take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate,  complete and up-to-date.</p>
<p>6.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the individual and Hive Empire disagree  about whether the information is accurate, complete and up-to-date, and the  individual asks the organisation to associate with the information a statement  claiming that the information is not accurate, complete or up-to-date, the  organisation must take reasonable steps to do so.</p>
<p>6.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hive Empire will provide reasons for denial  of access or a refusal to correct personal information.</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identifiers</strong></p>
<p>7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hive Empire will not adopt as its own  identifier of an individual an identifier of the individual that has been  assigned by:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a government agency; or</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an agent of a government agency acting in  its capacity as agent; or</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a contracted service provider for a  Commonwealth contract acting in its capacity as contracted service provider for  that contract.</p>
<p>7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hive Empire will not use or disclose an  identifier assigned to an individual by an agency, or by an agent or contracted  service provider mentioned in subclause 7.1, unless:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the use or disclosure is necessary for  the organisation to fulfil its obligations to the agency; or</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one or more of paragraphs 2.1(e) to  2.1(h) (inclusive) apply to the use or disclosure; or</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the use or disclosure is by a prescribed  organisation of a prescribed identifier in prescribed circumstances.</p>
<p>7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this clause, identifier includes a  number assigned by an organisation to an individual to identify uniquely the  individual for the purposes of the organisation’s operations. However, an  individual’s name or ABN (as defined in the A New Tax System (Australian  Business Number) Act 1999) is not an identifier.</p>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anonymity</strong></p>
<p>Wherever it is lawful and practicable,  individuals must have the option of not identifying themselves when entering  transactions with Hive Empire.</p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transborder  data flows</strong></p>
<p>Hive Empire may transfer personal information  about an individual to someone (other than the organisation or the individual)  who is in a foreign country only if:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hive Empire reasonably believes that the  recipient of the information is subject to a law, binding scheme or contract  which effectively upholds principles for fair handling of the information that  are substantially similar to the National Privacy Principles; or</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the individual consents to the transfer;  or</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the transfer is necessary for the  performance of a contract between the individual and Hive Empire, or for the  implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in response to the  individual’s request; or</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the transfer is necessary for the  conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the  individual between the organisation and a third party; or</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all of the following apply:</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the transfer is for the benefit of the  individual;</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is impracticable to obtain the consent  of the individual to that transfer;</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if it were practicable to obtain such  consent, the individual would be likely to give it; or</p>
<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hive Empire has taken reasonable steps to  ensure that the information which it has transferred will not be held, used or  disclosed by the recipient of the information inconsistently with the National  Privacy Principles.</p>
<p><strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sensitive  information</strong></p>
<p>10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hive  Empire will not collect sensitive information about an individual unless:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the individual has consented; or</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the collection is required by law; or</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the collection is necessary to prevent or  lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of any individual,  where the individual whom the information concerns:</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is physically or legally incapable of  giving consent to the collection; or</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; physically cannot communicate consent to  the collection; or</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the collection is necessary for the  establishment, exercise or defence of a legal or equitable claim.</p>
