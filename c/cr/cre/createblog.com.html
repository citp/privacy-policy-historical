</ul>
<br><br>



<div class="cell_title">Information Collection and How it is used</div>
<br>

<b>General Information</b>

<ul>
<li>CreateBlog collects personal information when you register with CreateBlog to use CreateBlog services or to post content on CreateBlog.</li>
<li>When you register we ask for your email address and certain optional information such as your name, birth date, birth place, gender, biographical information, ICQ/AIM/Yahoo/MSN user name, and personal interests.</li>
<li>CreateBlog automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie, and the page you request.</li>
<li>CreateBlog uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, research, and anonymous reporting.</li>
</ul>

<b>IP Addresses</b><br><br>

IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. Your IP address is stored in our user registration databases when you register with CreateBlog.
<br><br>

IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including: 

<ul>
<li>To diagnose or service technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.</li>

</ul>

<b>Cookies</b><br><br>

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.

<ul>
<li>You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.</li>
<li>If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use CreateBlog products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of the CreateBlog service.</li>
<li>CreateBlog uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to:<br>
o Access your information when you "sign in".<br>
o Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using CreateBlog's services.<br>
o Display the most appropriate advertising banners, based on your interests and activity on CreateBlog.<br>
o Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.<br>
o Conduct research to improve CreateBlog's content and services.</li>
<li>CreateBlog lets other companies (such as Google) that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other entities' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other entities do not have access to CreateBlog's cookies.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>



<div class="cell_title">Information Sharing and Disclosure</div>

<ul>
<li>When you post a message, your CreateBlog ID or alias that you are posting under is visible to other users.</li>
<li>If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. CreateBlog does not rent or sell your personal information.</li>
<li>Generally, CreateBlog does not share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies without your consent except to provide products or services you've requested and in the following circumstances: 
<ul><li>CreateBlog may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas, warrants, court orders or legal process or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;</li></ul></li>
<li>It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including without limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of CreateBlog's terms of use, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. We will transfer information about you if CreateBlog is acquired by or merged with another company. CreateBlog may share demographic information with business partners, such as "53% of users who regularly user CreateBlog chat are between 18 and 24" or the like. No personally identifiable information will ever be used without your permission (i.e. we will ask you for a quote or testimonial)</li>
<li>CreateBlog displays targeted advertisements based on personal information that is exhibited in people's profiles. This may sometimes make you laugh, as when it shows advertisements for rabbit feed on the profile page of a person whose handle is "BunnyLove." When you register with us, your personal information and other data will be stored and processed in Canada and the United States and this information may be subject to the laws of these jurisidictions.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<br><br>


<div class="cell_title">Changes to this Privacy Policy</div>
