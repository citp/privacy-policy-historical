### Privacy commitment

**1.1** The creativetimes.co.uk website is owned and operated by the Creative Industries Development Service (CIDS). We are committed to safeguarding your privacy online and to this end have developed the following Privacy Policy. This policy may change from time to time so please check it periodically.

### Information we collect and why

**2.1** When you register with CREATIVE Times, we ask for information such as your name, e-mail address, contact details, local authority area and information about your business, so that we can best identify what services and/or information is appropriate for you and your business.

**2.2** We keep a record of your details in order to fulfil our role as a provider of information, support and guidance for creative sector businesses in Greater Manchester. This is necessary in order for us to be able to contact you with current and future information about opportunities that may be of interest to you. This information is recorded whether you register with us in person, by phone or online.

### How we use your personal data

**3.1** All the information we hold about you is used for four main reasons:

  * Firstly, we use it to contact you with information from ourselves and our partners that we think may be of relevance and/or interest to you. 
  * Secondly we use it to analyse, identify and report on the size and nature of the creative industry sector in Greater Manchester, data that helps us make the case for greater industry support from government bodies like the DTI.
  * Thirdly, where the support or advice provided to you has been as a direct result of a European, national, regional or local government funding scheme which requires us to keep records on businesses and individuals that have received this support.
  * Lastly, we may use technology to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to our sites. This can include using a "cookie" which would be stored on your browser. You can usually modify your browser to prevent this happening. The information collected in this way can be used to identify you unless you modify your browser settings. We also track click-through links in emails sent as part of our e-newsletter subscription service.



We are committed to using your personal information for these reasons only.

**3.2** The only circumstances where we may share some of your data with third parties is where, in our judgement, these third parties have a product, service, event or scheme that will be advantageous to you as an individual or business within the Greater Manchester creative sector. When joining one of our mailing lists you are given the opportunity to opt in to receiving information from third parties. CIDS will only pass on your Personal Information if the relevant box has been ticked. In these instances, we supply your Personal Information for one-off use by the third party. 

### Correcting and updating information

**4.1** If you do not wish to receive information of this nature, please either advise us when registering, email [info@cids.co.uk](mailto:info@cids.co.uk) or call 0800 169 1143.
