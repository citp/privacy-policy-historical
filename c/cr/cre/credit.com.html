</p><p>This privacy policy applies to the website located at www.credit.com, which is owned and operated
by Credit.com Inc. ("Credit.com"). It governs Credit.com's collection, use and disclosure of 
non-public personal information ("NPPI"), defined below, received from our current and former customers
or collected by us concerning our current and former customers. We reserve the right to modify this
privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make changes to this policy, we will
change the date above. If we change this policy in a way that allows us to use your NPPI in a
materially different manner, we will notify you here, by e-mail, or by means of a notice on our
homepage prior to the change becoming effective, and we will obtain your opt-in consent before
using your NPPI in such a materially different manner.</p>

<p>We take the privacy and security of your NPPI seriously and believe it is important that you

<p>Credit.com is dedicated to protecting the privacy of our customers.</p>

<p>Credit.com Inc. has received TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and our
practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation
page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal. The TRUSTe program does not cover information that
may be collected through downloadable software. The TRUSTe program covers only information
that is collected through this website, www.credit.com.</p>


<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily,
please contact TRUSTe&nbsp;<a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>What information we collect and how we collect it.</h3>

      <p>We collect the following categories of NPPI: (i) information you provide, such as your contact
information; (ii) information about your transactions with us or our affiliates; (iii) information about
your transactions with unaffiliated third-parties to whom your information is disclosed by us to fulfill a
transaction you request, such as obtaining a personal loan or credit card; and (iv) information
obtained from any consumer reporting agency, such as your credit history.</p>





      <h3>Non-public personal information</h3>
      <p>NPPI includes any information: (i) you provide to obtain a financial product or service; (ii) about you
resulting from any transaction involving a financial product or service; or (iii) that we otherwise obtain
about you in connection with providing a financial product or service that you request. This type of
information does not include information that is collected anonymously or for the purpose of tracking
movement on our website. In order for you to access many of the products and services offered
through this site, you may be required to provide us with NPPI, such as:</p>

<ul>
        <li>Name;</li>
        <li>Street or postal address;</li>
        <li>E-mail address;</li>
        <li>Phone number;</li>
        <li>Your place of employment, employer, length of time you worked there;</li>
        <li>Number of years you lived in your home or other information about your home;</li>
        <li>Loan purpose and loan amount;</li>
        <li>Social Security number;</li>
        <li>Date of birth;</li>
        <li>Debit or credit card number, expiration date and security code.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This information is used to identify you, complete your requests for financial products or services,
		facilitate requests for other products or services, and for customer service fulfillment.</p>

		<h3>Traffic data</h3>
		<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This
information may include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider
(ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. Though we
may link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you, we will not share
any of this automatically collected data.</p>

<p>No NPPI that identifies a customer or former customer is revealed in the collection and use of traffic
data. Consequently, we do not adjust or alter our website's automatic tracking and data collection in
response to a Do Not Track signal or request. We believe we can offer customers a more
personalized experience when visiting our website when we are able to retrieve data from a
customer's previous activity on our website. We do share anonymous traffic and transactional
information with our affiliates and service providers on an aggregate basis for marketing, accounting
and site-optimization purposes.</p>

      <h3>Categories of information we disclose</h3>
      <p>Credit.com may disclose the NPPI we collect about you, described above, to our affiliates or
unaffiliated third-parties, as described below, and as otherwise permitted by law.</p>

	  <blockquote>
	    <p>(i) To financial institutions and other lenders or other service providers in order to fulfill or respond to
your request for credit or other services we offer or to otherwise contact you with information about
their products or services. When a financial institution contacts you, its use of your information is
subject to its privacy policy and not ours; and</p>

        <p>(ii) To affiliates and service providers that perform professional services for us, such as demographic
analysis for marketing purposes and accounting or assistance with marketing, advertising,
product/service offerings and customer service fulfillment. These companies are authorized to use
your NPPI only as necessary to provide these services to us. For example, we may provide your
contact information to our service providers for direct emailing of our newsletters or to provide you
with notifications of our product/service offerings via email, phone or text message.</p>
      </blockquote>

	  <p>Selected NPPI, such as your Social Security number and debit or credit card numbers, expiration
dates and security codes are immediately encrypted.</p>

      <p>Credit.com does not sell, rent or otherwise disclose your NPPI to third parties except as explained in
this privacy policy and as permitted by law.</p>

	  <p>We may share aggregated information (i.e., collective information about you and other customers,
but not specifically identifiable to you) and other deidentified or anonymous information we collect
with third parties.</p>


      <h3>Why we need your e-mail address</h3>
      <p>We use your e-mail address to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Confirm your identity;</li>
        <li>Send you information on the status of your transaction;</li>
        <li>Contact you if we need your assistance to complete the transaction;</li>
        <li>Send you newsletters, and other customer related material as permitted by law.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Credit.com has a zero tolerance policy for e-mail abuse. If you receive unsolicited e-mails from
Credit.com, please report it to us at&nbsp;<a href="http://support.credit.com">http://support.credit.com</a>. We are not responsible for
communications you may receive from unaffiliated third-parties.</p>

	  <p>We will never ask you to provide NPPI in an e-mail. DO NOT RESPOND to an e-mail that appears to
be from us requesting NPPI. Contact us immediately at&nbsp;<a href="http://support.credit.com">http://support.credit.com</a>.</p>

	  <p>If you contact us by e-mail, we will respond by e-mail.</p>


      <h3>What choices you have regarding the use of your information</h3>
      <p>
	  <strong>E-mail correspondence.</strong> You may opt out of receiving e-mails from us in one of two ways:</p>

      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>If you subscribe to the service online, you may "uncheck" the box next to the offer on the online
form you complete; or</li>
        <li>Click on the 'unsubscribe' link in the e-mail you receive.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>When you unsubscribe, you will receive an e-mail confirming your decision to opt out.</p>

	  <p><strong>Confirmations.</strong> You may not opt out of confirmation e-mail messages and messages that are part
of the service to which you are subscribed. They are designed to confirm your identity and your
decision to enter into a transaction. Confirmation e-mails often contain important instructions about
your transaction. If you do not wish to receive confirmation e-mails, do not sign up for services or
products on this website.</p>

      <h3>Your access to identifying NPPI</h3>
      <p>If you want to delete your identifying NPPI, including your e-mail address, or if you no longer 
      are interested in a service found on this website, you may request deletion of your identifying NPPI 
      or deactivation by contacting customer service at&nbsp;<a href="http://support.credit.com">http://support.credit.com</a>.
      We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.   
      In the event that 
      certain information cannot be deleted (because, for example, the information is being retained to 
      document compliance or to ensure that Credit.com can enforce its legal rights), we may not delete 
      such information. Information entered on the Credit.com website will be automatically updated each 
      time you apply for a new or different service. In addition, we will deactivate your account when 
      you send such a request to&nbsp;<a href="http://support.credit.com">http://support.credit.com</a>. Please note 
      that deactivation of your account 
      will not necessarily result in the deletion of your NPPI.</p>

      <h3>Credit.com reserves the right to disclose your NPPI, including your e-mail address, without notice or your
consent:</h3>

      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>To comply with federal, state or local laws, rules and other applicable legal requirements; or</li>
        <li>To comply with a properly authorized civil, criminal, or regulatory investigation, or subpoena or
			summons by federal, state or local authorities; or</li>
        <li>To respond to judicial process or government regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over
			Credit.com for examination, compliance, other purposes as authorized by law; or</li>
        <li>To enforce our Terms of Service; or</li>
        <li>To permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; or</li>
        <li>To our service providers to verify the integrity of the information collected; or</li>
        <li>To our affiliated business partners for accounting purposes; or</li>
        <li>For any other purpose permitted by applicable law.</li>
      </ol>

      	<h3>Business Transitions</h3>

		<p>If Credit.com is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your NPPI or
other information may be disclosed to third parties concerned or their professional advisors. In the
event of such a transaction, the NPPI held by Credit.com will be among the assets transferred to the
buyer.</p>

      <h3>Important note regarding non-U.S. users and U.S. law</h3>

      <p>The laws and regulations of different countries and states impose different requirements on data
protections and the use of the Internet. Credit.com is located in California, in the United States of
America, as are the servers that make this website available worldwide. The laws of the State of
California and the United States of America govern all matters relating to this website. If you provide

      <p>We do not permit third parties to collect NPPI on our website, but our website does include links to
third-party websites, services and products, and when you link to a third-party website, the third-
party website's privacy policy applies. In addition, you authorize us to provide your NPPI to
unaffiliated third parties (including, without limitation, CSIdentity Corporation) when you request a
financial product or service offered by a third party.</p>

      <p>Because this privacy policy applies only to the Credit.com website, it may be different from the
privacy policies of the unaffiliated third parties to whom your NPPI is disclosed to process the
financial product or service you request or authorize. Credit.com urges you to review the privacy
policies of every website you visit where you are required to disclose your NPPI to obtain a product
or service.</p>

      <h3>Your use of this website</h3>
      <p>By using this website, you represent to us that you are an adult under the laws of the jurisdiction
where you reside and that you have had an opportunity to review the terms of this privacy policy and
the Terms of Use posted on this website. Do not use this website or disclose any NPPI if the terms
of this privacy policy are not acceptable to you or if you do not agree to all provisions of our Terms of
Use.</p>


      <h3>Protect and verify your identifying NPPI</h3>
      <p>We urge you to take adequate precautions to protect your identifying NPPI, both on and off the
Internet. (To learn more go to:&nbsp;<a href="http://onguardonline.gov/index.html">http://onguardonline.gov/index.html</a>)</p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>Credit.com is a VeriSign® secured website and uses a VeriSign® SSL Certificate for encryption.
Customer data is securely transmitted by Credit.com to unaffiliated third parties as permitted by this
privacy policy or by law and to service providers through a combination of encryption techniques and
other privacy protection measures. Selected NPPI submitted through the Credit.com website, such
as your Social Security number or payment card data, are encrypted.</p>

	  <p>Credit.com also maintains and enforces strict internal policies to protect NPPI from unauthorized
access by employees or third parties. When you submit information to Credit.com through our
website, you should be aware that your information is transmitted across the Internet and that no
method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Although we take reasonable security
measures to protect your information when we receive it, you also need to ensure you take
appropriate steps to protect your information. If you have any questions about security on our
website, you can contact us at&nbsp;<a href="http://support.credit.com">http://support.credit.com</a>.
If you have reason to believe that your
interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you
might have with us has been compromised), please notify us of the problem as soon as possible by
contacting us in accordance with the "Contact us" section above (note that if you choose to notify us
via physical mail, this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem).</p>

	<h3>Tracking Technologies</h3>

	<p>Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Credit.com and our partners
(e.g., email service providers), affiliates, or analytics or service providers (e.g., online customer
support providers). These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the website,
tracking users' movements around the website and to gather demographic information about our
user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these
companies on an individual, as well as aggregate, basis.</p>

	<p>We use cookies to remember users' settings (e.g., language preference), for authentication, and to
track and manage marketing. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If
you reject cookies, you may still use our website, but your ability to use some features or areas of
our website may be limited.</p>

	<h3>Behavioral Targeting</h3>

	<p>We partner with third-party advertising networks to either display advertising on our website or to
manage our advertising on other websites. Our network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to
collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to
provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information
used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt out by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com" target="_blank">here</a>. Please note this
does not opt you out of being sent advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

      <h3>Terms Used in This Statement</h3>
	  <br>

      <h4>Encryption</h4>
      <p>Credit.com uses encryption to secure selected NPPI such as Social Security number and payment
card data. Encryption is a way to scramble data to make it unreadable to anyone other than the
intended recipient. If it is intercepted by a third party while traveling over a network, it cannot be
read. Only the persons sending and receiving the encrypted data have a key to unscramble the data
and make it readable. Credit.com uses industry standard SSL, AES and RSA encryption.</p>

      <h4>Secure Sockets Layer</h4>
      <p>Secure Sockets Layer is the industry standard method for protecting website communications by
encrypting information, thus making it unreadable to anyone except the holders of the keys used to
read the information. Credit.com uses the SSL protocol to capture selected NPPI, such as your
credit card numbers, via the Internet.</p>

      <h4>SSL Certificate</h4>
      <p>A SSL Certificate binds an entity to a pair of electronic keys that can be used to encrypt and sign
digital information. A SSL Certificate makes it possible for you to verify that we have the right to use
a given key, helping to prevent others from using phony keys to impersonate us. For more
information about our certificate, click on the VeriSign® logo.</p>


      <h4>Third-Party Data Sources</h4>
      <p>We use third parties to verify the integrity of selected NPPI you provide so we can confirm your
identity.</p>
