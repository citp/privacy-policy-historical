      <h4>Encryption</h4>
      <p>
	  Credit.com uses encryption to secure selected NPPI such as Social Security numbers, drivers license numbers, and credit card data. Encryption is a way to scramble data to make it unreadable to anyone other than the intended recipient. If it is intercepted by a third-party while traveling over a network it cannot be read. Only the persons sending and receiving the encrypted data have a key to unscramble the data and make it readable. Encryption provides privacy for email, discussion group postings, and other communications as they move over networks. Credit.com uses industry standard SSL, AES and RSA encryption.

      <h4>Secure Sockets Layer</h4>
      <p>
	  Secure Sockets Layer is the industry standard method for protecting web site communications by encrypting information thus making it unreadable to anyone except the holders of the keys used to read the information. Credit.com uses the SSL protocol to capture selected NPPI, such as your credit card numbers via the Internet.

      <h4>SSL Certificate</h4>
      <p>
	  A SSL Certificate binds an entity to a pair of electronic keys that can be used to encrypt and sign digital information. A SSL Certificate makes it possible for you to verify that we have the right to use a given key, helping to prevent others from using phony keys to impersonate us. For more information about our certificate, click on the VeriSign® logo.

      <h4>Third Data Sources</h4>
      <p>
	  We use third-parties to verify the integrity of selected NPPI you provide so we can confirm your identity.

      <h4>Web-beacons</h4>
      <p>
	  A web beacons is a tracking marker that is placed within a web page or in an e-mail message. Web beacons are invisible to your eye, and are used to monitor a computer which is accessing a particular web page or e-mail message and transfer the data to a server. Credit.com uses web beacons to:
	  </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Count website visits to  specific areas at the Credit.com website;</li>
        <li>Track and account for transactional information on the websites of non-affiliated third-parties or service providers;</li>
        <li>Collect aggregate transactional data for accounting purposes;</li>
        <li>Track statistics about:
	        <ul type="circle">
	          <li>The IP address of the computer that fetched the web beacon</li>
	          <li>The URL of the page that the web Beacon is located on</li>
	          <li>The URL of the web beacon</li>
	          <li>The time the web beacon was viewed</li>
	          <li>The type of browser that fetched the web beacon image</li>
	          <li>A previously set cookie value</li>
	        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
