Through this Internet Privacy Statement, we want to reassure users of the Site that we will not sell, share, or rent user information to others in a manner different than as set forth in this Internet Privacy Statement. 

**Security Information and Secure Ordering**  
Strong precautions are taken to protect the information of the users of our Site. When users submit sensitive information via the Site, that Information is protected both online and off-line.

Furthermore, your information and is protected utilizing the industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption software. The information you send us is encrypted on your computer, sent through the Internet as jumbled code, and decoded at CreateForLess' secure site. While on a secure page, such as our Order Detail page, the lock icon appears on the bottom of your Web browser, such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. The lock appears closed, as opposed to un-locked, or open, as it is shown when you are just 'surfing'.

All of the information of our Site's users, including the sensitive information for ordering, is maintained in a restricted area.

You may have heard of the term "cookies". Cookies are routinely used by most, if not all, E- commerce merchants, including CreateForLess.

However, if a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our Site although we will be unable to provide our users with the personalized shopping experience we can offer using the cookie data. CreateForLess does not use cookies, or other nonconsensual methods, to take personally identifiable or online contact information about specific users. If you have any questions about our use of cookies, please contact us at [info@CreateForLess.com](mailto:info@CreateForLess.com). 

**Special Offers, Account Updates and Opting Out**  
CreateForLess occasionally sends our customers and the users of the Site announcements and updates, which contain important information about the Site and service offerings which we believe to be of value to our customers and users. In order to do this, we may enhance or merge the information we collect on the Site with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to our customers and users. 

We may communicate with the users of the Site via e-mail, telephone, mail, or fax in order to provide requested services, content, product information, notification of special offers, or in regard to customer service issues relating to an account. The users of the Site are always given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their online information used for purposes not directly related to the Site. This option is available when we ask for the information or when the user receives an online requested promotional communication. 

For example, our e-mail messages have an "unsubscribe" feature for users of the Site who buy from us, but don't want to be notified about special offers in the future. Users can simply "Reply" back to the e-mail message and type "unsubscribe" in the subject field. Upon receipt of the reply, CreateForLess will remove that e-mail address from our e-mail list. If a user has more than one e- mail address, he or she should include the other addresses as well to ensure proper updating of their account information. 

Users of the Site can always update the personally identifying information that they have provided to CreateForLess simply by accessing and updating their account information on the Site or by e-mailing us at [info@createforless.com](mailto:info@createforless.com). 

At CreateForLess, your privacy and security are very important to us. If you have any questions about our policies, the practices of our site, or your dealings with CreateForLess, please e-mail us at [info@createforless.com](mailto:info@createforless.com).
