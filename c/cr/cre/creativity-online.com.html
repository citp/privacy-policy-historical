					<h1>Creativity Privacy Policy</h1>
					<div class="body article">
						<p style="clear:left">
							Creativity-online.com is a Web site of Crain Communications Inc. Our postal address is 711 Third Avenue,
							New York, NY 10017-4036. We can be reached by e-mail at AdAgeFeedback@adage.com or by telephone at 
							212-210-0100. Your use of our Web site indicates to us that you have read and accepted our Privacy Policy 
							and our Terms &amp; Conditions of Use.
						</p>
						<p>
							We have developed this Privacy Policy to advise subscribers and users of our products about our possible
							uses of information collected by us and to inform you on how to modify your marketing preferences. This 
							Privacy Policy is subject to change. When we make any material change to this Privacy Policy, we will 
							inform you by posting a notice on the home page of this site and by changing the date on this page noting 
							when the Privacy Policy was last updated. 
						</p>
						<p>
							When you subscribe, register, make purchases or at other times, we collect and store personally identifiable 
							information from you that may include your name, postal and e-mail addresses, credit card information, facts 
							about your profession, company and responsibilities and information regarding your computer system. We may from 
							time to time obtain data from third-parties such as business partners or other companies and append it to existing 
							user data to add more detail to the information we have about you. 
						</p>
						<p>
							For each visitor to this Web site, our web server may automatically attempt to identify the user through a cookie 
							set within your browser. This is done to provide access to the site. From time to time we may also track information, 
							in aggregate, on pages and features that users access or view. The activity is collected and stored in our server's 
							log files. We may log Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems 
							administration and troubleshooting purposes. We use this information in an aggregate fashion to track access to the 
							Web site. Our email alerts utilize tracking technology that allows us to see how many newsletter e-mails are opened 
							and the e-mail address of users who have clicked on a given story, feature or advertisement. We use this information 
							for internal purposes to measure the aggregate number of people who view a given newsletter item.  
						</p>
						<p>
							We may also set cookies to your computer to allow subscribers and users to store login information, set personalization
							and navigate easily through the site. Additionally, through the use of an additional cookies or technology, we will have 
							the ability to track users by their behavior profile and geographic location for the purpose of pushing advertising that 
							matches their interests and/or specific location. We may conduct online surveys and contests or generate content that is 
							presented by aggregating activity of users on the site. These surveys and contests are entirely voluntary and you may 
							decline to participate.

						<p>
							We may use third-party advertising service vendors to serve advertisements on this Web site. These vendors may use cookies,

							other sites you have visited. In doing so, these vendors may collect non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating 
							system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of cookies, web 
							beacons or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and we 
							disclaim all liability in connection therewith. If you do not want the benefits of these advertising cookies, web beacons or 
							similar technologies, you may be able to opt out by visiting www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Information collected about subscribers and users may be used by us and our affiliates and partnering third-party companies to 
							provide subscribers and users with the features of the site, to enable us to provide the products you requested, to personalize 
							content and advertising, to send you e-mail notifications about our services and products, for audits, to perform statistical 
							analysis of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site (such as for product development purposes), 
							to enforce our user agreement and to inform advertisers as to how many users have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. 
							We will disclose site usage information to third-parties only in aggregate.  
						</p>
						<p>
							We may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary 
							to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or 
							unauthorized use of the Web site; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, 
							this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part 
							of any investigation into your actions). In the event that the Advertising Age publication or Web site is acquired by or merged with 
							another company, we may transfer information about you to the successor entity. 
						</p>
						<p>
							From time to time, we may make individual subscriber or user information available to carefully selected third-parties to send you 
							information through e-mail or postal mail about their products or services. If you prefer not to have your personal information 
							disclosed to third-parties for direct marketing purposes, please send an e-mail stating this preference and including your full name 
							and e-mail address to AdAgeFeedback@adage.com or, if you are a print subscriber, please call 1-877-320-1721. A user may change/correct 
							his/her preferences or personal information at any time online or by contacting us at the above e-mail address or phone number. We 
							retain the right to contact a subscriber or registered user regarding account status, orders for products or services, changes to the
							registration agreement or to enforce our subscription agreement.
