### People who complete a contact form

The Creditsafe website uses a number of “Contact us” forms allowing visitors to supply us with their details so we may get in touch with them to discuss our products and services. The details on these forms are collected and passed to our customer service teams to allow them to contact the person completing them.

### People whose information is contained within our products

Creditsafe’s products contain information on the identification, analysis and creditworthiness of businesses. That information is sourced from many original suppliers such as Companies House and the Registry Trust. This data is displayed within Company Credit Reports which can be accessed by our subscription customers when they have logged into our secure services using their user name and password. The information held in our reports may include information that can be used to identify individuals such as company directors. This information will have been sourced by Creditsafe from the original data collector who will have explained what data was being collected and how and why it might be used by third parties such as Creditsafe. Typically this might include directors’ details filed at Companies House as part of a company’s annual return.

### People who email us

Email monitoring or blocking software may also be used to protect personal and other sensitive data within Creditsafe. Please be aware that you have a responsibility to ensure that any email you send to us is within the bounds of the law.

### People who make a complaint to us

When we receive a complaint from a person we make up a file containing the details of the complaint. This normally contains the identity of the complainant, contact details and any other details of the complaint. We will only use the personal information we collect to process the complaint and to check on the level of service we provide.

Personal information about unsuccessful candidates will be held for 12 months after the recruitment exercise has been completed, it will then be destroyed or deleted.

Once a person has taken up employment with Creditsafe, we compile a personnel file relating to their employment. The information contained in this will be kept secure and will only be used for purposes directly relevant to that person’s employment and fulfillment of business requirements. Once their employment has ended we will retain the file in accordance with the requirements of our retention schedule, which is 7 years and then dispose or delete it.
