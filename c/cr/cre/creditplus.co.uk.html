        <h3>What is Social Bookmarking?</h3>
        
        <p>We all have favourite websites that we bookmark so that we can visit them time and time again, but these are stored on a specific PC or laptop meaning that when we use another machine, perhaps at work or at a friend's house, we can't access them.</p>
        <p>Social Networking sites like Facebook and MySpace (sometimes called bookmarking or sharing websites) let you "tag" favourite websites or pages within websites so you can access them from any computer you are using. You can also share them with friends and other people with similar interests, thus spreading the word about a great site or product you have found!</p>
