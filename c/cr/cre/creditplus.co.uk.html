      <p>All vehicle descriptions are supplied by dealers, and therefore Creditplus shall not be held responsible for any related errors or emissions on pricing or vehicle description. Creditplus has the right to refuse a sale or adjust any details up until an order has been received in writing from the customer at an agreed price set by Creditplus.</p>

The car is supplied on the basis that the client understands Creditplus will not rectify or compensate for any car repairs outside of the car warranty.</p>
      <p>If a car is returned the customer bears the cost of return and a cancellation fee of 5% of the car value or a minimum of £500, whichever is the greater.</p>
