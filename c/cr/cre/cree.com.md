Privacy Policy 

As used below, "Company" refers to Cree, Inc. and its subsidiaries. This Privacy Policy covers the Company's treatment of personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information that the Company collects when you visit on this website. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that the Company does not own or control, or to people that the Company does not employ or manage.

**Personal Information**  
The Company may collect personally identifiable information on or from visitors to this website. Personal information may include, among other things, a user's name and address.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**  
In addition to personal information, the Company may also gather non-personally identifiable information, which may be used by the Company. Generally, "non-personally identifiable information" means information that is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of "Cookies", "IP Addresses" or other numeric codes used to identify a computer or monitor how a user accesses a website.

**Information We Request Directly From You**  
The Company may specifically ask for personal information about you when you sign up to use a site feature. You can read company and product information available on the site without revealing any personal information. However, in certain places on this site you may be asked to provide your name and/or e-mail address in order to communicate with us. It is your option to provide the information requested. The information you provide is used by the Company to respond to specific requests that you have made or to improve the services we provide. The Company does not seek information from persons under 13 years of age, and no information should be submitted to this site by guests under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.

**Disclosure of Information**  
The Company does not disclose personal information or non-personally identifiable information collected from visitors to this website. The Company may, however, disclose such information if required by law, and the Company may transfer such information to companies that acquire from the Company lines of business that have been displayed on this website.

**About IP Addresses**  
The Company collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the computers that "serve" up Web pages for viewing by your Web browser -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When guests request pages from this site, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us.
