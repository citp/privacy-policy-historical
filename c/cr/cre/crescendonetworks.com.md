The terms "Crescendo Networks", "we", "us", "our" and "ours" when used in this Privacy Policy means Crescendo Networks Ltd. which includes all its parents, subsidiaries, divisions, branches, and affiliates. 

The terms "you", "your" and "yours" when used in this Privacy Policy means any user of this Web Site.

This Privacy Policy describes Crescendo Networks’ current policies and practices with regard to Personal Data collected by Crescendo Networks through www.crescendonetworks.com ("Web Site"). 

**Collection of Personal Data including e-mail addresses**

We collect the information you give us when you use our Web Site. You may use this Web Site to register to receive additional information or products from us. When you register, we ask you for contact information like your name, postal address and e-mail address. 

We sometimes supplement the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties. For instance, if inaccurate postal or zip codes are received, we will use third party software to fix them. 

**Crescendo Networks Email Marketing Communication Policy**

Crescendo Networks sends promotional email only to:

  *  Customers 
  *  People who have given consent to Crescendo Networks to receive promotional email 
  *  People on rented email lists who have given permission to the list owner to receive third-party promotional email 
  *  People who have not opted out after having received promotional email from us. In each promotional email, we provide an easy and clear way to opt out of future Crescendo Networks email. Opt-out requests using the opt-out link in our emails are processed automatically and go into effect immediately. Opt-out requests sent by email are processed within 10 business days. When sending email to rented email lists, we suppress addresses of those people who have opted out of Crescendo Networks email in the past.



We always disclose our identity in mass email communications, including the address of our headquarters location.

We never use deceiving header information or subject lines.

We never send mass, promotional email to email addresses “harvested” from websites.

We never, under any circumstances, rent or sell email addresses to any other company or individual.

When coordinating with our resellers for the purpose of follow-up on sales inquiries made to us, we provide full contact information of the inquirer to the reseller, including email address, so the reseller can follow up on the inquiry.

Our marketing email policy and practice fully conforms to the United States Federal “CAN SPAM” act that went in to effect on January 1, 2004. Note that some regions such as the European Union, have different email laws and guidelines, and Crescendo Networks conforms to local laws in those cases. We welcome and encourage your thoughts on this policy at [marketing @crescendonetworks.com](mailto:marketing@crescendonetworks.com). 

**Use of Personal Data**

We process your Personal Data only for specific and limited purposes. We ask only for data that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for those purposes. When we ask you for Personal Data, we tell you the purposes for which we will process that data. 

Some of these purposes include the following:

  *  We may contact you occasionally to inform you of new services we will be providing, or special offers, events or articles we think will be of interest to you. 
  *  We may send you regular updates by e-mail or by post on Crescendo Networks organized or related events. 
  * We may send you requested product information and promotional material. 
  *  We may use your Personal Data for marketing purposes and market research. 
  *  We may use your Personal Data internally to help us improve our products and services and to help resolve any problems. 



**Disclosure of your Personal Data**

We do not share, sell or distribute your Personal Data with unrelated third parties, except under these limited circumstances:

Personal Data may occasionally be transferred to third parties who act for or on behalf of Crescendo Networks, or in connection with the business of Crescendo Networks for further processing in accordance with the purposes for which the data was originally collected or for purposes to which you have subsequently consented. For example, sometimes a third party may have access to your Personal Data in order to handle our mailings on our behalf.

  
We may share or transfer the information in our databases to comply with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice, to protect your vital interests, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or this Web Site, to take precautions against legal liability, or in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event.   
Where appropriate, before disclosing Personal Data to a third party, we contractually require the third party to take adequate precautions to protect that data. 

**Anonymous data collected through this Web Site**

In addition to the information we collect as described above, we use technology to collect anonymous information about the use of our Web Site. This technology does not identify you personally; it simply enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and their use of our Web Site. 

We use this anonymous data to improve the content and functionality of this Web Site and our e-mail updates, to better understand our customers and markets, and to improve our products and services.

**Cookies**

In order to collect the anonymous data described in the preceding paragraph, we may use "cookies" that collect the first level domain name of the user and the date and time you accessed this Web Site. 

We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web Site. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer on a network, or in this case, the Internet. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information, such as determining how many of our visitors are from outside of the US. 

**Links to other web sites**

This Privacy Policy applies only to www.crescendonetworks.com and to other Crescendo Networks URLs through or from which you have reached this Web Site. This Web Site contains hyperlinks to web sites that are not operated by Crescendo Networks. These hyperlinks are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not imply any endorsement of the activities of these third-party web sites or any association with their operators. We do not control these web sites and are not responsible for their data or privacy practices. We urge you to review any privacy policy posted on any site you visit before using the site or providing any Personal Data about yourself. 

**Transfer of Data Abroad**

Crescendo Networks is a global enterprise and has facilities and databases in different countries. We may, from time to time, transfer your Personal Data to one of our databases in another country. If the level of privacy protection in a country does not comply with recognized international standards, we will ensure that data transferred to our databases in that country are adequately protected and that the transfer of data to third parties in such countries is made pursuant to a contract or other measures providing adequate protection. 

Of course, the Internet is made up of a large number of international connections. If you are visiting this Web Site from a country other than the country in which our server is located (currently, the United States of America), the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting this Web Site and communicating electronically with us, you consent to these transfers.
