				<strong><a name="cookies" id="cookies"></a>Does CreditCards.com use COOKIES to collect information about me?</strong>
				<br>
                A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser when you visit our site. Cookies enable our systems to recognize your computer so that we can provide you with personalized service and features, and to track traffic patterns.

			<p>We employ a third party (Omniture) to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information to evaluate the effectiveness of our websites.

				<a name="secure"></a><strong>How does CreditCards.com SECURE the information collected?</strong>
				<br>
				CreditCards.com has security measures in place and takes reasonable precautions to protect against the loss, misuse, and unauthorized access of your personal information under our control. To help us accomplish this, we adopt the following procedures:			</p>
			
			<ul type="disc">
				<li>Employ internal access controls to ensure that the only people who see your information are those with a need to do so to perform their official duties.</li>
				<li>Train relevant personnel on our privacy and security measures.</li>
				<li>Regularly back up the information we collect online to insure against loss.</li>

			</ul>
			
			<p>
				We use reasonable measures to ensure that all credit card applications listed with CreditCards.com use a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) connection. Provided you are using a SSL enabled browser, your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet when you apply for a credit card at the issuer's website. You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock or key icon in the lower right-hand or left-hand corner of the computer screen appears in the locked position. You will usually only see this icon only when you are filling out an application. In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https".  We are not responsible for the security of data transmitted from your computer to any issuer or other third-party website.   For more information on security, please read our <a href="/SSL-Security.php">Site Security</a> policy.			</p>
