<strong><em>Information We Collect About You </em></strong>

<p>We collect several types of information from and  about users of this Site, including the information described below.</p>

<p><u>Personally Identifiable Information</u></p>

<p>In this Privacy Policy, personally identifiable  information means information that identifies a particular individual, such as  an individual's name, postal address, e-mail address, and phone number. Personally identifiable information does not  include screen names or user names that you may provide to us or through this  Site. The following are certain  situations in which we may collect personally identifiable information from you:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you fill out forms or fields on this Site;</li>
<li>When you communicate with us or request information about us, this Site  and our services, whether via email or other means;</li>
<li>When you participate in online surveys;</li>
<li>When you participate in any of our marketing initiatives, including, contests,  events, or promotions; and</li>
<li>When you participate in forums or provide user generated content or  submissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also possible that we may collect personally identifiable information  about you from sources other than you, such as forums, instant messaging  services, blogs, other users of our products and services and our business  partners. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <u>privacy@creditcards.com</u>.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>

<p>If  you use any functionality on this Site allowing you to send content to a  friend, then please be aware that: (a) we may display your email address to  your friend; and (b) we may use information you provide about your friend to facilitate  the communication and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</u></p>

<p>We may collect demographic information about you such as gender, zip code, and birth date, and information regarding your preferences and  usage. This type of information is not,  by itself, personally identifiable information. However, if we link such information with personally identifiable  information in a manner that identifies a particular individual, then we will  treat all such information as personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p>We may collect non-personally identifiable information about you through a variety of  technical methods, including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Collection  of Usage Details and IP Address.</em>As you navigate through this Site, we may collect details of your visits  to this Site, including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, logs,  the resources that you access, and information about your computer and internet  connection, including your IP address, operating system and browser type. We may use this information for system  administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and  business partners.<strong></strong></li>

<li>Collection  with Cookies. "Cookies" are pieces of information that a website sends to  your computer while you are viewing a website. We may set  and access cookies on your computer to track and store preferential information  about you. You consent to our placement  of cookies on your computer. Please note  that most Internet browsers will allow you to stop cookies from being stored on  your computer and to delete cookies stored on your computer. If you choose to do so, however, your use of  certain aspects of this Site may be restricted. </li>

<li>Collection  with Web beacons."Web beacons" are  electronic images, tags or scripts that allow a website to access cookies and  help track general usage patterns of visitors to a website. Web beacons can recognize certain types of  information, such as cookies, time and date of a page view, and a description  of the page where the Web beacon is placed.  We may use Web beacons to compile information regarding use of this  Site.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>


<p>The information collected through these technical methods, standing alone,  cannot be used to determine your identity. Such information may, however, be combined in a way that makes it become  personally identifiable information. If this happens, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable  information.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong><em>Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information</em></strong></p>

<p><u>Typical Disclosure</u></p>

<p>We may disclose personally identifiable  information:</p>

<ul>
<li>To any person who, in our reasonable judgment, is authorized to receive  your personally identifiable information as your agent, including as a result  of your business dealings with that person (for example, your attorney);</li>

<li>To our third party vendors so that they may provide support for our  internal and business operations, including for the handling of data  processing, data storage, surveys, research, internal marketing, delivery of  promotional and transaction materials, and this Site's maintenance and  security;</li>

<li>To third parties when you (i) engage in certain activities on this Site  that are sponsored by them, such as purchasing products or services offered by  a third party, electing to receive information or communications from a third  party, or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other  programs sponsored in whole or in part by a third party, and/or (ii) respond to  promotional materials from us and you authorize a third party to use your  personally identifiable information to, for example, send you additional  promotional materials, provide you a product or service, or enter you into a  sweepstakes. When we disclose your  personally identifiable information to these third parties, your personally  identifiable information will become permanently subject to the information use  and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be  restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing  of your personally identifiable information;</li>

<li>As required by law or ordered by a court, regulatory, or administrative  agency;</li>

<li>As we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, if we believe that you are  violating any applicable law, rule or regulation, or are otherwise interfering  with another's rights or property, including, without limitation, our rights or  property;</li>

<li>If requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or  instance of local, regional or national emergency;</li>

<li>To enforce our <a href="/terms.php">Terms of Use</a>, this Privacy Policy, and any other applicable  agreements and policies;</li>

<li>To enforce or protect our rights;</li>

<li>In connection with a Business Transfer, as defined below (see <em><a href="#pos2">Business Transfers</a></em> below); and </li>

<li>To our affiliated companies (i.e., companies under common control or management with us). </li>
</ul>



<p><u>Aggregation and De-Personalization</u></p>

<p>We may take your personally identifiable information and make it  non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about  other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other  individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the  information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your  information). We may use and/or disclose  to third parties such aggregate or de-personalized information in any manner and  without notice or compensation to you.</p>

<p><u>Requests  for Quotes and Services from Requested Service Providers</u></p>

<p>Certain portions of this  Site may allow you to request a quote, services or information from one or more  third parties, such as insurance providers ("Requested Service  Providers"). If you provide your  personally identifiable information on the Site and request a quote, services  or information from Requested Service Providers (e.g., by clicking  "Submit" or "get your quotes") (a "Request"), we may share,  loan, rent or sell your personally identifiable information to our affiliates, Requested  Service Providers that we match with your Request, your current provider, or to  other third parties that may match you with a Requested Service Provider. In addition, the Requested Service Providers  and such third may further disclose, share and use any personally identifiable  information provided by you in connection with your Request. If you make a Request, you expressly consent  to such disclosure and use of your personally identifiable information. <strong>If you do not want your personally  identifiable information shared as described above, then you should not submit  a Request. </strong> </p>
<strong>IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE  PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA TELEPHONE, FAX, AND  EMAIL. YOU MAY RECEIVE TELEMARKETING  CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A REQUEST ON THIS SITE, EVEN IF YOU ARE ON  THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY. </strong><p></p>


<p>If you are  matched with Requested Service Providers, you expressly consent to the Requested  Service Providers conducting any research necessary to provide you with quotes  for your Request. Requested Service  Providers may need to share your personally identifiable information to conduct  such research. As an example, if you  request insurance quotes, consumer reports may be ordered in connection with  your insurance application. Such reports  may provide information that may assist in determining eligibility for  insurance and the price you may be charged for insurance. Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewal or extensions of  this insurance. In addition, insurance  companies may use third parties in connection with the development of a  "insurance score" for you. <strong>If  you do not want Requested Service Providers to conduct necessary research to  provide you with a quote for your Request, then you should not submit a Request</strong>. </p>


<p><strong>Please  note that if you submit a Request on this Site and we share your information as  described above in connection with your Request, you will not have the  opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of your information in connection with  that Request.</strong></p>

<p><u>Sweepstakes</u></p>

<p>If you are submitting information to us pursuant to a sweepstakes entry, we reserve the right to share, loan, rent and/or sell the information that you  submit with and to our affiliates and other third parties. Please refer to the official  rules and privacy policy for each individual sweepstakes for our specific  policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to that sweepstakes  entry. </p>

<p><u>Circumvention of Security Measures</u></p>

<p>In addition, although we use reasonable security measures to protect the  personally identifiable information we collect through this Site, we cannot  ensure that your personally identifiable information will only be disclosed as  described in this Privacy Policy. By way  of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose  personally identifiable information to the government or third parties under  certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access  transmissions or private communications.  Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary within this Privacy  Policy, the Terms or any other applicable agreement or policy, <u>you use this  Site at your own risk</u> and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should  not expect, that your personally identifiable information will always remain  private. In the unlikely event that an  unauthorized third party compromises our security measures, we will not be  responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized  third party's ability to view, use or disseminate such information.</p>

<p><u>Business Transfers</u><a name="pos2" id="pos2">&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>We specifically and expressly reserve the right to disclose, lease,  sell, assign or transfer your personally identifiable information collected  through this Site, and any of its databases, together with any personally  identifiable information contained in such data bases, to third parties in  connection with a Business Transfer. A  "Business Transfer" means a sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation,  reorganization, bankruptcy or other corporate change involving us and/or our  affiliates, even if the Business Transfer is only being contemplated and  regardless of whether the Business Transfer relates to a part or a whole of our  business. Nothing in this Privacy Policy  is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our  business, equity, and/or assets (including this Site) to an affiliate or  independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation,  without notice, any without any compensation to you, whatsoever.</p>

<p><strong><em>Network Advertising</em></strong></p>

<p>From time to time, we may  participate in or use advertising networks, such as third party advertising  servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and research firms. We may use these third-party advertising  networks for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to  serve advertisements to you. Advertising  networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make  inferences about a consumer's interests and preferences, which enables their  computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer's  specific interests. This practice is  often referred to as "online behavioral advertising." For example, a third-party advertising  network might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type of  computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit,  whether or not you visit specific pages of this Site and other websites, the  location of your Internet service provider's presence, the date and time of a  visit to a website and other interactions between you and website. Please see the "Online Behavioral  Advertising" subsection of <a href="#pos3">Choices About How We Use and Collect Your Information</a> below to read about how you can prevent certain third-party  advertising networks from collecting information about you.</p>

<p><strong><em>Social Media Widgets</em></strong></p>
<p>Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button [and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site]. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>

<p><strong><em>User Generated Content</em></strong></p>

<p>You are responsible for any content, including personal information,  that you contribute to be published or displayed ("posted") on this Site, or  that you transmit to other users of this Site (collectively, "User Generated  Content"). Your User Generated Content  is posted on and transmitted to other users of this Site at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users  of this Site with whom you may choose to share your User Generated  Content. We can also not be responsible for  circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on this  Site. As a result, we cannot and do not  guarantee that your User Generated Content will not be viewed by unauthorized  persons. You understand and acknowledge  that, even after removal, copies of your User Generated Content may remain  viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by  other Site users. Proper access and use  of information provided on this Site, including User Generated Content, is  governed by our <a href="/terms.php">Terms of Use</a>.</p>


<p><strong><em>Choices  About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</em></strong><a name="pos3" id="pos3">&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information  you provide to us. Below are some  mechanisms that provide you with control over certain information:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Cookies</em>. If you do not wish us to collect cookies, you  may set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being  sent. If you do so, please note that  some parts of this Site may then be inaccessible or may not function properly.</li>

<li><em>Email Offers from Us.</em> If you do not  wish to receive email offers or newsletters from us, you can opt-out of  receiving email information from us (other than emails related to the  completion of your registration, correction of user data, change of password  and other similar communications essential to your transactions on this Site)  by using the unsubscribe process at the bottom of the email.</li>

<li><em>Accessing and Correcting Personal Information</em>. If this Site  allows you to create an account with us, then you can review and update your  personal information by logging into this Site, visiting your account profile  page and making changes.</li>
