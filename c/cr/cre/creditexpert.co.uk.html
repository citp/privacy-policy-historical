				</p>
				<h2>What types of information do we collect about you and how do we use or share 
					this information?</h2>
				<p>
					The primary reason we collect personal and credit information about you is to 
					provide products and services that you have requested and to enrol you into our 
					membership services. The type of information we collect, and the primary 
					purpose for which it is collected includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Required product registration information such as name, address(es), and date 
					of birth, are utilised to establish your membership or one-time transaction 
					record and to verify your identify. We require this verification in order to 
					provide you with your personal credit information. For security reasons and to 
					protect the confidentiality of your information, we will verify your identity 
					by checking details you supply against details about you held on other 
					databases to which we have access for these purposes. A record of this check 
					will be kept and, with your consent, may be used by other organisations for 
					verification and fraud prevention purposes;
					</li><li>
					Credit information we receive from credit reporting agencies is utilised to 
					provide you with the products and services we offer;
					</li><li>
					Billing information, such as credit card (or other payment card) number, is 
					required to process the payment for the products and services you order from 
					us;
					</li><li>
					Other information we collect, such as place of birth and mother's maiden name, 
					is used to verify your identity in the event you forget your CreditExpert 
					monitoring service identification or password required for our CreditExpert 
					monitoring service.
					</li><li>
					Your Alerts: As a CreditExpert member we will alert you to significant changes 
					to your credit report via e-mail. When you initially register with CreditExpert 
					you can choose to receive alerts by text message (SMS) if you prefer. As a 
					member, you can update these preferences in the ‘Update my details´ 
					section of your member centre.
					</li><li>
					Any additional credit information you provide to us including (but not limited 
					to) aliases, previous names and addresses and financial relationships with 
					third parties will be added and recorded on your credit report and may be used 
					by us to provide credit reports about you to authorised third parties.
				</li></ul>
				<p>
					If we are unable to verify your identity from the information you provide to us 
					on this web site we will advise you by e-mail to the e-mail address you specify 
					and you may then wish to make a written application including further proof of 
					identification.</p>
				<p>
					In addition to the primary purposes listed above we may also use the 
					information we collect about you as set out in the section entitled "DO WE 
					SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES" below or for other authorised secondary 
					purposes such as:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					creating a profile about you so that we can better inform you and others about 
					particular goods, services or events that may be of interest to you/them and to 
					display that information according to your/their preferences.
					</li><li>
					dealing with your requests and enquiries
					</li><li>
					maintaining our records and for other administrative purposes
					</li><li>
					carrying out customer and market/marketing research
					</li><li>
					tracking activity on our website
					</li><li>
					protecting our websites and systems against unauthorised access
					</li><li>
					improving the quality of our service
				</li></ul>
				<h2>Do we share information with third parties?</h2>
				<p>
					We may disclose any of the information that we collect to other companies 
					within Experian's group of companies and to those third parties referred to 
					above in the section. Except as provided below, we do not share information 
					with any other third party.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					When identifying methods of improving our products and services or if we think 
					a product may be of interest to you, we may arrange to extend offers of goods 
					or services to you.
					</li><li>
					In addition, we may disclose all of the information we collect, as described 
					above, to companies that perform services on our behalf such as credit card 
					processors, data management firms or call centre providers and data may be 
					hosted outside the European Economic Area by such companies.
					</li><li>
					We may use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements about our 
					products and services on our behalf.
					</li><li>
					If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, we will 
					record this and details will be passed to the other fraud prevention agencies.
					</li><li>
					Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.
					</li><li>
						We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent 
						fraud and money laundering, for example, when:
						<ul class="indentbullet">
							<li>
							Checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other 
							facilities
							</li><li>
							Managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities
							</li><li>
							Recovering debt
							</li><li>
							Checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance
							</li><li>
							Checking details of job applicants and employees
						</li></ul>
					</li><li>
					Please contact us at Experian Ltd, PO Box 8000, Nottingham, NG80 7WF if you 
					want to receive details of the fraud prevention agencies.
					</li><li>
					We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the 
					information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.
				</li></ul>
				<p>
					This web site may contain links for other offers and services that we feel you 
					may have an interest in. We believe these sites share a similar commitment to 
					consumer privacy and urge you to review their privacy policy when visiting 
					their sites. We cannot, however, be responsible for their privacy and data use 
					practices.</p>
				<h2>Cookies</h2>
				<p>
					Cookies and similar devices such as web bugs may be used by us to provide you 
					with information from our web site. A cookie is an element of data that a web 
					site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. We use 
					cookies to help us understand volumes of visitors looking at particular web 
					pages and advertisements to help us determine how frequently particular pages 
					are visited and to determine the most popular areas of our web site. Cookies 
					may also allow us to make our web site more stable so that we can give you a 
					better and more user friendly experience when you return to our web site, for 
					example, allowing us to save your password so that you do not have to re-enter 
					it every time you visit our web site. We do not use cookies to record other 
					information on individuals. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. You 
					do not have to accept cookies and you should read the information that came 
					with your browser software to see how you can set up your browser to notify you 
					when you receive cookies, this will give you the opportunity to decide whether 
					to accept it. If you chose to disable cookies you may not be able to access 
					certain features of a particular web site.</p>
				<h2>Marketing options</h2>
				<p>
					We will tell you about significant changes to your credit report, 
					credit-related news, and member offers. YOU WILL ONLY RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS 
					FROM CREDITEXPERT.</p>
				<p>All of our communications will give you the opportunity to unsubscribe.</p>
				<h2>How do we protect your information?
				</h2>
				<p>
					We restrict access to your personal data to those employees, and third parties, 
					who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We 
					maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your 
					personal data.</p>
				<p>
					Experian protects your information over the Internet by using secure web server 
					technologies, which allows web browser programs (Netscape or Microsoft Internet 
					Explorer) to interact with Experian's web server via an encrypted session. 
					Experian employs a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection that provides an 
					encrypted connection between your computer and Experian. The 128 bit encrypted 
					connection scrambles ordinary text or data into cyphertext to safeguard 
					sensitive information during its journey across the Internet. The information 
					is decrypted, or put back into a readable format, when it reaches its intended 
					destination. When you visit the CreditExpert Web site you may move in and out 
					of secured areas. Any time that you are on a registration page or viewing your 
					personal credit report, you will be in a secured area.</p>
				<h2>Privacy policy changes</h2>
				<p>
					Our Privacy Policy will be reviewed and enhanced from time to time and you 
					should check this page regularly to see our most up to date policy. If 
					necessary we will inform you and obtain your consent about any significant 
					changes to the policy.</p>
				<h2>Data transfers</h2>
				<p>
					Because we operate throughout the world in providing our goods and services, 
					this may involve us transferring your personal information to countries whose 
					data protection laws do not provide the same level of protection as those in 
					the UK. If we do so, we will ensure that an agreement is in place in which 
					anyone to whom we pass the information agrees to treat it with the same level 
					of protection as if we were dealing with it.</p>
				<h2>Third parties</h2>
				<p>
					We may supplement the information that you provide to us with information that 
					we receive from third parties.</p>
				<p>
					We will also disclose your information</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					To antifraud agencies;
					</li><li>
					Organisations who search details about you with your consent;
					</li><li>
					Where required to do so by law.
				</li></ul>
				<h2>Your rights to access your personal information</h2>
				<p>
					You have the right to receive information about the personal data we hold about 
					you (for which we may charge a small fee). The statutory fee is £10.00, except 
					in the case of obtaining a copy of your credit report, for which the statutory 
					fee is £2.00.</p>
