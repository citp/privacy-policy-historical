is crucial in developing and maintaining the public trust essential for our 
continued success. We are sensitive to your privacy concerns, and are committed

<h2 class="subTitle">what types of information do we collect about you and how do we use or share this information?</h2>
			
<p class="main">
The primary reason we collect personal and credit information about you is to 
provide products and services that you have requested and to enroll you into 
our membership services. The type of information we collect, and the primary 
purpose for which it is collected includes: </p>
			
<ul class="staticContent">
<li>
Required product registration information such as name, address(es), and date 
of birth, are utilised to establish your membership or one-time transaction 
record and to verify your identify. We require this verification in order to 
provide you with your personal credit information. For security reasons and to 
protect the confidentiality of your information, we will verify your identity 
by checking details you supply against details about you held on other 
databases to which we have access for these purposes. A record of this check 
will be kept and, with your consent, may be used by other organisations for 
verification and fraud prevention purposes;</li>
<li>
Credit information we receive from credit reporting agencies is utilised to 
provide you with the products and services we offer;</li>
<li>
Billing information, such as credit card (or other payment card) number, is 
required to process the payment for the products and services you order from 
us;</li>
<li>
Other information we collect, such as place of birth and mother's maiden name, 
is used to verify your identity in the event you forget your CreditExpert 
monitoring service identification or password required for our CreditExpert 
monitoring service. Any e-mail address or mobile phone number provided by you 
will be recorded by us and used to send you notifications and our latest 
e-newsletter via electronic mail or mobile phone;</li>
<li>
Any additional credit information you provide to us including (but not limited 
to) aliases, previous names and addresses and financial relationships with 
third parties will be added and recorded on your credit report and may be used 
by us to provide credit reports about you to authorised third parties.</li>
</ul> 
			
<p class="main">
If we are unable to verify your identity from the information you provide to us 
on this web site we will advise you by e-mail to the e-mail address you specify 
and you may then wish to make a written application including further proof of 
identification.</p>
			
<p class="main">
In addition to the primary purposes listed above we may also use the 
information we collect about you as set out in the section entitled "DO WE 
SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES" below or for other authorised secondary 
purposes such as: </p>
		
<ul class="staticContent">
<li>
creating a profile about you so that we can better inform you and others about 
particular goods, services or events that may be of interest to you/them and to 
display that information according to your/their preferences.</li>
<li>
dealing with your requests and enquiries</li>
<li>
maintaining our records and for other administrative purposes</li>
<li>
carrying out customer and market/marketing research</li>
<li>

<li>
improving the quality of our service</li>
</ul>

We may disclose any of the information that we collect to other companies 
within the Group and to those third parties referred to above in the section. 
Except as provided below, we do not share information with any other third 
party. </p>
			
<ul class="staticContent">
<li>
When identifying methods of improving our products and services or if we think 
a product may be of interest to you, we may arrange to extend offers of goods 
or services to you.</li>
<li>
In addition, we may disclose all of the information we collect, as described 
above, to companies that perform services on our behalf such as credit card 
processors, data management firms or call centre providers and data may be 
hosted outside the European Economic Area by such companies.</li>
<li>
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements about our 
products and services on our behalf.</li>
</ul>

<p class="main">
We will check your details with the records we hold and share with other fraud 
prevention agencies. If you provide false or inaccurate information and we 
suspect fraud, we will record this. If you want to receive  details of those fraud prevention agencies from whom we obtain and with whom we record information about you, write to us at Experian Ltd, PO Box 8000, Nottingham, NG80 7WF. You have a legal right to these details.</p>
