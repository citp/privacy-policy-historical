<div id="ugc"><h2><strong>Privacy</strong></h2>
<p>We, Creative Skillset Sector Skills Council Limited (<strong>we</strong> / <strong>us</strong> / <strong>our</strong>), are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy and Cookies Policy (the <strong>Policy</strong>) (together with our <a href="/terms_and_conditions" title="Terms and conditions">Terms and Conditions</a>&nbsp;and any other documents referred to in these documents) explains how we use any personal information about you (<strong>you</strong> / <strong>your</strong>) that we collect when you use the Creative Skillset website (<a href="http://www.creativeskillset.org/" title="Creative Skillset website">www.creativeskillset.org</a>) and any of our other online products, sub-sites and all other websites owned, operated and controlled by us (collectively, the <strong>Website</strong>). Please read these documents carefully. Defined words used in the Terms and Conditions shall have the same meaning when used in this Policy. References to a “parent” include a legal guardian.</p>
<p>By using the Website (and in particular by submitting your personal information to us via the Website or, if you are a parent, by consenting for your child to do the same), you consent to the collection, storage and use of your or, as applicable, your child’s personal information as described in this Policy. If you are a parent allowing your child to use the Website, references in this Policy to “your personal information” shall be to your child’s personal information.</p>
<h3><strong>Data protection compliance</strong></h3>
<p>The Website is controlled by us from our offices in the United Kingdom (<strong>UK</strong>).&nbsp; Personal information collected via the Website is processed in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998 (<strong>Act</strong>). For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998, we are registered as a data controller (our registration number is Z8941934) and our data protection officer is Reiz Evans, Head of Operations, available at <a href="mailto:reize@creativeskillset.org" title="Link opens in a new window.">reize@creativeskillset.org</a>.</p>
<p>If you choose to visit the Website from outside the UK, you do so at your own risk, with the understanding that personal information collected from the Website may be collected, stored and used in a country whose privacy laws may be different and less protective than those of your home country.</p>
<p>If you are under the age of 18, please get permission from your parent before you provide personal information through the Website.</p>
<h3><strong>Collection of your personal information</strong></h3>
<p>In operating the Website we may collect and process the following data about you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Details of your visits to      the Website and the resources that you access, including, but not limited      to, the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your device to the      internet, traffic data, location data, page interaction information (such      as scrolling, clicks and mouse-overs), your operating system and platform,      your login information, weblogs and other communication data.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Information that you provide by filling      in forms on the Website, such as when you register for information, sign      up for an account,&nbsp; make a purchase,      or when you apply for a training programme delivered by us or one of our      partners. </li>
<li>Information provided to      us when you communicate with us for any reason, whether via email, letter,      through the Website or via our helpline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal information collected by Creative Skillset is often limited to contact details and some basic information about your area of work and employment status, but may include other information necessary to provide a particular service you have requested.</p>
<p>Sensitive data may include data about your ethnic origin, nationality, gender, membership of a trade union or association, employment status, sexual orientation, caring responsibilities, number of children and, in some cases, your socio-economic background. If you are under 18 you will need to ensure your parent provides us with their consent for you to provide sensitive data about yourself.</p>
<p>If you are applying for a service for which government funding is available, you may need to answer certain additional questions such as your age and your current education and employment status, in order for us to evaluate whether you are eligible for that funding. By providing your information to Creative Skillset, you explicitly give your consent for us to process your personal and sensitive data. However, when we collect sensitive personal data through the Website, we will ask you to consent to our uses of the data, and you may choose not to give us this consent if you so desire. Wherever the provision of information is optional, this will be made clear.</p>
<p>We will treat any information we collect in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<h3><strong>Cookies and user tracking</strong></h3>
<p>A "cookie" is a small text file deposited on your computer's hard drive when you access a website. Please read the section on cookies below, which sets out details of the cookies used on the Website.</p>
<h3><strong>How we use your information</strong></h3>
<p>The information that we collect and store relating to you is primarily used to enable us to provide our services to you. In addition, we may use some or all of the information about you for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide you with      information requested from us (such as event invitations, publications or      e-newsletters) or information on other products or services (including      general updates about Creative Skillset or our partner organisations) which      we feel may be of interest to you, where you have consented to receive      such information.</li>
<li>To meet our contractual      commitments to you.</li>
<li>To notify you about any      changes to the Website, such as improvements or service/product changes,      that may affect our service.</li>
<li>To deal with your comment      or query, and to contact you for more information regarding a comment or      query you have made.</li>
<li>To arrange and deliver      services you have requested, whether online, one-to-one or via the      telephone.</li>
<li>To      administer our site and for internal operations including troubleshooting,      data analysis, testing, research, and surveys. </li>
<li>To generate anonymous      statistics to help us improve the services we offer to you (these      statistics will not include information that can identify you as an      individual).&nbsp;Sometimes we may ask you whether we can keep personal      sensitive data linked to an individual learning record. This can happen      when we want to monitor the progress of individuals from different      backgrounds through and beyond a training programme. It may also occur      when we are required to share you data with a funding organisation (like      the Skills Funding Agency) or a training provider partner. Giving personal      sensitive information is always voluntary and we will explicitly ask your      permission and/or your parent’s permission to share it, and any reported      statistics based on it will still be anonymous.</li>
<li>To ensure that the Equal      Opportunities Policy is effective, a monitoring of applications, approvals      and placements&nbsp;is carried out. The collected sensitive information      regarding your gender, age, ethnic group, sexual orientation, caring      responsibilities and in some cases socio-economic background,&nbsp;and any      disability you may have, is used solely for monitoring purposes and will      be treated as confidential.</li>
<li>To pre-populate forms on      the Website requesting information you have already provided, for your convenience      and ease-of-use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Occasionally, we (or trusted third parties carefully selected by us) may wish to send you information about our (and/or their) products, services and activities.&nbsp; Before you are sent any such information, we will ask whether you wish to receive such information.&nbsp; If you confirm that you do wish to receive such information and/or your parent confirms to us that it is OK for you to receive such information, you are consenting to the use of your personal information (and, if applicable, the sharing of it with such trusted third parties) for that purpose. If you confirm that you do not wish to receive such information, we will not use your personal information, and we will not share it with such trusted third parties, for that purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by email (see below for details of how to contact us).</p>
<h3>Storing your personal data</h3>
<p>All information you provide to us is stored, usually within the UK or other parts of the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>), on secure servers hosted by us or third parties providing hosting or other services for us.</p>
<p>We store application details including personal, sensitive data in electronic forms which are filed on our secure intranet. Hard copies of application forms are stored in lockable cabinets in a secure office environment.</p>
<p>The information we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the EEA, including destinations where the privacy laws of the country concerned may be different and less protective than those of EEA countries. It may also be processed by personnel operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such personnel may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services.</p>
<p>By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storage and processing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We take every reasonable precaution to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information and to ensure that it will be processed in accordance with this Policy. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of data sent to us electronically. &nbsp;You acknowledge and accept that, despite our efforts to protect your personal information, there is a risk that others may try to intercept the personal information you provide to us. Transmission of your information is entirely at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password so that you can access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.</p>
<h3><strong>Disclosing and sharing your information</strong></h3>
<p>We will not disclose your personal information to third parties, except where the data may be provided to a third party company, such as a mailing house or web agency, for the sole purpose of delivering a service on Creative Skillset's behalf (provided you, or your parent if you are a child, have consented to this).</p>
<p>Your personal data - your name address, contact details etc. - will only be shared with partners or funders connected by contract with the training opportunity you have applied for. Where we need to share it with a specific organisation, e.g. the Skills Funding Agency, we will ask your (or, if you are a child, your parent’s) permission to do so.<br> <br> Your sensitive data, concerning characteristics such as your gender, ethnicity, disability or sexual orientation is always asked for on a voluntary basis - you can choose not to say - and diversity statistics gathered through our monitoring systems are always reported anonymously.</p>
<h3><strong>Course information and third party links</strong></h3>
<p>Creative Skillset has taken care to ensure that the information on the website is correct. However, no warranty, express or implied, is given as to its accuracy and Creative Skillset does not accept any liability for error or omission. Creative Skillset is not responsible for how the information is used, how it is interpreted or what reliance is placed on it. We do not guarantee that the information on the website is fit for any particular purpose. You should also be aware that the availability of courses of study is subject to conditions applied by individual institutions at their sole discretion.</p>
<p>You will find links to third party websites on the Website. These third party websites should have their own privacy policies which you should check before you submit any personal data. We are not responsible and do not accept any liability for the privacy practices or content of such websites. Creative Skillset does not endorse any of the products or services of third party organisations contained within its sites unless expressly stated.</p>
<h3><strong>Access to information</strong></h3>
<p>The Data Protection Act 1998 gives you the right to know whether we hold information about you, and also to access that information and require it to be corrected if it is inaccurate. To request access to your information, or if you wish to be removed from our database at any time, please contact Reiz Evans, Head of Operations at <a href="mailto:reize@creativeskillset.org" title="Link opens in a new window.">reize@creativeskillset.org</a>. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information about you that we hold.</p>
<p>Anyone subscribing to receive information from Creative Skillset can unsubscribe from receiving such information at any time, either by following the unsubscribe instructions sent with all electronic communications, or by e-mailing <a href="mailto:reize@creativeskillset.org" title="Link opens in a new window.">reize@creativeskillset.org</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Freedom of information</strong></h3>
<p>The Freedom of Information Act 2000 (<strong>FOA</strong>) provides public access to information held by public authorities. It does this in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public authorities      are obliged to publish certain information about their activities; and</li>
<li>Members of the      public are entitled to request information from public authorities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The FOA covers any recorded information that is held by a public authority in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and by UK-wide public authorities based in Scotland. Information held by Scottish public authorities is covered by Scotland's own Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002.</p>
<p>Creative Skillset is not a public body, and therefore is not directly subject to the FOA. The list of public bodies covered by the FOA can be found <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/section/3">here</a>. We will respond to requests for information from members of the public, where the provision of information in response to such an enquiry does not adversely affect Creative Skillset or its stakeholders. This is entirely at the discretion of Creative Skillset, and we are in no way compelled by the FOA to respond to such requests.</p>
<p>All Freedom of Information requests should be sent to&nbsp;Reiz Evans, Head of Operations at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:reize@creativeskillset.org" title="Link opens in a new window.">reize@creativeskillset.org</a>.</p>
