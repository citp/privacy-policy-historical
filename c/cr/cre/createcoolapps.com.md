OVERALL POLICIES:

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information, as well as to protect against fraud. We track IP addresses on all order forms for this reason.

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your user log in. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, possibly to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other purposes such as for affiliate tracking and site membership.

Our site’s registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and in some instances, unique identifiers (like their social security number). We may use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company and promotional material in the form of newsletter or website ads. We do not share our client’s private information with our partners or any advertisers.

The customer’s contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings. Opt Out information is on every mailing we send. Unique identifiers (such as social security numbers) are collected to verify the user’s identity and for use as account numbers in our affiliate record system.
