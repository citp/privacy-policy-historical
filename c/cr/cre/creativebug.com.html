  <h1>Creativebug’s Website Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p class="revision-stamp">
    Creativebug, Inc.<br>
    www.creativebug.com<br>
    Website Privacy Policy<br>
    Revised as of October 8, 2013
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to the www.creativebug.com network of websites and Applications (the “Site”) of Creativebug, a Demand Media property (“Creativebug,” also referred to herein as “us,” “we” and “our”). Thank you for your interest in using our services (“Services”) and tangible products (separately, “Products,” and collectively “Offerings”).</p> 

<p>We have created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy’) to demonstrate our commitment to the privacy of visitors to our Site and our registered users.</p>

<p>We are committed to respecting your privacy and recognizing your need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information (“PII”) you share with us. PII and the phrases “personally identifiable information” and “personal information” mean any information by which you, individually, can be identified (e.g., your name, address, zip code, telephone number, etc.). The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you when you visit our Site how we use such information, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to review and correct, your information.</p>

<p>BY USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE.</p>

<h2>A Special Notice About Children</h2>

<p>Children (under the age of 18) are not eligible to use the Site. In any event, children should not submit any PII to us. If you are under the age of 18, you may not use the Site or any of our Offerings. We abide by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and do not knowingly solicit or collect personally identifiable information from children younger than age thirteen (13). If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with PII without their consent, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@demandmedia.com">legal@demandmedia.com</a>.</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>You may visit the home page and certain pages of the Site without revealing any personal information about yourself. We may automatically collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your computer configuration, browser type, operating system, Internet domain address from which you visit the Site (IP address or ISP domain name), and navigational and clickstream data that shows what pages are visited and how long various features are used.</p>

<h2>Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

<h3>What information is collected</h3>

<p>When you register with us or request or receive an Offering, however, the general information described above may be linked to you personally. When you register with us, we will also ask you to provide certain PII, which may include but is not necessarily limited to your name, address, country, company, email address, and a password. We may also collect additional information such as your location, demographic, preferences and interests. When you purchase an Offering, we will ask for credit card information (name, number, expiration date and access code), and other information necessary to complete the transaction. We may maintain a record of your online purchases, if any. If you post materials on the Site with certain PII (e.g., your name), we may post such PII; and we may link your postings with other PII (e.g., your account with us) for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Whether or not you choose to provide the information we request is entirely up to you. But if you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to access certain Services, Products offers, and content on the Site.</p>

<p>Some features of the Services may allow you to connect, link or access the Services via a third-party platform (e.g., a social network such as Facebook or Twitter). Information you decide to share with a third-party platform is subject to that third party’s privacy policy and information practices. Any information we receive from such third-party platforms from which you choose to connect, link or access the Services is subject to this Privacy Policy. Please visit each such third-party platform’s privacy policy to better understand the applicable data collection practices and the permission controls available.</p>

<p>Our Site may also contain plug-ins from third-party platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter. You will be able to recognize such third-party plug-ins based on their logos. When you visit our Site, or interact with the plug-ins, any information collected and used by those third-party platforms is subject to their respective privacy policies.</p>

  <h3>How your information is used</h3> 

<p>We may use any of the information described in this Privacy Policy to establish user accounts; provide the Offerings, including supporting and completing the transactions or other requested activity; communicate with you regarding your subscription or account; provide you with information you have requested, news and updates, and information about Offerings (including Products and Services that may suit your particular interests); customize and personalize content to you; administer and run the Site, and comply with legal requirements. We also use your personal information to help identify you if you lose your password and to help you quickly find information on the Site.  We may use your email address to send commercial or marketing messages to you related to the Services or Offerings.</p>

<p>We may collect financial and/or billing information, such as a payment method and credit card number associated with your personal identity. We may provide this information to a third-party payment clearing house service and use this information to facilitate payment to or by us or as otherwise described above. We, or third parties working on our behalf, use industry-standard security measures to protect the transmission and storage of the information you submit to us when you use our online forms.</p>

<p>However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. For example, as with email generally, email that you send us is not necessarily secure against interception. YOU AGREE THAT CREATIVEBUG IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INTERCEPTED INFORMATION SENT VIA EMAIL, AND HEREBY RELEASE US FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE UNAUTHORIZED INTERCEPTION OR USE OF EMAILED INFORMATION.</p>

<h2>Sharing your information with third parties</h2>

<p>We respect the privacy interests of our registered users. Consequently, as of the Revision Date shown above, Creativebug does not rent, sell or exchange PII to others for marketing purposes without your express, affirmative consent (e.g., by “opting in”). If you do so consent, registered users of the Site who are California residents may request certain information regarding the Company’s disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes by writing to <a href="mailto:legal@demandmedia.com">legal@demandmedia.com</a></p>

<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliates, partners and with third-party independent contractors such as unaffiliated service providers, possibly including third parties that reside in jurisdictions with less restrictive data laws than your own jurisdiction, for purposes that include: (i) hosting the Site; (ii) approving and enabling your use of the Site and use or purchase of our Offerings, and performing other functions on our behalf; (iii) providing you with our own service or product offers; and (iv) tracking information generated through the Site. Our partners and third-party independent contractors are obligated contractually not to use or share your personal information for unauthorized purposes. This means we generally restrict access to PII to our qualified employees and agents with a need to know in order to perform their respective duties. (Our “agents” may include third-party service providers.) </p> 

<p>We may also disclose your personal information to comply with a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process; to comply with legal, regulatory or administrative requirements of any governmental authorities; to protect and defend Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates (if any), and their officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, contractors, and partners, in connection with any legal action, claim or dispute; to enforce the Terms and Conditions of Use of the Site, including without limitation this Privacy Policy; to prevent imminent physical harm; and in the event that we find that your actions on the Site violate any laws, or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services.</p>

<p>We may transfer part or all of your information in the case of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale of all or a portion of our assets or stock.</p>

<h2>Reviewing and requesting changes to your information</h2>

<p>If you would like to modify your PII on our database, please log onto your account by clicking the “Login” link on the website. Registered Users of the Site may modify their privacy settings, and may correct, modify and update their PII prospectively at any time by logging into their account and making their desired changes. Registered users may also “unregister” or by asking that their registration information be deleted, in which case we will remove them from our list of registered users. Notwithstanding the above, we reserve the right to retain PII in our archival files until we determine there is no potential need for such information. We may retain such information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms and conditions of use. In addition, it may not be technologically possible or feasible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us. A copy of your personal information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Removed information may also persist in backup copies.</p>

<p>Where you make use of the social networking and online features of the Site to share information with other individuals on the Site (such as but not limited to submitting comments or questions via feedback, posting photos or other materials on the Site, or submitting an entry to a contest or poll) it may not be possible or practical for us to remove such communications and materials or any associated PII, and such communications, materials, and information may persist, including on third-party computers and other media.</p> 

<p>Any questions you may have regarding this Policy, the accuracy of your personal information or the use of your personal information, or any requests that we correct, update, or remove your information in our databases, should be directed via email to <a href="mailto:legal@demandmedia.com">legal@demandmedia.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Use of Technology</h2>

<h3>Cookies, Shared Objects and Pixel Tags</h3>

<p>Like many other online services, we collect and store information about your usage of our Services, such as when and how you use the Site and Offerings, the information you display or access on the Site (including UI elements, settings, and other information), the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using, the date and time you access the Site, browser type and language, and the Internet address of the website(s) from which you linked to the Site. We use this information to track and analyze the traffic through the Site in order to better understand our users and to customize the Services, Site, Offerings, and our marketing efforts on and off the Site. If you are logged in, we may associate this information with your account. In the same manner, we may also engage third parties to monitor the usage of the Services and the Site. These third parties may use similar technologies to collect information to better understand our users, customize the Services, Site, Offerings, and our marketing efforts on and off the Site.</p>

<p>Such technologies may include cookies, shared objects and pixel tags (also known as web beacons or web bugs). Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are placed onto your computer's hard drive. Cookies identify your computer so that we can recognize you the next time you visit us. Cookies help us remember your preferences and collect technical information about your use of the Services. No PII is collected or used by our cookies. Pixel tags are tiny graphic images that are unobtrusively placed on a website or in an e-mail. When the HTML code for a pixel tag points to a website to retrieve the image, it simultaneously passes information to our servers, such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time and duration a pixel tag was viewed, the type of browser that retrieved the image, and previously set cookie values. We use pixel tags to help us analyze your use of the Services, including the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with the Services.</p>

<p>You can configure your browser to alert you when a website is attempting to send a cookie to your computer and allow you to accept or refuse the cookie and you may also disable cookies. You do this through your browser (e.g., Internet Explorer) settings. Check your browser's Help menu to find out how. You should be aware, however, that by disabling cookies, shared objects and/or pixel tags, you may be unable to access certain services and features of the Services.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>

<p>The Site contains links to other websites as an accommodation to the respective third-party site owners and for your convenience. Sites linked to and from the Site are not necessarily under our control, and we shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the content or privacy practices of any linked sites, or any link or linking program at any time. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, security practices or the content of such websites. You should check the applicable privacy policy of the website sponsor when linking to other websites.</p>

<h2>Security and Phishing</h2>

<p>We implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information, to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.</p>

<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. Do not share it with others. Creativebug will never ask you for your password. If you need a new user name and/or password, we may require you to follow certain security procedures (such as providing us with certain PII or correctly answering certain security questions). If satisfied, we will generate a new user name and password automatically through our computers and send it to your email. You may never use another's account without permission.
