<p><strong>DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?</strong><br> 
</p><p>
<strong>We do not share information with any non-affiliated third party except:</strong> (1) in select circumstances when a business partner refers you to us and you give us permission to share specific information, such as your name and email address, with that business partner on your order form, or (2) as permitted or required by law, such as inquires by law enforcement or to comply with Federal laws such as the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (CAN-SPAM Act of 2003) or the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA). </p>
<p>If you choose, we may disclose the information that we collect to our affiliated companies from time to time for marketing purposes and to enhance our products to better suit your needs. When identifying methods of improving our products or if we think a product may be of interest to you, we may arrange to extend select special offers of goods or services to you either directly or through affiliates. If you would like to opt-out of having your information shared with partners and/or affiliates, please refer to the section labeled "Offering You Choices - Marketing Options," below.</p>
<p>In order to provide the products you have requested, we may disclose the information we collect to companies that perform services on our behalf such as the credit reporting agencies from which we obtain your credit report(s), credit card processors, e-mail communications management firms or call center providers. Our third party service providers are contractually limited to using the information received from ConsumerInfo.com, Inc. solely for the purposes of providing you with the services you requested.</p>
<p>Our Sites may contain links for other offers that we feel you may have an interest in. We believe these sites share a similar commitment to consumer privacy and urge you to review their privacy policy when visiting their sites. We cannot, however, be responsible for their privacy practices.</p>
