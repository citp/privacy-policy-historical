INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Personal Information

We collect information that you choose to provide us or that you choose to include in your profile or account, and that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, zip code, telephone number, e-mail address, and other personally identifiable information ("Personal Information"). You may be asked to provide us with Personal Information when you register with the Site and at other times. The decision to provide this information is optional. However, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Site or Services.

Usage Data and Site Activity

We automatically collect information in connection with the actions you take on the Site and in connection with using the Services ("Usage Data"). For example, each time you use the Site we automatically collect the type of web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, the pages you view, and the time and duration of your visits to the Site. This anonymous usage information may be associated with your username and profile, but we do not disclose the associated information to third parties.

Cookies and Web Beacons

We may use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser). We also may use web beacons (an electronic file placed on a website that monitors usage). We use cookies and web beacons to improve the experience of the Site and Services, such as pre-populating your username for easier login. We do not use cookies or web beacons to collect Personal Information. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the Site or Services may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Some of our Third-Party Providers and Advertisers (as such terms are defined below), may use their own cookies and web beacons in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.

HOW WE USE INFORMATION AND WHEN WE MAY SHARE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION

Generally

We use Personal Information for internal purposes, such as to provide you with the Site and Services, to improve the Site and Services, to notify you of new services, and to otherwise communicate with you about the Site, the Services, CRTV, the Company and other matters. We will not disclose Personal Information to third parties, including for their direct marketing purposes, without your consent, except as explained in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose to third parties certain Usage Data regarding the Site and Services. However, in such cases, your Usage Data is aggregated with the Usage Data of others and does not identify you individually.

Profile Information You Make Available to Others

By using the Site or the Services you may make certain of your Personal Information available to others. For example, if your user name contains your real name, and you post a comment in a public area of the Site, other users may see your name and other information from your public profile that you choose to make available to others, such as your home town. The information you choose to make publicly available may be accessed by users who use the Site or Services and may be accessed by commercial search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and Bing to the extent that such engines are permitted to access the Site.

Third-Party Providers

From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses whom we believe trustworthy and who we believe have privacy practices that are consistent with ours ("Third-Party Providers"). For example, we may contract with Third-Party Providers to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, data storage and management, payment processing, and marketing and promotions. We only provide our Third-Party Providers with the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider is expected to use reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Third-Party Providers are prohibited from using Personal Information other than as specified by the Company.

Advertising

We may work with third-party advertisers, search providers and ad networks ("Advertisers"). We may share Personal Information with third parties whose products and services we think may be of interest to you. If you prefer that we not share your Personal Information with third parties, you may opt out by sending us an email at [support@crtv.com](mailto:support@crtv.com). Please be sure to include your full name, email address, mailing address, and specifically state that you do not want your Personal Information shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

Advertisers may collect and use information about your use of the Site or Services as well as other websites and services in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. These companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as web beacons in order to collect such information. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an ad network may collect from you. Advertisements may be shown via the Site, the Services, or on third-party websites. You can visit the Network Advertising Initiative website at www.networkadvertising.org, which offers information about Internet advertising companies and how to opt-out of their information collection.

Google Analytics Advertising Features

We have implemented certain Google Analytics Advertising Features, including Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, and Remarketing with Google Analytics. We use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie), along with other first-party identifiers, third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) and other third-party identifiers, not only to improve the site experience for our users, but also to aggregate the characteristics and browsing habits of our users, on an anonymous basis, to provide products and services that are more tailored to our users. We also use these types of cookies and identifiers to improve and target our marketing and remarketing efforts and serve ads based on our users' prior visits to our website, also on an anonymous basis. We do not use cookies of any kind to disclose or transmit personally identifiable information. There are a number of ways you can opt-out of the Google Analytics Advertiser Features we use, including via changing your Ads Settings on Google or changing the ads settings on the web browser you are using. You can also use the opt-out tool provided by the Network Advertising Initiative, [here](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/). Google provides a free browser add-on, called the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, which provides website users the ability to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics. The browser add-on may be downloaded [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

Joint Services

We may provide services jointly with other companies. In some cases, in order to facilitate such services, it may be necessary to share your Personal Information with such other companies. Before we do so, we will identify the partner, present the joint service provider's privacy policy to you before you use that service, and obtain your permission to share your Personal Information.

Third-Party Services and Applications

Through the Site and the Services, you may have the ability to elect to access third-party services and applications, such as Facebook and other social networks. When you do so, you may be able to import information from those other services and applications and share content with those services. Some of those third-party services may also provide us with information from your accounts which may enable us to enhance and personalize your use of the Site and Services (e.g., so that you can follow your Facebook friends' activity on the Site or Services). If you elect to use such third-party services or applications through the Services, the information you share with such third-party services and applications will be subject to their privacy policies and your privacy settings for such services. You also may be able to control or block such sharing by changing your privacy settings in such services or applications.

Other Transfers

We may share Personal Information and Usage Data with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Company. If the Company is merged, acquired or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information and Usage Data in connection with such transaction. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if, in our reasonable judgment, the new entity plans to handle your information in a way that differs materially from this Privacy Policy.

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement

The Company cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose Personal Information and any other information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate in order to respond to legal requests (including court orders and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property or rights of the Company or of any third party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.

Sharing Information with Others

Please be aware that whenever you share information on public forums on the Site, that information may be accessed by others. In addition, please remember that when you share information in any other communications with third parties, that information may be passed along or made public by others. This means that anyone with access to such information can potentially use it for any purpose, including sending unsolicited communications.

SECURITY

The Company recognizes the importance of safeguarding the confidentiality of your Personal Information. Accordingly, we employ reasonable measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure and use. However, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through the Site or Services, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the Site or Services, and you do so at your own risk.

CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
