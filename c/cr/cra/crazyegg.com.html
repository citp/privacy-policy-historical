      <p>Last Updated: May 24, 2018</p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Crazy Egg, Inc. (“Crazy Egg”, “we”, “us”, “our”) on our websites located at the domains crazyegg.com, crazyeggvcr.com, and crazyeggproxy.com, as well as such other websites or mobile applications that we own or operate  (individually and collectively, “Our Website” or the “Crazy Egg Website”) .
      </p>
      <h2>Scope of this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          As further discussed, below, data protection laws, regulations, and directives in certain jurisdictions distinguish between the rights and responsibilities of “Controller(s)” of personal information or data (“Information”), from those who are  “Processor(s)” of such Information or data on the applicable controllers’ behalf. Crazy Egg is generally the controller of Information that it collects from and about the persons and entities who are visiting Our Website (“Crazy Egg Visitors”), and this Privacy Policy applies to Crazy Egg Visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also provide certain services to commercial persons and entities (each, a “Client” and collectively, “Clients”), who, in turn, own and operate their own websites or mobile applications (“Client Site(s)”), and who wish to utilize our code, software and services and reports (the “Service(s)”)  to analyze how third party visitors to their Client Sites (“Client Site Visitor(s)”) use, interact with, and engage their Client Sites.  The applicable Clients are the Controllers of Information collected from their Client Site Visitors, whether or not such information is accessed, analyzed, or otherwise utilized by or on behalf of the Client via the Service (“Client Visitor Information”); Crazy Egg is not the Controller of such Client Visitor Information. This Privacy Policy applies to the use of Services by our Clients. However, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the Client Sites themselves, nor to any Client Visitor Information.  For any questions regarding the privacy, security, or other practices or policies on the Client Sites, please contact the applicable Client.
        </p>
        <h3>Information Collected from Crazy Egg Visitors </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Device Information from Crazy Egg Visitors.</strong> We may receive and collect certain Information furnished by the visitor's browser or otherwise by their access device (“Device Information”), such as:
            <ul>
              <li>Browser Information</li>
              <li>Operating System Information</li>
              <li>Mobile Device Information (e.g., device identifier, mobile operating system, etc.)</li>
              <li>IP address (stored in anonymized form)</li>
              <li>Page Accessed</li>
              <li>Geographic Location</li>
              <li>Time of visit (by day, week, and duration)</li>
              <li>Whether the visitor is a new or return visitor</li>
              <li>Other such Information as may be delivered or shared by the applicable browser or access software or device.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Referral Information.</strong> We may also receive certain information regarding visitors from the prior website visited by such visitors (“Referral Information”).  For instance, If a Crazy Egg Visitor navigates to the Crazy Egg Website from another website, Crazy Egg may receive certain information from the referring website (i.e., the last website the visitor visited before visiting the Crazy Egg Website) as part of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ("HTTP") request. For example, if a Crazy Egg Visitor navigates to the Crazy Egg Website from a search engine, Crazy Egg may receive information contained in the referring URL for the applicable search query, such as the terms the Crazy Egg Visitor was searching for before visiting the Crazy Egg Website.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Registration Information from Crazy Egg Clients.</strong> When Crazy Egg Visitors register as Clients to use the Crazy Egg Service, register to use a trial version of the Crazy Egg Service, or request additional information about Crazy Egg, Crazy Egg may require  Information, such as name, e-mail mailing address, phone number, financial information (e.g., credit card number, billing address), and/or proposed Client Site to be tracked, to process the registration or request ("Client Registration Information").

        <h3>Crazy Egg's Sharing and Disclosure of Crazy Egg Visitor Information and Client Visitor Information.</h3>
        <p>
          This section describes the manner and extent to which Crazy Egg may share and disclose Information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary below or elsewhere herein, as between a Client and Crazy Egg, the Client is solely responsible for its policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of Client Visitor Information as the Controller of such Information.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Crazy Egg’s Default Policy Regarding Sharing of Client Visitor Information.</strong> Except to the limited extent described otherwise in this Privacy Policy, Crazy Egg never sells or shares any Client Visitor Information with individuals or companies other than the specific Client from whose Client Site Crazy Egg collected the Client Visitor Information.  This Client Visitor Information is provided to Clients in the form of aggregated reports and/or statistics that identify the collective behavior of Client Visitors to the Client's Site. Clients will also have access to Recorded Interactions through the Service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Crazy Egg’s Default Policy Regarding Sharing of Client’s Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> With the exception of the limited circumstances discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Crazy Egg does not provide Clients' Personally Identifiable Information to third parties for any purpose.

          <li>
            <strong>Disclosure Pursuant to the Client’s Instructions.</strong> Crazy Egg will share and disclose Client Visitor Data in accordance with the applicable Client’s instructions, including any applicable <a href="/terms">Terms</a>, and otherwise in compliance with but subject to applicable laws and regulations.

            <strong>Subprocessors.</strong> We may utilize affiliates or third parties as subprocessors of the Information, to support the Services, and otherwise to support the conduct of our business, to provide, by way of example, service such as computing and storage services. We will use subprocessors subject to contracts that are substantially as protective of Personally Identifiable Information as those contained herein, and, to the extent applicable, in compliance with Article 28(3) of the General Data Protection Regulation. For further information regarding our use of subprocessors, please contact us at privacy@crazyegg.com.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Our Affiliates.</strong> We may share Information hereunder with our corporate affiliates provided that such affiliates are obligated, contractually or otherwise under applicable laws, to be bound by our obligations with respect to such Information.

            <strong>Change of Control.</strong> If Crazy Egg, or substantially all of its assets, is acquired by another company or successor entity, the Information hereunder will be one of the assets transferred or acquired by the purchaser or successor. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any purchaser of or successor to Crazy Egg or its assets may continue to collect, use and disclose your Information as set forth in this policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment Processors.</strong> Like many companies that accept payment by credit card, Crazy Egg relies on third-party payment processors to process financial payments.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Aggregated, Anonymized, Pseudonymized, or De-identified Information.</strong> We may disclose or use aggregated, anonymized, pseudonymized, or otherwise de-identified Information for any purpose.

          Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates.
