We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.

<p><strong>Changes to our Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p><br>
We may occasionally update our Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Third-party websites</strong></p>

<p><br>
There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the privacy link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How you can access your information</strong></p>

<p><br>
If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account and clicking on your account settings. You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us at the email address provided below in the How to contact us section of this privacy policy. More information about how to contact us is provided below.<br>
If you have an online account with us, you also may choose to resign and close your account at any time by visiting the Account Settings page for your account. After you close your account, you will not be able to sign in to our website or access any of your personal information. However, you can open a new, separate account at any time or re-activate your previous account by following instructions we will give you at the time you close your account.

In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Your choices about collection and use of your information</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website.</li>
	<li>At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails from us by visiting the Account Settings page associated with your account. You will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a service provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.</li>
	<li>In certain places on our site we may ask for your phone number. In those places where we ask for your phone number, we will always tell you how your phone number will be used. Only to provide you a service you requested from us. We will not call you for marketing purposes. If you have provided your phone number but no longer wish to be contacted by phone by us, you can visit the Account Settings page associated with your account to let us know your wishes. Please note that we may still need to call you for servicing or other non-marketing purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our information-handling practices, or if you would like to request information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please contact us by e-mail as follows:</p>
