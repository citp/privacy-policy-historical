    <h1>Usage Data</h1>
    All web servers have the ability to automatically collect certain information that a web browser provides. This
    collection ability is commonly referred to as a usage log or a traffic log.<br><br>

    Craiglook's web site collects detail information such as IP address, domain name, browser, date, time and page
    accessed.

    Craiglook monitors all unsuccessful access attempts to our servers. We reserver the right to disable any account or
    IP address/range which repeatedly makes unsuccessful access attempts or, in our judgement, is attempting to bypass
    our security.
    <h1>Client Information</h1>
    Craiglook maintains a database of client information. This information is used only by Craiglook staff for
    communicating with our visitors. None of the information in our client database is ever provided
    to any third-party without prior authorization by the client.
