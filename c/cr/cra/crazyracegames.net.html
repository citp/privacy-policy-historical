							<!-- ATOSPP version: 1.6, my_privacy_policy --><h2 id="atospp-privacy" class="auto-tos-pp ppheading">Privacy Policy:</h2><p>CrazyraceGames.Net ("<strong>CrazyraceGames.Net</strong>") operates CrazyraceGames.Net and may operate other websites. It is CrazyraceGames.Net policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, CrazyraceGames.Net collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. CrazyraceGames.Net purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how CrazyraceGames.Net visitors use its website. From time to time, CrazyraceGames.Net may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>CrazyraceGames.Net also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on CrazyraceGames.Net blogs/sites. CrazyraceGames.Net only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to CrazyraceGames.Net websites choose to interact with CrazyraceGames.Net in ways that require CrazyraceGames.Net to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that CrazyraceGames.Net gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up  at <a href="http://CrazyraceGames.Net">CrazyraceGames.Net</a> to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with CrazyraceGames.Net are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, CrazyraceGames.Net collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with CrazyraceGames.Net. CrazyraceGames.Net does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>CrazyraceGames.Net discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on CrazyraceGames.Net behalf or to provide services available at CrazyraceGames.Net websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
