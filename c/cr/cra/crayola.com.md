**How We Collect and Use Your Information**

Many of the ways in which you interact with our site allow us to learn more about you. We collect and store statistics and other information about the online activities of our visitors on an aggregated (collective) basis. We use your IP address, which is assigned to your computer by your [ISP](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415143235id_/http%3A//www.crayola.com/registration/glossary_of_terms.cfm), to help diagnose problems with our [server](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415143235id_/http%3A//www.crayola.com/registration/glossary_of_terms.cfm) and to administer our Web site. Your IP address, HTTP protocol elements, and computer information are used to gather broad demographic information. We use [cookies](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415143235id_/http%3A//www.crayola.com/registration/glossary_of_terms.cfm) to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your Registration ID so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other purposes. We also track the number of people who view each page to learn which features are the most popular. But in these, and almost all other instances, we do not obtain personally identifiable information about you. 

In those instances where we do collect personally identifiable information, it is only to improve your experience on our site. Examples of voluntarily submitting personally identifiable information include our polls, entering sweepstakes or contests, filling out the registration page, submitting a search, sending us feedback or posting in our [chat rooms](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415143235id_/http%3A//www.crayola.com/registration/glossary_of_terms.cfm) or [message boards](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415143235id_/http%3A//www.crayola.com/registration/glossary_of_terms.cfm).

The more accurate this information is, the better we are able to customize your experience. Our site's registration form requires users to give us online contact information like your name and E-mail address. This is for personalization purposes as well as a unique identifier that allows us to contact you if you receive our newsletter or to tell you that you have won one of the sweepstakes offers available to registered users. Additional demographic and preference information (like birthday, profession, children in household, or reason for using Crayola.com) is to help us customize your experience and develop new features that are most relevant to our users. We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners if the customer selects to receive such information. Your contact information is only used with your permission to provide you with information about us and is never shared with other companies who may want to contact our visitors unless specific permission to share information is given. We require that any third parties with whom we share your information maintain this data in a confidential manner. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

We may share personal customer information with our agents, representatives and trusted service providers for the purpose of assisting us in delivering our website content, sending email about your Crayola.com registration or other information you have elected to receive, fulfilling customer orders; administering contests or sweepstakes, providing customer service; enhancing and improving customers' shopping experiences; and completing credit card transactions. These third parties are not allowed to use this information for any purpose except providing these services on behalf of Crayola.com. We may also share personal customer information with law enforcement officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities related to the use of our site. We will have no legal liability for such disclosures. 

Demographic and profile data may be used for marketing and targeting purposes. Tracking how users interact with our site helps us to develop new features and content. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers only on an aggregate basis, that is, never containing any personally identifiable information. 

Our online surveys and contests ask users for contact information (like their email address). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. The user's contact information is only used to contact the user when necessary. However, on particular pages where we ask for your personally identifiable information, we may explicitly tell you that the data we are collecting on that page will be shared with third parties, in which case those disclosures shall override anything to the contrary in this policy. For example, before you submit answers to questions we ask in an advertiser-sponsored promotion, we will tell you that your answers will be shared with that advertiser. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

We display advertising on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads may collect anonymous preference and interest visitor information. This information is used to create anonymous interest profiles. This information does not include and is never merged with personally identifiable information (such as name, address or email address) or any information that is considered sensitive or controversial or that would compromise your privacy. These profiles are used to tailor site content, promotions and advertising and to perform market research. 

In the event of a complaint, we may also receive personally identifiable information about you from other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation to that complaint. 

**Children's Guidelines**

Children's privacy is of primary concern to us. 

1\. WE DO NOT collect online contact information without parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to suspend participation in the activity. Without prior parental notification, online information will only be used to respond directly to the child's request and will not be used for other purposes. 

2\. WE DO NOT collect personally identifiable offline contact information from children.

3\. WE DO NOT distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information from children.

4\. WE DO NOT give the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent.

5\. WE DO NOT require a child to provide us with more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation.

**Cookies and Other Tracking Methods**

[Cookies](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415143235id_/http%3A//www.crayola.com/registration/glossary_of_terms.cfm) are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our site. We use cookies or, in a limited number of cases, [ISP](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415143235id_/http%3A//www.crayola.com/registration/glossary_of_terms.cfm) addresses for a number of reasons. First, cookies allow you to store your password without having to constantly re-enter it. Second, cookies can also help us to tailor a Web site or a marketing message to better match your needs and interests. Third, cookies allow us to better understand how users use our site, which in turn helps us focus our resources on features that are most popular with our users. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly if you do. Cookies that contain an identifier uniquely linked to you may relate to the information described above. 

**Public Forums**

This site may have [chat rooms](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415143235id_/http%3A//www.crayola.com/registration/glossary_of_terms.cfm), [forums](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415143235id_/http%3A//www.crayola.com/registration/glossary_of_terms.cfm), and / or [message boards](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415143235id_/http%3A//www.crayola.com/registration/glossary_of_terms.cfm) available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

**Security**

Crayola makes every effort to ensure the security of your personal information, and the secure transmission of your information from your PC to our [servers](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415143235id_/http%3A//www.crayola.com/registration/glossary_of_terms.cfm). There are security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. This site uses [SSL](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415143235id_/http%3A//www.crayola.com/registration/glossary_of_terms.cfm) (secure server software) that [encrypts](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415143235id_/http%3A//www.crayola.com/registration/glossary_of_terms.cfm) all the personally identifiable information passing back and forth between your PC and our server during registration and online purchase. 

We understand that you might be concerned about buying online. That is why your security at our site is as important to us as it is to you, our customer. We use some of the best technology available to ensure that your payment information is processed confidentially and accurately. We use the VeriSign system and technology, which we believe makes shopping at TheCrayolaStore.Com just as safe as your neighborhood store. VeriSign features the industry standard [SSL](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415143235id_/http%3A//www.crayola.com/registration/glossary_of_terms.cfm) (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology, which scrambles your credit card number and your other personal information to prevent the viewing of that data by anyone other than The CrayolaStore.Com. TheCrayolaStore.Com also strives to maintain the security of information stored on our servers to protect against unauthorized access to your personal information. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. We recommend that you never reveal your registration ID to anyone. You will never receive a request from Crayola.com for your registration information in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. The privacy policy described here applies only to Crayola.com, and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites to which we [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415143235id_/http%3A//www.crayola.com/registration/glossary_of_terms.cfm), or which link to us. Also, while Crayola hopes to provide a safe and secure online experience, be very careful about sharing your personal information with other people you might meet as a result of your visit to Crayola.com. 

**Choice/Opt-Out**

Our site requires you to opt-in to receiving any information from us or our partners. We also provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving any future communications from us and our partners at any time.
