##### What This Privacy Policy Covers

This policy covers how Crably IVS ("Crably," "we," "us," or "our") treats personal information that it collects and receives on http://crably.com. We are not in the business of selling information about you: we use information shared with us for the sole purpose of running and improving our services. This notice tells you what information we collect, steps we take to protect and secure it, how we use and share information, and finally, how you can contact us with questions or concerns. 

##### Information We Gather

Crably collects personal information when you register with us, use Crably products or services or post content on a Crably website or blog. This information is limited to your email address, username, and any information you post on your site. Your password is stored securely. 

Crably may also collect personal information if you enter into promotions. 

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. IP addresses, browser and session information may be used to: 

  * __Diagnose and prevent service or technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.
  * __Estimate the total number of users visiting Crably's web sites from specific geographical regions.
  * __Help determine which users have access privileges to certain content, services or resources that we offer.
  * __Monitor and prevent fraud and abuse.



We also collect other user information as part of our internal analytics services, in order to improve the services. 

If you sign up for a paid service the billing information, which may include your name, address, telephone number, credit card details, and other information that is necessary in order to process the transaction will be collected and processed by a third party Payment Gateway (like Paypal, Stripe, Paymill, etc ). Under no circumstance do we store any of your sensitive billing details. 

Crably uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, identification and authentication, services improvement, support, contact, research, and anonymous reporting. 

##### Billing information

Should you sign up for a Crably paid account, register a domain through us, or purchase another premium service, we require your billing information in order to process the transaction.  
We will retain the last 4 digits of your credit card number, credit card type, name, address, and some other billing information, so that you may identify that card used in the future. We do not store your credit card number or CVV2; this information is discarded after your transaction has been processed.  
If your subscription is auto-renewing, a third party Payment Gateway (like Paypal, Stripe, Paymill, etc ) will store your credit card information on their secure payment gateway for as long as necessary to carry out the terms of your subscription.  
All transactions are processed over an industry standard SSL/TLS connection, with a minimum of 128-bit encryption.

These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
