When corresponding with you via HTML capable email, Web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our email.

**Managing cookies and Web beacons.** By accepting this Privacy Policy, you specifically agree to our use of cookies and Web beacons as described herein.

## 6\. SECURITY

We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to safeguard the information we collect online at the Sites.
