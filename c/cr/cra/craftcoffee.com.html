<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p>Craft Coffee may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the Craft Coffee Terms of Use. Craft Coffee may disclose personally identifiable information to parties in compliance with Craft Coffee's Copyright and Intellectual Property Policy, as Craft Coffee in Craft Coffee's sole discretion believes necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. In such events, Craft Coffee may disclose name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email address and company name. Craft Coffee may share aggregated demographic information with business partners.</p>
<p>Craft Coffee is affiliated with a variety of businesses and works closely with them. These businesses may operate stores on the Craft Coffee website or sell items to you from the Craft Coffee website. Craft Coffee may also provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. Due to the nature of Craft Coffee's business model, when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, you will share customer information that is related to such transaction with that affiliated business.</p>
<p>Craft Coffee employs other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and needs to share your information with them to provide products and services to you. Examples could include but are not limited to fulfilling orders, handling billing disputes, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service.</p>
<p>Craft Coffee will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with nonaffiliated parties except as specified in this Privacy Policy to provide products or services you have requested or when Craft Coffee has your permission. It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Craft Coffee's Terms of Use, as specified in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by law. In some cases, Craft Coffee may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Craft Coffee will transfer information about you if Craft Coffee is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Craft Coffee will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Craft Coffee web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p>As part of the buying and selling process, you may obtain another Craft Coffee user's email address, shipping address and/or other information. Pursuant to Craft Coffee's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use this information. This information should be used for only Craft Coffee-related communications or for Craft Coffee-facilitated transactions. Craft Coffee has not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages. Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent from the user, you are not licensed to add any Craft Coffee user to your email or physical mail list.</p>
<h2>Third Parties</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information Craft Coffee collects from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are buyers or sellers on Craft Coffee or throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Craft Coffee does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. Craft Coffee is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other websites on the Internet, even those linked to or from the Craft Coffee site. Craft Coffee encourages you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</p>
<h2>Editing and Deleting Account Information</h2>
<p>You can change your Craft Coffee Account Information at any time. Craft Coffee may send you certain communications relating to the Craft Coffee service, such as service announcements and administrative messages that are considered part of your Craft Coffee account. You can delete your Craft Coffee account by emailing help@craftcoffee.com. Please note that your identification, billing and contact information may remain in Craft Coffee's records for some period.</p>
<p>Craft Coffee limits access to personal information about you to employees who Craft Coffee believes reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. Your Craft Coffee Account Information is password-protected.</p>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes you may correct or update it by making the change on your Craft Coffee account page. You may delete or deactivate your account by emailing Customer Support at help@craftcoffee.com. Craft Coffee will respond to your request within 10-20 business days.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. Your Craft Coffee account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) for registration Craft Coffee encrypts that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Craft Coffee follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once Craft Coffee receives it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while Craft Coffee strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, Craft Coffee cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on Craft Coffee's Web site, you can email Craft Coffee at help@craftcoffee.com.</p>
<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>If this privacy policy is changed, Craft Coffee will post changes so that you are aware of those changes. Craft Coffee reserves the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If Craft Coffee makes material changes to this policy you will be notified here, by email, or other places Craft Coffee deems appropriate.</p>
