#### The Information We Collect and Use

When we use the term " **Personal Information** " we mean information that reasonably can be used to identify you as an individual person. We collect Personal Information through your use of our Sites. Personal Information is referred to as Personal Data in some countries. We collect and use three categories of information and discuss each in turn below.

  1. **Personal Information You Provide To Us**

We collect personal information when you choose to share that information with us in the following ways. 

    * On Sites where you can register for an account or if you sign up for our Gymboree Rewards program through our Sites, we collect registration and demographic details (for example, name, username, password, address, phone number, and email address), which we use to administer the account and communicate with you.
    * When you sign up for our newsletter, we collect your contact information and communication preferences, which we use to manage how we communicate with you.
    * When you make purchases through our Sites, we collect payment information and related shipping and transaction details, which we use to fulfill orders, complete your transaction and deliver products to you as may be ordered.
    * When you take surveys and enter challenges, promotions, contests and sweepstakes, we collect contact, demographic and eligibility information, which we use to confirm eligibility, administer the programs and communicate with you about awards.
    * When you submit identifiable comments or other content on the Sites, we collect whatever information you supply and use this information to communicate with you if requested, and otherwise fulfill the purpose of the content submission. Please be aware that any stories, photos or comments that you submit on a public forum will become publicly accessible.
    * When you send gift certificates or refer a friend to our Sites, we will collect the name and contact information of the recipient in order to fulfill your request.
    * If you submit a job application with Gymboree online, we will collect information including your contact details, work history, employment needs and interests, and anything relevant to the job for which you are applying.
  2. **Information Collected Automatically**

We use various data collection technologies to collect other types of data that do not directly reveal your identity (" **Other Information** "). If we associate Other Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Logging Functionality:** As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and/or clickstream data. We generally only use this data for purposes such as security, fraud detection, and protecting our rights.

**Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies:** We and our subsidiaries, business partners, and service providers use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to manage our websites and email messages and to collect and track information about you and your activities online over time and across different websites. These technologies help us to recognize you, customize or personalize your shopping experience, store items in your online shopping cart between visits, and analyze the use of our Sites to make them more useful to you. These technologies also allow us to, and allow us to allow our service providers to, aggregate demographic and statistical data and compilations of information, which may or may not include Personal Information, and provide this information to our service providers.

Most Internet browsers allow you to remove or manage cookie functions and adjust your privacy and security preferences. For information on how to do this, access the "help" menu on your Internet browser, or visit <http://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-control-cookies/>. Please note, however, that disabling our cookies may result in your inability to take full advantage of all of the features of our Sites.

**Analytics:** We use analytics providers such as Google Analytics to help us evaluate and measure the use and performance of our Sites. To opt-out of the aggregation and analysis of data collected about you on our Sites by Google Analytics, visit <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout> and download and install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.

  3.  **Information We Obtain from Third Party Sources**
We collect Personal Information from a number of third party sources.  
**Supplemental Information:** We may receive additional Personal Information from third party sources that we may append to existing consumer information, such as email and address verification and interest data. We use this supplemental information to better understand our consumers, deliver relevant offers and advertising, and improve our operations, Sites and our advertising and marketing campaigns.

**Affiliate Program:** The Gymboree Affiliate Program enables third parties to refer customers to our Sites in exchange for a commission. When you are referred to our site through our Affiliate Partners we will receive information about you, including Other Information in order to match your purchases to the Affiliate Partner’s referral. We collect, use and share this information to administer the Affiliate Program and to process transactions.

**Third Party Sharing Tools:** We may provide functionality on the Sites that will allow you to share content or access third party sharing tools such as widgets, tools or buttons. If you choose to use these sharing functions, we will use your Personal Information and the information you  provide to share content only. As with all links to non-Gymboree Sites, content and services, we recommend that you read the privacy policies and terms associated with third parties carefully.

It may also be disclosed in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership.

#### Your Online Choices

We support the self-regulatory principles of the Digital Advertising Alliance (" **DAA** "). We work with a variety of advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, and analytics companies (" **Ad Partners** ") that use different technologies to collect data about your use of the Sites (such as pages visited, ads viewed or clicked on) in order to deliver relevant advertising.

These technologies may include the placement on our Sites of cookies or web beacons, and other data collection technologies by these Ad Partners to track how our Sites are being used, to track where users go and what they do after their leave our Sites, and to link various devices you may use, and to serve you more relevant ads. These advertisements may appear on our Sites or other services that you visit.

For more information about how Ad Partners use the information collected by the technologies on our Sites and about your options not to accept cookies placed by some of these companies on our Sites, please visit the [DAA’s opt-out page](http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/). You may also opt out of additional third party advertising networks by going to the Network Advertising Initiative’s [website](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/) and following the directions. If you are accessing the Site from the European Union, please visit the [EDAA’s opt-out page](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) and if you are accessing the Site from Canada, please visit the [DAAC’s opt-out page](http://youradchoices.ca/choices/).

The opt-outs described above are device- and browser-specific and may not work on all devices. If you choose to opt-out through any of these opt-out tools, this does not mean you will cease to see advertising. Rather, the ads you see will just not be based on your interests. In addition, when you opt out using one of these methods, our Ad Partners will continue to collect information for any other purpose permitted by the DAA’s rules. Since these opt-outs are cookie-based, if you clear your cookies at any time, you will need to opt out again through the links above.

Please note that this Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of our Ad Partners. Gymboree does not have control over these third party technologies or the information contained in them.
