	<h3>
		Welcome to the Crackle online service (the "Service") operated by Crackle, Inc. ("Crackle"). Your privacy is important 
		to us and we have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect, use, and share your personal information. 
		Because the Service is global, information about you that we collect or that you submit may be transferred to, processed 
		in, and held in countries (including the United States) other than the one in which you reside. By using the Service, you 
		explicitly consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Please read 
		this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to <a href="/support/feedback.aspx">contact us</a>.  
		When you use the Service, you also consent to our <a href="/tos/">Terms of Service</a>.
	</h3>
	<div style="margin: 20px 50px 0px 50px">
	<h4>Opting Out Of Future Communications; Updating And Deleting Your Information</h4>
	<p>
		We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you have questions or concerns regarding 
		this Privacy Policy, please feel free to <a href="/support/feedback.aspx">contact us</a>.  If you wish to exclude your personal 
		information from our direct marketing purposes or would like to update or delete your e-mail address or other 
		personal information that you previously submitted to us, you may do so by editing your Profile page by following 
		the process described <a href="/support/faq/#change_email">here</a>.
	</p>
	<h4>Information We Automatically Collect</h4>
	<p>We automatically collect certain non-personal information to help us understand how our 
	users use the Service (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "Usage Data"). For example, 
	each time you use the Service we may collect your IP address and other information about your Internet connectivity. 
	In addition, we use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique user. 
	We use cookies to improve the quality of our Service and make the Service easier to use. We do this by storing 
	information (for example, settings preferences) about a particular user session in cookies in order to provide you 
	with a seamless experience during a particular session. Certain of our Service Providers (defined below) may use 
	cookies in connection with the services they perform on our behalf. If you choose to do so, you can configure your 
	browser to delete existing cookies or disable cookies altogether. However, certain features of the Service may not 
	work if you delete or disable cookies.</p>
	<p>We may contract with companies or persons to provide certain services including data management, 
	promotional and advertising services, etc. ("Service Providers"). We provide our Service Providers with the information 
	needed for them to perform these services. We also ask our Service Providers to abide by our privacy policy with respect 
	to Usage Data or other data we share with them. Certain Service Providers of advertising services may use Usage Data 
	(together with any non-personal information they collect directly from you via cookies and any information that you 
	submit directly to them) to (a) improve, enhance and implement the sale, display and targeting of advertising on the 
	Service and (b) combine such Usage Data with user data from their other customers to compile aggregate statistics, 
	metrics and general trend data that do not identify you or your Usage Data for marketing and promotional purposes only. 
	You can opt-out of the collection of data by certain advertising Service Providers at the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">
	Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out page</a>.</p>

	<h4>Information You Choose To Submit</h4>
	<p>
		When you register to become a member of the Service, we collect your user name, email address, 
		gender, date of birth, and whatever other personal information you choose to provide, including, 
		without limitation, any personal information that you provide to us in connection with any contests, 
		sweepstakes, and/or other promotion (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as 
		"Personal Information"). We use your Personal Information to notify you of new product releases, 
		to send service notifications, to customize the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your 
		requests for products and services, to improve our services, to conduct research, and to solicit 
		your feedback and input about the Service. In addition, if you have opted into receiving newsletters 
		or other communications from us, we use your Personal Information for that purpose. For contests, 
		sweepstakes and other promotions conducted on or through the Service, we use the Personal Information
		that you provide to communicate with you regarding such contest, sweepstakes or other promotion and you 
		are deemed to consent to us sharing such Personal Information with our contest, sweepstakes or promotional 
		partners for the purpose of administering awards. When you send messages through the Service, your user 
		name will be identified in the message. Other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, except for 
		aggregate demographic information that we may share with third parties in a manner that does not link 
		such information to any individual, we will not share your Personal Information with third parties unless 
		you have given us permission to do so.  
	</p>
	<h4>Your Profile, Media, and Friends</h4>
	<p>
		We reserve the right to make all of the following information about you available to all other users of 
		the Service: (a) any information you choose to include in your Service profile (including, without limitation, 
		your user name, age, gender, favorite links, where you live and other personal details you choose to share); 
		(b) any videos or other personal media content you submit to us; (c) your Crackle user name and friends; and 
		(d) the date you registered to become a member of, and last logged into, the Service.  
	</p>
	<h4>Other Authorized Disclosures</h4>
	<p>
		Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, you understand and agree that Crackle may 
		access, preserve, and disclose any information we have collected about you or that you have submitted: (1) 
		in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal 
		rights or defend against legal claims; (2) to protect the rights and property of Crackle, its affiliates, 
		or the public; (3) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding 
		illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person; (4) to our 
		parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with Crackle (in which 
		case we will require such entities to honor this Privacy Policy); and (5) if Crackle is acquired by or merged 
		with another entity (in which case we will require such entity to assume our obligations under this Privacy 
		Policy). In addition, Crackle may forward any counter notification that you submit pursuant to Crackle's 
		Terms of Service, and any related communications, to third parties. 	
	</p>
	<h4>Public Areas</h4>
	<p>
		Your use of areas of the Service that are intended for interaction with other users may reveal your user name 
		and may allow you to publish certain personal information about you. By choosing to use these areas, you 
		understand and agree that anyone with access to those areas may access and forward any information about you 
		that is contained in or that you post to those areas. As with any social networking service, you should use 
		care when disclosing your personal information to strangers. 	
	</p>
	<h4>Controlling Your Personal Information</h4>
	<p>
		The Service provides tools for you to control your profile and other personal information. You can edit your 
		profile and other information at any time through the Crackle Web site. At any time, you can terminate your 
		account which will remove your profile and other personal information from view.  
	</p>
	<h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
	<p>
		The Service may contain links to Web sites operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no 
		control. Privacy policies on such linked Web sites may be different from our Privacy Policy. You access 
		such linked Web sites at your own risk.
	</p>
	<h4>Security</h4>
	<p>
		We use industry standard security measures to protect your information so that it is not made available to 
		unauthorized parties. We also require our Service Providers to implement and maintain reasonable security 
		procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information we share with them. No data transmission 
		over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect personal 
		information, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or 
		from the Service, and you do so at your own risk. If you have any questions regarding which measures and 
		techniques we use, feel free to <a href="/support/feedback.aspx">contact us</a>. 
	</p>
	<h4>Changes</h4>
	<p>
		From time to time, Crackle may change this Privacy Policy. Crackle will post notice
		of any such change on the Crackle Web site located at http://crackle.com/ (the "Site").
		You should visit the Site periodically to review any such changes because continued
		use of the Service following such notice shall indicate your acknowledgment and
		acceptance thereof. However, if we make any change that allows us to use your Personal
		Information in any materially different manner than we were permitted under the
		Privacy Policy in effect at the time you submitted such Personal Information, we
		will obtain your consent before making such materially different use.
	</p>
	<h4>Children's Privacy Statement</h4>
	<p>
		We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If we become 
		aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of 13, 
		we will delete such information from our records. Because we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable 
		information from children under the age of 13, we also do not knowingly distribute such information to third parties.
	</p>
	<h4>Changes</h4>
	<p>
		From time to time, Crackle may change this Privacy Policy. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, in whole or 
		in part, we will inform you by posting the changed Privacy Policy on the Service. Those changes will go into effect 
		on the date posted in the notice. The new policy will apply to all current and past users of the Service and will 
		replace any prior policies that are inconsistent. 
	</p>
	<h4>Additional Questions</h4>
	<p>
		Again, feel free to contact us any time if you have further questions about the Service.
