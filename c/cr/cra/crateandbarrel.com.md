# Privacy Policy | Crate and Barrel

By sharing the Privacy Policy for Crate and Barrel and CB2 (collectively, “we” or “us”), we hope to help you understand how information can create new opportunities for you, our customer, as well as to reassure you that we respect and honor customer requests to restrict and protect personal information.

## Information We Collect

### Information you provide to us:

#### When you use our services:

When you make a purchase in one of our stores or on crateandbarrel.com, cb2.com, or our mobile apps (collectively, “Websites”) or otherwise, create an account, join our Gift Registry, participate in a sweepstakes or contest or any other promotion, post a product review, engage with us on our various social media platforms, apply for our credit card, participate in one of our surveys, send us any feedback, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, or interact with us in any way, you provide us with personal information, such as: your name, email address, mailing address, ZIP code, phone number and credit card numbers. This allows us to provide you with our services, to process your transactions more efficiently and, ultimately, to give you a higher caliber of customer service. If you choose not to provide the requested information we may not be able to provide you with the services, or certain features of those services may not be functional.

#### When you apply for a job:

Our Website includes a Careers feature that allows you to submit an online job application, if you reside in the US or in Canada. When you submit an online application, you will be required to provide personal information, including but not limited to your name, contact information, job interests, educational and job history, and references. This information will be used by us to assess and process your application.

You will also be asked to provide equal opportunities information. This is not mandatory – if you don’t provide it, it won’t affect your application. We won’t make the information available to any staff outside our recruitment team, including hiring managers, in a way that can identify you. Any information you provide will be used to produce and monitor equal opportunities statistics.

The online application process is hosted and supported by a third-party service provider, iCIMS. iCIMS receives and stores the information you provide. iCIMS does not disclose the personal information it receives and maintains for us to anyone else. [Click [here](https://www.icims.com/legal/privacy-policy) to see the icims privacy policy]

If we decide to interview you, we may print your application and use it during the interview process. If you are hired, your application becomes part of your employee file. If you are not immediately hired, your printed application is kept for two years and then typically will be destroyed. We may ask you to provide additional information during the interview or hiring process. We may also use the information you provide to contact you about your application; for example, to ask you to agree to a background check or to send you an offer letter.

We do not share the information you provide in the online application to anyone outside of Crate and Barrel/CB2 and iCIMS, except as we believe is required by law.

#### Information about you we receive from third parties:

Other companies we do business with may forward to us additional personal information (such as, for example, names, mailing addresses and email addresses, as well as demographic and other usage information), when we have news or product offerings that may be of interest to those individuals.This does not apply to you if you reside in the EU.

  * **Prevent fraud and abuse of the services:** We review transactions internally on a regular basis to identify potential concerns, and we partner with select outside companies to further enhance our ability to ensure that fraudulent orders and/or potentially damaging worms, viruses and other types of malware do not interfere with our ability to provide the best possible products, value and services to you and to our other valued customers.
  * **Protect your rights:** We will share information in an emergency or to protect the safety of any person and if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the rights, property, or personal safety of any person.
  * **Protect our rights and comply with our legal obligations:** We cooperate with government and law-enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.

When contacting us, please clearly state your request, including your name, mailing address, email address and phone number. After we process your request, your personal information will no longer be shared for marketing purposes. Opting out of sharing your information for marketing purposes will not prevent your relevant information from being provided to our Service Providers such as shippers when you order products for delivery or from other sharing for non-marketing purposes. Similarly, this will not prevent us from sharing information as and to the extent it is combined or aggregated (in a non-personally identified manner) or otherwise analyzed by us or our Service Providers.

If you choose to opt out, we will place an "opt-out cookie" on your computer. The "opt-out cookie" is browser specific and device specific and only lasts until cookies are cleared from your browser or device. The opt-out cookie will not work for some cookies that are important to how our websites and mobile apps work ("essential cookies"). If the cookie is removed or deleted, if you upgrade your browser or if you visit us from a different computer, you will need to return to the links above to re-select your preferences.

**Mobile app communications:** You can deactivate push notifications in our mobile apps at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.

Please note that, to provide you with more control of your experience with us, opting out of one brand does not automatically opt you out of our other brands. For example, if you click through to opt out of emails from CB2, you will not be opted out of emails from Crate and Barrel.

**Catalog:** To request to have your name removed from the catalog mailing list, please complete [this catalog opt-out form](https://web.archive.org/customer-service/catalog-preference). We appreciate your patience while we process your request. When you make subsequent purchases at Crate and Barrel or CB2, you may provide contact information for customer service only, and request that your name not be forwarded to either mailing list. If you have already opted out, you do not need to opt out again; your information will not be used for purposes other than the customer service you have requested, unless you affirmatively ask to opt in again, in which case you will be opted in and will receive emails from us until you again request to be opted out again.

**Email tracking:** To opt out of our use of cookies to track your interaction with our email communications, you can click the "unsubscribe" link found in each email you receive or remove yourself from the relevant mailing list or lists as described here.

**Website Analytics:** You can opt out of our Website analysis tool by clicking [here](http://metric.crateandbarrel.com/optout.html). See above for information on opting out of Google and Adobe Analytics.

## Dispute resolution, Arbitration Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights

We are committed to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. Please direct your inquiries or complaints to privacy@crateandbarrel.com.

Notwithstanding the below, if you reside in the EU, in the event your concerns in connection with how we process your information are not addressed you can file a complaint with the data protection supervisory authority in the country of your residence.

You and we agree that we will resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. You and we hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim. All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and us relating to this Privacy Policy or the Websites (each a "Claim") shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA Rules"). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.

If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.

This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or us from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and we also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and we retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with this Privacy Policy, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in this Privacy Policy.

Neither you nor we may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or our individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.

If any provision of this Section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of this Section of the Privacy Policy will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Privacy Policy. This Section of the Privacy Policy will survive the termination of your relationship with us.

THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
