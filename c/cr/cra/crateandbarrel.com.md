# Crate and Barrel: Assistance

Last Updated: October 21st, 2002 

The front door to your home. Open, it invites and welcomes friends and family. Closed, it provides important privacy and security. 

Information is a "door" which we should just as thoughtfully consider before opening or closing. By sharing our Privacy Policy, we hope to help you understand how information can create new opportunities for our customers, as well as to reassure you that we respect and honor customer requests to restrict and protect personal information. 

Our perspective has always been and continues to be about enhancing our customers' experience before and after purchase … in store, online, and ultimately at home. Behind your front door.

**Getting to Know You**  
When you make a purchase in one of our stores, join our gift registry, or answer one of our surveys, you may choose to give Crate and Barrel basic information: name, email address, mailing address, ZIP code, phone, and credit card numbers. This allows us to process your transactions more efficiently, and ultimately, to give you a higher caliber of customer service. When you visit our Web site, we may collect more information: your Internet service provider's address, the name of the Web page directing you, as well as your clicks and activity on our site. This tracking data helps us understand how to make our site more available and user friendly to our customers. 

**Getting To Know What You Like**  
We also gather customer information by taking note of the purchases you make online, in our stores, and from our catalogues. Think of it as a concierge service where customer preferences are remembered for future consideration. By looking at your purchases in context with marketing demographics or with information from companies whose products and services you may be interested in, it helps our buyers and merchandisers continue to seek out products and designs you may find relevant and unique. Likewise, other companies may also forward to us additional names, mailing addresses, and email addresses when we have news or product offerings that may be of special interest to their customers. 

**Information At Your Service**  
The personal information we collect is primarily intended to offer better customer service and to improve communications. When a purchased item is not immediately available, many of our customers appreciate receiving an email to update the status of their order. We also may need to contact customers by phone, postal mail, or email if questions arise regarding their order. 

When you shop at a Crate and Barrel store, order from our catalogues, or visit us online, it is also an opportunity for you to provide us with information and feedback that helps us continue to bring new ideas, unique products, and a creative approach to shopping for your home. 

**Information Secure Under Lock And Key**  
Our customers are protected at all times against the loss, misuse, and alteration of information. We use encryption technology whenever receiving and transferring your personal information on our site. 

When you make a purchase online, either a solid key or a locked padlock icon will appear in the lower right of your browser window. This icon insures that your transaction session is secured through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If one of these icons does not appear, please contact Crate and Barrel at 800-967-6696 to complete your purchase. 

  


**Update Your Information**  
Updating your contact information is quick and easy. Just [contact us](https://web.archive.org/assistance/contactUs.asp), including your previous and current full name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. Please understand updates may take from six to eight weeks to process from the date of request receipt. 

**Information Sharing**  
Information sharing can provide a valuable type of consumer networking. By helping to make new connections and introduce new resources to our customers, you may discover new opportunities and products compatible with your interests and needs. With that end in mind, Crate and Barrel and its affiliate companies share information with each other. In addition, when you purchase an item from one of our catalogues your customer information is shared with other selected companies whose products and services you may find useful. 

**Information Sharing Is Up To You**  
We appreciate and respect that not all customers may wish to benefit from the opportunity to share information with our affiliate companies or select companies. If you do not want Crate and Barrel to share your customer information, please immediately [contact us](https://web.archive.org/assistance/contactUs.asp) and we will remove your name from lists we share with other companies. After the six to eight week time period it takes to process your request, your information will no longer be shared. When contacting us, please clearly state your request, including your name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. 

It is important to understand that with some companies or online partners, for example WeddingChannel.com, your information must be shared in order to receive their services. By agreeing to share information, our customers may have the opportunity to participate in a wider array of services and offerings. 

**Remove Your Name From Our Lists At Any Time**  
To delete your name from Crate and Barrel's email mailing list, [click here](https://web.archive.org/assistance/optOut.asp). To request to have your name removed from the catalogue mailing list, simply [contact us](https://web.archive.org/assistance/contactUs.asp). Please provide your full name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. We appreciate your patience as it may take up to six to eight weeks to process your request from the date of receipt. When you make subsequent purchases at Crate and Barrel, you may provide contact information for customer service only and request that your name not be forwarded to either mailing list. 

**Protecting Children's Privacy**  
Crate and Barrel adheres to a strict privacy code regarding children and does not knowingly accept personal information from any child. If it is brought to our attention that a subscriber is under age, we will immediately remove all personal and identifiable information from our records in compliance with the Online Children’s Privacy Protection Act of 1998. In addition, we will not disclose this information to any other companies. 

**Cookies Are Served**  
"Cookies" are small amounts of data that are stored on your computer. They find their way to your browser via a Web server. They sound friendly and helpful because they are. They flag information about your activity on our Web site. This information helps us improve our site and make it friendlier and easier to use. We never use cookies to save passwords, credit card numbers, or other highly confidential information. 

**Partnerships**  
We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. 

We contract with Double Click to help us assess visitation to our site and the effectiveness of our advertising. To do this, Double Click places small pixel tags and cookies on our site. While these do allow Double Click to track your visits, the data retrieved cannot be used for any reason without our authorization. To review their privacy policy, please go to [www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy). 

Many registry customers appreciate our partnership with WeddingChannel.com. Couples find it a convenient way for their guest to purchase from their bridal registry at Crate and Barrel and other companies.

**Links To Sites And Services**  
At times, we provide links our customers may be interested in. Crate and Barrel is not responsible for these sites. If you choose to explore these sites and services, we suggest that you carefully review their individual Privacy Policies. 

**A Privacy Promise**  
We support and adhere to the guidelines and practices adopted by the Direct Marketing Association's "Privacy Promise.” In so doing, we agree to comply with a customer's requests to not share their information with other companies or to contact them for marketing purposes by postal mail, telephone, or email. 

If at any time, as a customer, you feel Crate and Barrel is not committed to its Privacy Policy, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/assistance/contactUs.asp). You may also contact the DMA's Committee on Ethical Business Practices at [mgoldberger@the-dma.org](mailto:mgoldberger@the-dma.org). 

**Privacy Policy Updates**  
Efforts to bring new services, ideas, and partners to benefit our customers may make it necessary to amend our Privacy Policy. If this occurs, we will post the new policy on our Web site, in our stores, and in our catalogue. Once posted, the new policy will go into effect immediately, replacing any previously stated policy.
