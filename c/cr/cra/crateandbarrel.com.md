# Privacy Policy | Crate and Barrel

The front door to your home. Open, it invites and welcomes friends and family. Closed it provides privacy and security.

Information is a "door" which we should just as thoughtfully consider before opening or closing. By sharing our Privacy Policy, we hope to help you understand how information can create new opportunities for our customers, as well as to reassure you that we respect and honor customer requests to restrict and protect personal information.

Our perspective has always been and continues to be about enhancing our customers' experience before and after purchase…in store, online and ultimately, at home. Behind your front door.

## Getting to Know You

When you make a purchase in one of our Crate and Barrel stores, join our gift registry, or answer one of our surveys, you may choose to give us basic information: name, email address, mailing address, ZIP Code, phone, and credit card numbers. This allows us to process your transactions more efficiently, and ultimately, to give you a higher caliber of customer service. When you visit our Web site, we may collect more information: your Internet service provider's address, the name of the Web page directing you, as well as your clicks and activity on our site. This tracking data helps us understand how to make our site more available and user friendly to our customers.

## Getting to Know What You Like

We also gather customer information by taking note of the purchases you make. Think of it as a concierge service where customer preferences are remembered for future consideration. By looking at your purchases in context with marketing demographics or with information from companies whose products and services you may be interested in, it helps our buyers and merchandisers continue to seek out products and designs you may find relevant and unique. Likewise, other companies may also forward to us additional names, mailing addresses, and email addresses when we have news or product offerings that may be of special interest to their customers.

In order to serve you better, we may at times contract with other companies to help us process information. For instance, their assistance can help us better fulfill customer orders, manage and enhance customer data, and comply with postal regulations. For your security, these companies are bound by our non-disclosure agreements or contractual arrangements to provide privacy protection for your information.

## Information at Your Service

The personal information we collect is primarily intended to offer better customer service and to improve communications. The customer information from Euromarket Design's CB2 and Crate and Barrel brands is combined to provide greater security and inform customers of products and services that may interest them. When a purchased item is not immediately available, many of our customers appreciate receiving an email to update the status of their order. We also may need to contact customers by phone, postal mail, or email if questions arise regarding their orders.

When you shop at a Crate and Barrel store, order from our catalogs, or visit us online, it is also an opportunity for you to provide us with information and feedback that helps us continue to bring new ideas, unique products, and a creative approach to shopping for your home.

## Information Secure Under Lock And Key

We take all reasonable steps to protect our customers' personal information against loss, misuse, and alteration. We use encryption technology whenever receiving and transferring your personal information on our site.

When you make a purchase online, either a solid key or a locked padlock icon will appear in the lower right of your browser window. This icon indicates that your transaction session is secured through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If one of these icons does not appear, please contact Crate and Barrel at 800.967.6696 to complete your purchase.

## Update Your Information

Updating your contact information is quick and easy. Just [contact us](https://web.archive.org/Customer-Service/Contact-Us.aspx), including your previous and current full name, mailing address, email address and phone number. Please understand updates may take from six to eight weeks to process from the date of request receipt.

## Information Sharing

Information sharing can provide a valuable type of consumer networking. By helping to make new connections and introduce new resources to our customers, you may discover new opportunities and products compatible with your interests and needs. With that end in mind, when you purchase an item, your customer information is shared with other select companies whose products and services you may find useful.

Information sharing also helps us to guard against potential fraud and other wrongdoing. We review transactions internally on a regular basis to identify potential concerns, and we partner with select outside companies to further enhance our ability to ensure that fraudulent orders and/or potentially damaging worms, viruses and other types of malware do not interfere with our ability to provide the best possible products, value and services to you and to our other valued customers.

## Information Sharing Is Up to You

We appreciate and respect that not all customers may wish to benefit from the opportunity to share information with other select companies. If you do not want Crate and Barrel to share your customer information, please immediately contact us and we will remove your name from lists we share with other companies. After the six to eight week time period it takes to process your request, your information will no longer be shared. When contacting us, please clearly state your request, including your name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. Please note that this request will not prevent us from reviewing each transaction for potential wrongdoing, but it will be effective in all other instances.

It is important to understand that with some companies or online partners, for example WeddingChannel.com and our basic freight carrier AIT Worldwide Logistics, your information must be shared in order to receive their services.

For instance, when you order a large furniture item that requires Basic Freight Delivery, we send your name, address, email address and phone number to AIT, allowing you to access their online delivery scheduling system. AIT does not share your personal information with third parties; it is used strictly to coordinate and complete your shipment.

By agreeing to share information, our customers may have the opportunity to participate in a wider array of services and offerings.

## Partnerships

We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications.

We use CheetahMail to send emails that you have agreed to receive. Web cookies are used in those email messages and at our Web site to help us measure the effectiveness of those emails. You can "opt out" of this email cookie at any time by [deleting your name](https://web.archive.org/Customer-Service/Email-Preference.aspx) from the Crate and Barrel email mailing list.

We also contract with Omniture to help us assess visitation to our Crate and Barrel site. To do this, we place small pixel tags and cookies on our site. While these do allow Omniture to track your visits, the data retrieved cannot be used for any reason without our authorization. To review their privacy policy, please go to [www.omniture.com/en/privacy/policy](http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/policy).

We contract with third-party service providers to place our banner advertising on other websites. These providers may collect information from us about your visits to our website and stores, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use this information to tailor banner advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry-standard technology used by most major websites. Personally identifiable information may be shared with a third party advertising partner and its service providers, including your name, postal address and email address, as well as a record of any transactions you conduct on our website or offline in order to deliver banner advertisements and other advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain websites. Our trusted third party service provider will keep this data anonymous and will not share any personally identifiable information with any other third parties. Please visit the Network Advertising Initiative (<http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>) to learn more about the use of this information by our third-party advertising partner or to choose limited use of this information by opting out of interest-based online advertising.
