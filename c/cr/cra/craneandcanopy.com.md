**INTRODUCTION**  
Welcome to the Crane & Canopy website (the “Site”).  At Crane & Canopy we seek to provide you with a enjoyable shopping experience while maintaining your privacy.  The information that we may collect through the Site will allow us to enhance your shopping experience by catering to your personal preferences and providing effective customer service.  Please read this entire Privacy Policy which will inform you as to the types of information we gather, as well as how we will use and protect such information.  By visiting the Site you are agreeing the terms of our Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy, please do not access the Site.

In order to use the Site you may be required to complete a registration process in which we will collect certain personal information such as your name, address and email address.  When you register, you will also consent to receive email correspondence from us.  We will use your personal information to complete transactions, respond to your requests, deliver the products and services you request, and notify you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you.

In the event that you voluntarily submit additional, unsolicited personal information during the registration process or thereafter to Crane & Canopy, you expressly consent to Crane & Canopy’s collection and storage of such information.

If you wish to discontinue email correspondence at any time, simply follow the instructions to “Manage Your Subscription” which appear in every email we send, or contact us through the Contact Us page.  
If you chose to invite a friend to join Crane & Canopy you will need to provide us with his or her name and email address.  We will store this information to track the results of your invitations.

**COOKIES**  
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user returns.  Crane & Canopy uses cookies to help identify and track users, patterns of usage, and access preferences.  Crane & Canopy also uses temporary “session” cookies to make sure that you are remembered as you navigate through various pages of the Site.  If you do not want to have cookies placed on your computer you can set your browser to refuse cookies before using the Site, with the drawback that certain features of the Site may not function property without the aid of cookies.  
**  
SERVER STATISTICS**  
We collect general statistics to track user trends on our Site.  These statistics include hits to our server, the types of browsers used to access our Site, page views, and navigational patterns.  This type of information helps us track “where” our users are coming from so that we can target strong demographic areas and determine the most effective ways to communicate with our users. In connection with this analysis, Crane & Canopy also uses devices called “web beacons” to help us identify when emails sent to you have been received and read. We may also collect IP addresses and other information in order to prevent the introduction of viruses and hackers into the Site.  
**  
PROTECTION OF OUR INFORMATION**  
We use reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to help us protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of data stored on our system. The Site encrypts your credit card number and other personal information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology to provide for the secure transmission of the information from your PC to our servers. Except as specified in this Privacy Policy, we use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to your personal information to the employees, officers, third-party contractors, and strategic partners of Crane & Canopy who need the information in order to perform their duties.   While no system is 100% secure, we believe that the measures we have implemented minimize the risk of security breach to an appropriate level given the types of information involved.  
**  
HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION**  
Crane & Canopy will use your personal information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and provide you with information, products or services that we think may be of interest to you.  For example, we may share the personal information you provide to us as well as demographic information and purchase history we collect with strategic partners, such as suppliers, in order to select products that we believe may be of interest to you.  Within that framework, any of our employees, third-party contractors or strategic partners whom are given access to your personal information will be contractually obligated to keep such information confidential and to use the information only to provide the services we ask them to perform for you and for us.

Except as set forth above, Crane & Canopy does not rent or sell personal information to anyone, including third parties intending to use such information for direct marketing purposes.  We may provide aggregate statistics, which do not include personal information, about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related Site information to reputable third party vendors.  We may also disclose personal information we collect from you if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Crane & Canopy, third parties or the public at large.

INFORMATION POSTED TO BULLETIN BOARDS, CHAT ROOMS OR OTHER PUBLIC FORUMS**  
If you use a bulletin board, chat room or any other interactive or publicly accessible area of the Site, you should be aware that any personal information you submit there can be read, collected or used by any person for any purpose. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable or other information you choose to submit in these forums.  
**  
EXTERNAL LINKS**  
We may provide links to the websites of other companies through our Site.  We are not responsible for how these other companies collect, use, disclose, or secure the information that you provide them. If you choose to access a third party website linked to our Site, you do so at your own risk and subject to any terms of service or privacy policy (if any) associated with such third party websites.

You may access and update your personal information and your preferences to receive email or other communications through the My Account page.

Current members will not receive email invitations at any registered email address, but may receive invitations from friends at an email address that is not yet known to us.
