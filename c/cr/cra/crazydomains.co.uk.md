7.3. Deleting or Obtaining Copy of Information

You can contact us to request a copy of your personal information or delete your information by emailing our Information Security Officer at [privacy@crazydomains.com](mailto:privacy@crazydomains.com). The Privacy Officer shall attend to your request on a confidential basis within thirty (30) days of the request being received. Any request for deletion will only be undertaken to the extent that it is no longer necessary for any Services purchased or required for our legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual record keeping requirements worldwide.

Access of your personal information may be refused if:

  * Providing access would pose a serious and imminent threat to life or health of a person;
  * Providing access would create an unreasonable impact on the privacy of others;
  * The request is frivolous and vexatious; or
  * Denial of access is authorised or required by law.



7.4. Information Security, Storage, and Retention

We will endeavour to keep your personal information as secure as reasonably possible. Without limitation, registration information is not accessible over the Internet, but only from a secure password-protected internal workstation. Our Internet servers utilise a modern Linux-based operating system that is maintained with the latest available security patches and updates.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using Transport Layer Security (TLS), the successor to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

We follow the strict standards set out by the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standard to store and protect the personal data we collect, both during transmission and once we receive it. We also adhere to ISO 27001 in the adoption of a business wide Information Security Management System (ISMS) to ensure information security is at the forefront of all aspects of business operations. However, as no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at [privacy@crazydomains.com](mailto:privacy@crazydomains.com).

We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services you have requested and thereafter for a variety of legitimate, legal, or business purposes. These might include retention periods of up to six (6) years:

  * mandated by law, contract or similar obligations applicable to our global business operations;
  * for preserving, resolving, defending or enforcing our legal/contractual rights, and/or resolving disputes; or
  * needed to maintain adequate and accurate business and financial records.



If you have any questions about the security or retention of your personal data, you can contact our Information Security Officer at [privacy@crazydomains.com](mailto:privacy@crazydomains.com).

7.5 Information Quality

We will use all reasonable endeavours to ensure the accuracy and quality of the information collected about you. If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, or deactivate your account by making the change on your Account Profile page of the Account Manager or by emailing us at [customercare@crazydomains.com](mailto:customercare@crazydomains.com).

We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies from these companies on an individual or aggregated basis.

The third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects (Flash cookies) to store content information and preferences. To manage Flash cookies, please click here: <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html>

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We do link this automatically-collected data to personal information. IP addresses are tied to personal information for the purposes of logging site actions (updating information, buying products, etc.) so that in the event of a bug or a dispute, we can review the actions taken that led to the outcome and attempt to reproduce the issues.

Some browsers allow you to automatically notify websites you visit not to track you using a "Do Not Track" signal.

There is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you may wish to visit [www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).
