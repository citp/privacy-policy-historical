**Cookies**

Our website does not use "cookies." We do occasionally use what is called a "session cookie" but that cookie is removed as soon as you close your web browser window. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. You can generally set your browser to not accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. If you choose to NOT accept a cookie, you may not be able to view certain pages.

We use sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of your personal information that you share with us. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Once we receive your transmission, we will do our best to protect its security on our systems.
