# Crazy Egg | Privacy Policy

Last Updated: May 24, 2018

This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Crazy Egg, Inc. (“Crazy Egg”, “we”, “us”, “our”) on our websites located at the domains crazyegg.com, crazyeggvcr.com, and crazyeggproxy.com, as well as such other websites or mobile applications that we own or operate (individually and collectively, “Our Website” or the “Crazy Egg Website”) . 

## Scope of this Privacy Policy

As further discussed, below, data protection laws, regulations, and directives in certain jurisdictions distinguish between the rights and responsibilities of “Controller(s)” of personal information or data (“Information”), from those who are “Processor(s)” of such Information or data on the applicable controllers’ behalf. Crazy Egg is generally the controller of Information that it collects from and about the persons and entities who are visiting Our Website (“Crazy Egg Visitors”), and this Privacy Policy applies to Crazy Egg Visitors. 

We also provide certain services to commercial persons and entities (each, a “Client” and collectively, “Clients”), who, in turn, own and operate their own websites or mobile applications (“Client Site(s)”), and who wish to utilize our code, software and services and reports (the “Service(s)”) to analyze how third party visitors to their Client Sites (“Client Site Visitor(s)”) use, interact with, and engage their Client Sites. The applicable Clients are the Controllers of Information collected from their Client Site Visitors, whether or not such information is accessed, analyzed, or otherwise utilized by or on behalf of the Client via the Service (“Client Visitor Information”); Crazy Egg is not the Controller of such Client Visitor Information. This Privacy Policy applies to the use of Services by our Clients. However, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the Client Sites themselves, nor to any Client Visitor Information. For any questions regarding the privacy, security, or other practices or policies on the Client Sites, please contact the applicable Client. 

### Information Collected from Crazy Egg Visitors 

  * **Device Information from Crazy Egg Visitors.** We may receive and collect certain Information furnished by the visitor's browser or otherwise by their access device (“Device Information”), such as: 
    * Browser Information
    * Operating System Information
    * Mobile Device Information (e.g., device identifier, mobile operating system, etc.)
    * IP address (stored in anonymized form)
    * Page Accessed
    * Geographic Location
    * Time of visit (by day, week, and duration)
    * Whether the visitor is a new or return visitor
    * Other such Information as may be delivered or shared by the applicable browser or access software or device.
  * **Referral Information.** We may also receive certain information regarding visitors from the prior website visited by such visitors (“Referral Information”). For instance, If a Crazy Egg Visitor navigates to the Crazy Egg Website from another website, Crazy Egg may receive certain information from the referring website (i.e., the last website the visitor visited before visiting the Crazy Egg Website) as part of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ("HTTP") request. For example, if a Crazy Egg Visitor navigates to the Crazy Egg Website from a search engine, Crazy Egg may receive information contained in the referring URL for the applicable search query, such as the terms the Crazy Egg Visitor was searching for before visiting the Crazy Egg Website. 
  * **Registration Information from Crazy Egg Clients.** When Crazy Egg Visitors register as Clients to use the Crazy Egg Service, register to use a trial version of the Crazy Egg Service, or request additional information about Crazy Egg, Crazy Egg may require Information, such as name, e-mail mailing address, phone number, financial information (e.g., credit card number, billing address), and/or proposed Client Site to be tracked, to process the registration or request ("Client Registration Information"). 



### Crazy Egg’s Use of Crazy Egg Visitor Information

Crazy Egg may use Information of Crazy Egg Visitors, including Device Information Referral Information of Crazy Egg Visitors and Client Registration Information, to: 

  * authenticate Client’s access to the Crazy Egg Site, trial versions, or Service;
  * process and fulfill Client requests or purchases;
  * register Client accounts; 
  * check the Crazy Egg Visitor’s qualifications for registration and/or to bill Crazy Egg Clients for the Services. 



Crazy Egg may also use Client Information to: 

  * provide Crazy Egg's products and Services, personalize and tailor your experience on the Crazy Egg Website;
  * operate our business;
  * understand how Clients are engaging with Crazy Egg Website and Service;
  * request additional information necessary to process or fulfill an order;
  * assess Client satisfaction with the Crazy Egg Service;
  * inform Clients that an upgrade is available; or to contact Clients with information about Crazy Egg, including information about new or existing products and services or special offers. For example, we may periodically send promotional materials or notifications related to our products and Services to the email address associated with a registered account.
  * Otherwise for our legitimate business interests.



If Information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, Crazy Egg may use it for any business purpose. To the extent Information is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Personal Data.” 

### Use of Cookies by the Service

As described in our Cookie Policy, the Service may utilize first-party cookies (small text files that Crazy Egg stores locally on a Client Site Visitor’s device) on Client Sites for one or more of the following purposes: to help identify whether a Client Site Visitor is a first time visitor, or has visited previously (provided that we will not store identifiers that can be used to personally identify such Client Site Visitors); assess usage patterns and perform traffic analysis; identify preferences; diagnose problems with our Service; analyze trends; and otherwise administer Crazy Egg products and services. Cookies placed by Crazy Egg on the computers of Client Site Visitors do not include Personally Identifiable Information such as name, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address, nor does Crazy Egg link cookies to such Personally Identifiable Information on our servers or databases.

### Information Collected by or on Behalf of Our Clients via the Service

Crazy Egg Clients use the Service to obtain information regarding how Client Site Visitors to their Client Sites are interacting with such Client Sites.

Please note that Crazy Egg itself uses the Crazy Egg Service to obtain insights into Crazy Egg Visitors' activities on http://www.crazyegg.com. Accordingly, Crazy Egg is the Controller of such Information regarding Crazy Egg Visitors. 

  * Types of Client Visitor Information. Crazy Egg Clients may use the Service to collect, store, and analyze Client Visitor Information, on the Client’s behalf as the Controller of such Client Visitor Information, on Crazy Egg's servers, as the Client’s Processor of such Client Visitor Information. Such Client Visitor Information is transmitted in encrypted form, and pursuant to applicable data transfer provisions further described below. The Service may process such Client Visitor Information on behalf of the Client, to perform analyses and produce reports for the Crazy Egg Client. The interactions that may be recorded or analyzed (“Recorded Interactions”) may include mouse scrolls and clicks by a Client Site Visitor; keystrokes entered by a Client Site Visitor; and/or pages viewed or visited by a Client Site Visitor, including the duration of such visits. Recorded Interactions may also include images of the Client Site that are recorded during the Client Site Visitor’s interactions with such Client Site, such as, by way of example, images of forms displayed or populated by the Client Site Visitor on the Client Site, or other multimedia content that may be posted by Client Site Visitors. Such Client Visitor Information may also include Device Information and/or Referral Information from the Client Site Visitor.

### Crazy Egg's Sharing and Disclosure of Crazy Egg Visitor Information and Client Visitor Information.

This section describes the manner and extent to which Crazy Egg may share and disclose Information.

### Do-Not-Track Signals

Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Our practices with respect to such signals are set forth in [https://www.crazyegg.com/opt-out](https://web.archive.org/opt-out).
