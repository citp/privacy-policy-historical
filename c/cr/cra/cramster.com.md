**A2.** This Privacy Policy discloses how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information gathered about you in connection with the Website but specifically excludes personal information collected by third parties (e.g., third party Websites to which a link is provided on the Website). When this Privacy Policy uses the term "personally identifiable information," we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual's name, postal address, e-mail address or telephone number. When other information, such as, for example, date of birth or school, is directly associated with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy. Personally identifiable information is sometimes referred to in this Privacy Policy as "personal information." The terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all applicable laws.

**Kids' Privacy Policy**

The Website and its related products and services are not intended for use by children under 13 years of age and children under 13 may not submit personal information to us.

**Q3. What types of information do we collect online and how do we collect them?**

**A3.** **Information You Provide**

Much of the personally identifiable information we collect comes directly from you during your interaction with the Website. For example, we may collect personal information when you register for a membership (or update your membership information), use or subscribe to our products or services, respond to surveys or submit content or materials to us. This may include your name, mailing address, email address, phone number and credit card information. You may access and update your personal information associated with your membership as described in the Terms of Use, however, information previously submitted by you to us may be retained by us for technical, legal or other reasons.

**Information Collected Through Technology**

We may also collect information through technology to make the Website more useful and for other business purposes. For instance, when you access the Website, we may collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet Service Provider), your company or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we may use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of the Website. We may combine this information with personally identifiable i nformation.

We may also use technologies such as “cookies” and/or “web beacons.” "Cookies" are small data files with a unique identifier that we transfer to your computer's hard drive or web browser and that collect and store data about your visit to the Website. This allows our systems to identify you when you return to the Website. "Web beacons" are small graphic files with a unique identifier contained in our Website that we use to market our services to you and track Website traffic.

We may also allow third party vendors, including Google, to show our ads on the Internet. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to Cramster. You may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page.
