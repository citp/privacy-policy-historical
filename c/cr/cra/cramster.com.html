                        <b>1. Introduction</b>
										<br>
										This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") describes how Cramster, Inc. 
										("Cramster") collects, uses and discloses information from and about visitors 
										to and users of Cramster.com, including unregistered visitors ("Visitors"), 
										registered subscription members ("Members") and registered non-subscription 
										guests ("Guests"), as each category is further described in the Terms of Use, 
										and what choices Members, Guests and Visitors each have regarding the 
										collection and use of such information. This Privacy Policy also explains 
										procedures for the security and protection of the information collected and how 
										you can access and update your information.
										<br>
										<br>
										By registering with the Cramster.com web site ("Web Site") or by using any of 
										the Cramster products or services as a Member or Guest, or by accessing the Web 
										Site as a Visitor, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy, 
										including Cramster's policies with respect to the collection, use and 
										disclosure of personal and non-personal information as described in this 
										Privacy Policy.<br>
										<br>
										<b>2. Information Collected</b>
										<br>
										Cramster collects and stores certain personally identifiable information about 
										you when you provide it to us during registration (or when you update your 
										account information), when you use or subscribe to Cramster's products and 
										services, including when you respond to Cramster surveys or submit content or 
										materials to Cramster (including through the Message Board or Challenge), or 
										when you otherwise communicate with Cramster, such as through emails. The type 
										of personally identifiable information collected may include your name, 
										address, email address, telephone number, credit card information, school, 
										demographic information, and other personal information, depending upon the 
										particular Cramster product or service, the information requested and provided 
										and the category of user.
										<br>
										<br>
										For example, a Member, as part of the registration process, will provide 
										Cramster with the necessary and correct information to properly collect fees 
										due for the use of the Cramster subscription services. Certain information 
										requested by Cramster during the registration process is optional, including 
										providing demographic information, and for Visitors who may wish to participate 
										in surveys, the requested personal information is optional. For a Visitor 
										wishing to receive the monthly Cramster newsletter, only a valid email address 
										is required.<br>
										<br>
										Cramster also collects and stores certain non-personally identifiable 
										information about you when you visit and use the Web Site or otherwise interact

										GIF" (Graphical Interchange Format) technologies, as well as login file 
										information. "Cookies" are small data files with a unique identifier that we 
										transfer to your computer's hard drive or web browser and that collect and 
										store data about your visit to the Web Site. This allows our systems to 
										identify you when you return to the Web Site and to analyze your Web Site 
										usage. "GIFs" are small graphic files with a unique identifier contained in our 
										Web Site that we use to track Web Site traffic. This allows us to monitor and 
										improve the performance of the Web Site and the related services offered and to 
										collect and use the information as described in this Privacy Policy. This 
										non-personally identifiable information will be treated in the same fashion, 
										and in aggregate to, all information provided by a Member, Guest or Visitor.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>3. Use of Information</b>

										except to the extent necessary to process transactions with you, for example, 
										credit card processing companies, however, Cramster may disclose any such 
										information pursuant to law, including subpoena, warrants or other orders; in 
										order to enforce the Terms of Use or other Web Site policies and rules with 
										respect to a particular Cramster product or service, such as the Message Board 
										or Challenge, or any other related agreements between you and Cramster; or as 
										otherwise may be required to protect the rights of Cramster, its directors, 
										officers, representatives and agents, or its Members, Guests or Visitors.<br>
										<br>
										In addition, Cramster may share some or all of your personal information with

										described in the Terms of Use, however, information originally submitted to 
										Cramster by you may be retained by Cramster for technical, legal or other 
										reasons.<br>
