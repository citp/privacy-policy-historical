<h2><a name="info">Information Collection and Use</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Registration and Profile Information</li>
<p>
When you register with us or choose to participate in one of our features on our Sites or otherwise interact with us, you may be asked or required to provide certain information, which may include Personal Information (which is information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as your name and email address), account information (such as a password or other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your account) and demographic or other information (such as your school, gender, age or birthdate and zip code).  We will also collect payment information (typically, credit card account information) if you choose to purchase products or services through the Services.  Any information combined with Personal Information will be treated as Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
You may have the opportunity to create a public profile that is available to others on the internet (“Public Profile”), through which you can post or upload information about yourself, which may include a photograph, information about your academic and work history, your interests and activities and other information. Your Public Profile may be indexed by and displayed by internet search providers when someone searches for your name.  Chegg does not control how frequently third-party search engines update their indexes; consequently their information may be outdated and still available for a period of time even after you discontinue use of the service.  If you do not want your information to be viewable by educational institutions or related third parties, you may close your account.
</p>
<p>
We use information about you, including Personal information and the information you provide  in your Public Profile to:  (1) allow you to participate in features we offer or to provide related customer service, including, without limitation, to respond to your questions, complaints or comments; (2) tailor content recommendations and offers we display to you; (3) process a transaction you initiate; (4) provide you with information, products or services; (5) send you special offers from us, our advertisers, or third-party business partners; (6) process your registration with our Services, including verifying your e-mail address is active and valid; (7) improve the Services and for internal business purposes; (8) contact you with regard to your use of the Services and, in our discretion, changes to our policies; and (9) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or otherwise with your consent. 
<strong>Note that on Zinch.com, educational organizations, scholarship providers and similar third parties will be able to review your Full Profile , whether or not you have limited public access to certain information in your Public Profile.  Chegg does not share your contact information with those third parties unless you request or agree to that sharing.  However, Chegg may send you information and offers from third parties and information about the Services and you may not be able to opt-out from these messages without closing your account with Zinch.com.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Note about Children: Our services are not intended for, marketed to or available to individuals younger than the age of 13, and individuals younger than the age of 13 should not submit personal information to us.
</p><li>Community Forums, User Content, and Posting Content To Third Party Sites</li>
<p>
The Sites may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly in forums, through interactive features and through other communication functionality ("Community Forums").  You may choose, through such features or otherwise, to submit or post photographs, videos, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, (collectively, "User Content").  Your User Content may also be posted in your Public Profile.  You may edit or remove information on your profile.  You may contact Chegg to remove information that you have posted publicly in forums.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="font-style: italic;">
Note that anything you post to a Community Forum or in your Public Profile is public</span>
-- others will have access to your User Content and may use it or share it with third parties. Information you choose to post or make available in the Community Forums may be viewed, collected and used by others. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information in your Public Profile or a Community Forum, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply. Think carefully before you post and use caution before publicly disclosing any Personal Information.
</strong>
</p>
In addition, you may have the ability to contact another user through the Services or “follow” or “friend” other users.  When you contact another user, we may list your name in the header of the message or in the wall post or notification, but we will not include your personal email address.  We allow other users to use contact information they have about you, such as your email address, to find you, including through contact importers and search, and they may also contact you through the Services. 
<p></p>
<p>
Also, the Services may permit interactions between the Services and a third party web site, such as enabling you to “like” a product within our Services or “share” content to other web sites.  If you choose to “like” or “share” content or to otherwise post information from or via the Services to a third party web site, feature or application, that information will become public and the third party web site may have access to information about you and your use of our Services. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
</p>
<li> Information Third Parties Provide About You And Social Media Platforms</li>
<p>
Third parties may provide us with information about you. For example, if you are on a third party web site, and you opt-in to receive information from us, that third party will forward information about you to us so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature through our Services (such as logging in through Facebook Connect or otherwise linking the Services with another web site or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third party web site or service) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information. When you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your activity on our Services with that third party web site or service, which may then collect information about your visits to our Services and may publish that activity as you request to your profile or similar feature with that third party (such as if you choose to share a purchase you made on Chegg.com with your connections on the third party web site).âˆšÂ¢Ã€Ãœâ‰ˆÂ°âˆšÃ‰â€šÃ„Â°âˆšÃ‡Â¬Â¨âˆšÂ¢â€šÃ‡Â¨Â¬â€&nbsp;  The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy.âˆšÂ¢Ã€Ãœâ‰ˆÂ°âˆšÃ‰â€šÃ„Â°âˆšÃ‡Â¬Â¨âˆšÂ¢â€šÃ‡Â¨Â¬â€&nbsp; The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party web site and service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site or service give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service.  Chegg does not store the information in those circumstances.
</p>
<p>
We also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods you have requested. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.
</p>
<li>Referral Features and Gift Certificates</li>
<p>
The Services may offer referral features whereby users may use an email tool to invite friends to use the Services using a one-time email. Chegg stores this information for the purpose of verification, as well as tracking the success of our referral program. Chegg will not use those referred email addresses for any other purpose (unless, of course, the referred user comes to a Service and registers as a user, in which case Chegg may use the email address provided by the referred user in accordance with this Privacy Policy). The referred person may contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@chegg.com">legal</a>  to request that we remove this information from our database.
</p>
<p>
If you purchase a gift certificate for another person, we will ask you for that person's name and email address, as well as for an optional personal message. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email including an invitation to visit the site as well as their gift code. Chegg stores information such as the gift certificate recipient's name and email address for the sole purpose of verification. Chegg does not sell or disclose any of this information to any outside sources or parties and collects this information only to maintain records that a gift certificate was purchased and sent to a recipient. Vouchers purchased through Cheggdeals are not gift certificates and must be used according to the terms of the voucher.
</p>
<li>Information Chegg Collects Automatically When You Access The Services</li>
<p>
Like other websites and online services, we and our analytics providers and other third party service providers may collect certain “Usage Information” whenever you access and use the Services.  Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to our Services, the search terms you entered into a search engine that lead you to our Services (if applicable), all of the areas within our Services that you visit, and the time of day, among other information. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including enhancing or otherwise improving the Services and our products and services.
</p>
<p>
In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for any computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a “Device”) you may use to access the Services. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access a Service, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access a Service. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
Usage Information is collected via tracking technologies, including:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies and Log Files:</strong>
Like most websites, Chegg uses cookies and web log files to track usage of our Services. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer, and which allows Chegg to recognize you as a user when you return using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our Services as fully as intended. Log files are the record of your visits to the Services and include Usage Information.  Like the information you enter at registration or in your Public Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience when you use the Services.
</p>
<p>
One type of cookie we use, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you’ve logged in to your account on the Services. If you do not log out of your account, then the next time you visit, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to log in before using the Services. Of course, if you are using a public computer or sharing your private computer with others, you should log out of your account after each visit. If you log out of a Service, you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. We also use a cookie which functions as a “session” cookie, meaning that it is used to identify a particular visit. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Web Beacons:</strong>
We, as well as our affiliate program partners, third-party tracking utility companies, and service providers employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us of what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users for our affiliate program. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. This information is used to help improve the overall quality and experience of our website.
</p>
<p>
An <strong>Embedded Script</strong> is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device from our server or a third party service provider and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.
</p>
<p>
In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.
</p>
<h2><a name="thirdparty">THIRD PARTY Ad Networks And ANALYTICS PROVIDERS</a></h2>
<p>
Chegg works with network advertisers, ad agencies , third party traffic measurement services and other vendors to serve third party advertisements on and through the Services, to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Services, including the pages viewed and the actions users take when visiting the Services; to serve our advertisements on other web sites, within third party applications, and across the Internet; and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. For example, if you clicked on an advertisement that led you to one of our Services, our service provider(s) may be able to tell us which advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement.  In connection with providing analytics and advertisement services, our service providers may collect certain information about your visits to this or other web sites. We do not share Personal Information with these service providers, but they may set and access their own tracking technologies on your Device (including cookies and web beacons) and may otherwise collect or have access to information about you (such as your general interest in higher education and scholarships and Usage Information). 
</p>
<p>
With regard to advertisements, we and our network advertisers may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to both the Services and other web sites. Tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, including those set by third party network advertisers, may be used to, among other things, target advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, or to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may share Usage Information about visitors with third party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors for similar purposes.  We may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements. You may wish to visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>, which provides information regarding the "opt-out" procedures of certain third party ad servers we may use. 
</p>
<p>
Chegg also works with Truste which gives you the ability to opt out of some or all tailored advertising networks. To learn more about the use of this information or choose not to have this information used by our third-party advertising partners by opting out, please visit the <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/truste/">Truste website</a> here.
</p>
<h2><a name="mobile">MOBILE USE</a></h2>
<p>
If you use the Services through a mobile device or our mobile application, your mobile device ID, your mobile carrier, and your physical (GPS) location may be transmitted to Chegg.  You agree that Chegg may store and use that information for security purposes (for example, for user verification and to ensure that Chegg's APIs are being used appropriately) and, if available, for purposes of assisting you in locating nearby shipping stores, schools or other places of interest. Chegg does not share your location information with third parties except for a location service provider Google Maps.  If you wish to no longer allow Chegg to track your physical locations you may turn this off within your device settings. When you place an order through the Services, you may be able to opt-in to receiving text messaging reminders from Chegg. If you choose to do so, you must provide to Chegg your telephone number, which Chegg will store and use to send reminders to you. You may always opt-out by replying “STOP” to one of the text messages received.  You also acknowledge and agree that use of the Services through a mobile device may cause data to be displayed on and through your mobile device which may be viewed by your mobile carrier or other access provider.
</p>
<h2><a name="sharing">Information Sharing</a></h2>
<p>
Chegg does not share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent.  Chegg may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic information and Usage Information with third parties, and third parties, including third party advertisers, content providers, and analytics providers, may collect such information when you visit the Services. We also may share your Personal Information with third parties with your consent, as disclosed at the time you provide us with information, and as described below or otherwise in this privacy policy: 
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Educational Institutions:</strong>
We work with colleges, universities, scholarship providers and educational institutions (“Educational Institutions”) to provide targeted recruiting and outreach to some of our members. For Services provided on Zinch.com, we allow Educational Institutions to review your Full Profile (such as hometown, grade point average, and graduation year), whether or not you have chosen to restrict public access to some of that information.  However, we do not share your contact information (email address, postal address or phone number) with these Educational Institutions without your consent, but we may send you information on their behalf.  This is a fundamental element of our free Services on Zinch.com.  In addition, you may indicate that you would like to receive additional information from Educational Institutions or other third parties and we will then share your information with those parties so that they may contact you per your request.  We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties, and, if you later decide that you no longer want to receive communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.
</li>
<li><strong>When You Request That We Share Your Information.</strong>
We may offer opportunities and features through the Services that are brought to you by a third party or that otherwise involve sharing your information with a third party.  If you request or agree at that time to have your information shared, your information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party. You also may request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature, a widget or third party application, that we share information about you with a third party and we will typically do so under those circumstances. </li>
<li><strong>Service Providers.</strong>
We will share your Personal Information with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific services to you or to us as part of our Services, but subject to confidentiality obligations which limit their use and disclosure of such information.  If you purchase any products or services, our billing partner will receive billing and financial information (e.g., credit card numbers) necessary to process your charges, including your postal and e-mail addresses, depending on your payment method.
</li>
<p>
If you choose to use the Powered by Chegg® kiosk at a participating Authorized Chegg Affiliate, the affiliate will be provided with your personal information, including your contact information, the books you are renting, and rental fees. These affiliates are permitted to use your Personal Information only for purposes of processing the transaction and providing the service.</p>
<li><strong>Administrative and Legal Reasons.</strong>
We may also disclose your information, including Personal Information,  in response to a subpoena or when required by law; to defend our rights; in response to a written request from law enforcement regarding an investigation into criminal activity that may have occurred through or in any way using Chegg’s Services or property; to provide information to a claimed owner of intellectual property who claims that content you have provided to us infringes on their rights; as part of an investigation into academic integrity; to protect and/or defend any applicable Terms of Use or other policies applicable to the Services; or to protect the personal safety, rights, property or security of any organization or individual. We may also use Device Identifiers, including IP addresses, to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies in our discretion. These disclosures may be carried out without notice to you. </li>
<li><strong>Business Transitions</strong>
Chegg may share Personal Information with its parent, subsidiaries and affiliates, primarily for business and operational purposes.  In the event that Chegg goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process, your information, including Personal Information,  will likely be among the assets transferred. This Privacy Policy will become binding upon the new owner of the information until amended. </li>
<li><strong> Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions.</strong>
We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions ("Promotion") that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to governing terms, conditions or official rules, which may contain specific requirements of you, including allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules, such as on a winners list.
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="updating">UPDATING Your Account Information AND Control over your profile</a></h2>
<p>
You may be able to review the information you provided to us on a Service and make any desired changes to the information, or to the settings for your account on that Service, by logging in to your account for that Service and editing the information. You also may be able to limit the information you receive from us by adjusting your settings.  For Zinch.com, we reserve the right to send you information on our behalf and on behalf of third parties in connection with our providing the Services and therefore, with regard to Zinch.com, if you no longer want to receive information from us, you will need to close your account for that Service.
</p>
<p>
Please note that the default setting in any Public Profile on a Service may be that the information in your Public Profile is available to everyone on the internet.  This is the case on Zinch.com, where the default setting is for your Public Profile to be public.  You may be able to customize your Public Profile and opt out of making certain information visible to the public.  For Zinch.com, note that if you choose to remove certain information from your Public Profile, such information will still be available for viewing and use by Educational Institutions and Chegg.
</p>
<h2><a name="closing">Closing Your Account</a></h2>
<p>
If you wish to close your account with Zinch.com, please send your request to <a href="mailto:help@zinch.com">help@zinch.com</a> and we will remove your Personal Information and Public Profile, if applicable, from the active databases.   If you wish to close your account on any of our other Services, please send your request to <a href="mailto:optout@chegg.com">optout</a>.  Please send your request using an email account that you have registered with Chegg under your name. You will receive a response to a request sent to <a href="mailto:optout@chegg.com">optout</a> within five business days of our receiving it.  Closing your account on one of our Services does not necessarily mean you have closed your account on another one of our Services, and therefore, you may continue to receive communications from Chegg in relation to your membership on another Service.
</p>
<p>
Even if your account is closed, information may remain in backup records and we may retain certain data if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery or if required by law. All retained data will continue to be subject to the terms of the applicable privacy policy for the Service.  Also, if you have posted content on or through the Services, such as in Community Forums, we may not be able to delete it.</p>
<h2><a name="thirdpartycontent">THIRD PARTY CONTENT, LINKS TO OTHER SITES, AND CHEGG CONTENT FOUND OUTSIDE OF THE SITE</a></h2>
<p>
Certain content provided through the Services may be hosted and served by third parties, which may include third party widgets (such as those that allow you to “like” or “share” content with third party web sites and online services.  In addition, the Services may link to third party web sites or content over which Chegg has no control and which are governed by the privacy policies and business practices of those third parties. In addition, third-party partners of Chegg from whom your order through the Services may have different privacy policies which apply to such partner’s use of your information. 
</p>

<h2><a name="security">Security</a></h2>
<p>
Chegg takes commercially reasonable security measures to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, when you enter sensitive information such as a geolocation data, credit card number and CCV2 number on our checkout forms, that information is encrypted using secure socket layer (SSL) technology, to help protect the communications between you and our payment partners.
</p>
<p>
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, as in any real-life scenario, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

<h2><a name="california">California Residents - Your CA Privacy
Rights</a></h2>
<p>
Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of
California have the right to request from companies conducting business in
California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed
certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the
third partiesâˆšÂ¢â€šÃ‡Â¨â€šÃ‘Â¢ direct marketing purposes and the categories of personal
information the company shares. Alternatively, the law provides that a company
that has a privacy policy that provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in)
regarding sharing personal information with third parties for those third
partiesâˆšÂ¢â€šÃ‡Â¨â€šÃ‘Â¢ direct marketing purposes may instead provide information on how to
exercise that choice. Chegg qualifies for the alternative option; it has a
comprehensive privacy policy that sets forth that Chegg provides you choice
prior to sharing your personal information with third parties for their direct
marketing purposes.  If you do not opt-in or if you do not choose to opt-out
at the time Chegg offers that choice, Chegg does not share your information
with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes. 
</p>
<p>
If you are a California resident and you have questions about  our practices
with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct
marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your
request to the following email address: <a href="mailto:legal@chegg.com">legal</a> or write to us at
the following mailing address: 2350 Mission College Blvd., Suite 1400, Santa
Clara, CA 95054.  You must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights"
in the subject field of your e-mail or include it in your writing if you
choose to write to us at the designated mailing address.  You must include
your name, street address, city, state, and zip code.  We are not responsible
for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete
information. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request
per customer each year.
</p>
<p>

information may be shared with third parties for purposes other than the
direct marketing use by third parties, please review our privacy policy at
