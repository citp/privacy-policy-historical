      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"> Welcome to CrystalGraphics' Internet website! 
        We are proud to have this opportunity to tell you a little about our products 
        and our company. We are confident you like what you see. But before you 
        begin exploring, we'd like to review the steps we have taken to ensure 
        that on-line visitors of all ages have a safe, enjoyable experience.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"><strong>Our Commitment to Privacy</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"> Your privacy is important to us. At CrystalGraphics, 
        we value our customers’ privacy and have made it our policy to provide 
        on-line content that requires minimal collection of information from our 
        visitors. Furthermore, to better protect your privacy we provide this 
        notice explaining our on-line information practices and the choices you 
        can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make 
        this notice easy to find, we intend to make it available on our homepage 
        and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. 
        Any significant changes to this Privacy Policy shall be printed in blue 
        italics for a period of 30 days.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"><strong> How We Collect Information</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"> Below are some of the ways in which a visitor 
        may provide information to us on-line and how we may use that information.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"><strong> Domain Name Recognition</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"> Our web servers automatically recognizes 
        a visitor's domain name, however, they do not recognize a visitor's e-mail.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"><strong> Use of Cookies</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"> Cookies are small bits of information that 
        a website transfers to an individual's computer for record keeping purposes. 
        We use cookies in a variety of ways to create a more personalized on-line 
        experience for the user. These cookies contain no personal information 
        about you and no one but CrystalGraphics can retrieve the cookies. These 
        cookies are stored within your browser. Information which may be obtained 
        through cookies is not sold, rented or provided to third parties and is 
        not used internally by CrystalGraphics for any purpose other than to learn 
        in the aggregate which websites may have referred our website visitors, 
        as well as to enhance your experience on our website.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"><strong> Information Actively Provided by 
        Our Visitors</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"> We do not require visitors to register or 
        provide any information before entering our websites. However, there are 
        several places where visitors may choose to provide personally identifiable 
        information about themselves. CrystalGraphics treats this information 
        as strictly confidential. Unless we tell you otherwise, CrystalGraphics 
        uses the information only for the purpose it was provided and will not 
        give, lease, trade, share or sell this personal information to another 
        entity or person outside of CrystalGraphics. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"><strong>For example:</strong></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"> <strong>E-Newsletters:</strong> Some 
          of our pages permit you to register to receive e-mail newsletters and/or 
          product or promotional update emails in the future by providing your 
          name and e-mail address. We will not give, lease, trade, share or sell 
          these names or email addresses to another entity or person outside of 
          CrystalGraphics. Any e-mail you receive from CrystalGraphics will allow 
          you to "unsubscribe" from this informational service at any 
          time. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"> <strong>Free or Trial Product Downloads: 
          </strong>Some of our pages permit you to download free or trial software 
          after providing your name and e-mail address. Generally, just below 
          those name and email fields, you are also provided with an option to 
          receive e-mail newsletters and/or product or promotional update emails 
          in the future. We will not give, lease, trade, share or sell these names 
          or email addresses to another entity or person outside of CrystalGraphics. 
          Any e-mail you receive from CrystalGraphics will allow you to unsubscribe 
          from this informational service at any time.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"><strong> Purchase Pages</strong>: You 
          may also buy products on our website, in which case you will be asked 
          for your name, address and credit card or other payment information. 
          This information will be treated by CrystalGraphics as strictly confidential 
          and is used by CrystalGraphics only for the purpose of verifying and 
          collecting the payment and shipping the order to you at the address 
          specified. It is never provided in any form to any person outside CrystalGraphics 
          or to any other company, except that your name and address are provided 
          to our shipping company and, in some cases, to the government for tax 
          purposes, if required by law. Any follow-up or product or promotional 
          e-mail you receive from CrystalGraphics after your purchase will allow 
          you to unsubscribe from this informational service at any time.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"><strong> Questions</strong>: On some pages 
          our visitors can submit comments or ask questions. The only personally 
          identifiable information that we collect is the sender’s name 
          and e-mail address. We will not give, lease, trade, share or sell these 
          names or email addresses to another entity or person outside of CrystalGraphics. 
          We do not save any personally identifiable information associated with 
          comments, and we only save e-mail addresses associated with questions 
          in order to respond to those questions.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"><strong> Sweepstakes</strong>: We occasionally 
          offer sweepstakes on our pages. We collect the name and email addresses 
          of the people entering the sweepstakes. Rarely, this information may 
          be shared with the company providing the sweepstakes prizes, but if 
          so, this fact will be clearly stated in the online entry form. Otherwise, 
          we will not give, lease, trade, share or sell these names or email addresses 
          to another entity or person outside of CrystalGraphics. Of course, we 
          also collect the information necessary for prize fulfillment from those 
          who win. If a prize is valued at over $600, a social security number 
          will be requested. The first initial, last name, hometown and state 
          of all winners will be included on a Winners List. The Winners List 
          will be provided upon request and as required by law. Information required 
          for tax purposes, email addresses, the Winner’s List or other 
          information required by law is kept as required by law. All other information 
          is deleted within 60 days of the final selection of the sweepstakes’ 
          prize winners.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"><strong> Other Features</strong>: There 
          may be other features available on our website which may require some 
          personally identifiable information to use the feature. We only use 
          the personally identifiable information to provide the feature and delete 
          it within a reasonable period of time after the information is no longer 
          necessary.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"><strong>Unsubscribing from Our Email List</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"> Every promotional 
        e-mail you receive from CrystalGraphics should offer you the means to 
        easily unsubscribe from CrystalGraphics’ mailing list within 72 
        hours. If you have difficulties using this feature, or want to report 
        any problems with its effectiveness, you may report any such problems 
        and/or request that you be immediately unsubscribed by <a href="mailto:%20abuse@CrystalGraphics.com">contacting 
        us</a>. If you want to find out how and when you got on our mailing list, 
        you may also contact us at this same email address.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"><strong> Aggregate Information</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"> Aggregate information about which pages 
        visitors visit is only used for internal review as we continue to improve 
        our website. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"><strong>Our Commitment to Data Security</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"> To prevent unauthorized access, maintain 
        data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put 
        in place appropriate and effective physical, electronic, and managerial 
        procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect on-line.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"><strong> This Privacy Policy Is For Our On-line

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" style="font-size:12px"> Our policy is to occasionally provide electronic 
        links to other sites which may be of interest to visitors to our website. 
        However, content on websites can change quickly, so we cannot always guarantee 
        the appropriateness of the content of sites we link to.</font></p>
