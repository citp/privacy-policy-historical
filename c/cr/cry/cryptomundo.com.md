Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

By accepting a cookie from the Cryptomundo Site, users will not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on the site’s discussion board. We store a cookie on each user’s machine that contains a username and encrypted password. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, you may not be able to use Cryptomundo products or services that require you to sign in, and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings.
