<h3>Collection and Use of Information Collected Automatically</h3>
<p>We receive and store certain types of information automatically, such as whenever you interact with the sites or use our services. This information does not necessarily reveal your identity directly but may include information about the specific device you are using, such as the hardware model, device ID, operating system version, web-browser software (such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer) and your Internet Protocol (IP) address/MAC address/device identifier.</p>
<p>When you visit our website, our web servers gather your IP address to assist with the diagnosis of problems and to enable us to provide the best level of service.</p>
<p>We use cookies on our website to provide you with a better experience. These cookies allow us to increase your security by storing your session ID and are a way of monitoring single user access. This aggregate, non-personal information is collated and provided to us to assist in analysing the usage of the site.</p>
<h3>Management of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We strive to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personal information submitted to us, and we regularly review and update our security measures in light of current technologies.</p>
<p>While no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure, we will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to ensure the security, on our systems, of the personal information you transmit to us via our online products and services.</p>
<p>In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by us.</p>
<h3>Use of Information</h3>
<p>Unless we disclose other uses in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection, personal information about you is used only for the purpose for which it is submitted or for such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose. In general, the purposes for which your personal information is collected, used, held and disclosed are:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>to conduct our business;</li>
<li>to provide you with our services and any other services you request;</li>
<li>to market our services to you;</li>
<li>to engage with third parties on your behalf;</li>
<li>to communicate with you;</li>
<li>to help us manage and enhance our services; and</li>
<li>to comply with our legal obligations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Copies of correspondence sent by you, or from the website that may contain your personal information, are stored as archives for record-keeping and back-up purposes only. All communication from us (including information with regards to new products and services) will provide you with an opportunity to opt out of further communication. You can choose to opt out at any time from receiving marketing communications.</p>
<p>We do not allow the selling of your personal information in any way.</p>
<h3>Retention and Disclosure of Information</h3>
<p>We take care to allow your personal information to be accessed only by those employees who require it in order to perform their tasks and duties, and to share with third parties who have a legitimate purpose for accessing it.</p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>where you have consented;</li>
<li>where disclosure is necessary to achieve the purpose for which the personal information was submitted; or</li>
<li>when the law permits or requires disclosure.</li>
</ol>
<p>We may also disclose your personal information in special situations where we have reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering with (intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.</p>
<p>We may engage third parties to support our operations and/or provide you with services on our behalf (such as identity verification agencies, credit reporting agencies, and outsourced IT service providers). Where we deem it necessary we may disclose personal information held by us to these third parties solely for the purpose of, and in connection with, performing the particular service or function that we have engaged the third party to provide.</p>
<p>We generally retain personal data for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes for which it was obtained. To dispose of personal data, we may anonymise it, delete it or take other appropriate steps.</p>
<p>Where we no longer require your personal information, we will comply with our legal requirements in respect of that information.</p>
<h3>Access to Information</h3>
<p>We will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep secure any information which we hold about you, and to keep this information accurate and up to date.</p>
<p>The majority of the information that we hold about you will be available for you to review by logging into your online account with us.</p>
<p>Subject to the exceptions set out in the Privacy Act 1993, you may seek access to the personal information that we hold about you. We will require you to verify your identity, and to specify what information you require. A fee may be charged for providing access. If a fee is to be charged, we will advise you of the likely cost in advance.</p>
<p>If, at any time, you discover that information held about you is incorrect, you may contact us to request to have the information corrected in accordance with the Privacy Act 1993.</p>
<h3>Links to External Websites</h3>
<p>We provide links to websites outside of our websites, as well as to third party websites. These linked sites are not under our control, and we cannot accept responsibility for the conduct of companies linked to our website. Before disclosing your personal information on any other website, we advise you to examine the terms and conditions of using that website and its privacy statement.</p>
<h3>Legal bases for processing personal information</h3>
<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to process, use or disclose your personal data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>you consent to such processing;</li>
<li>such processing is required to satisfy our legal obligations;</li>
<li>such processing is necessary in order to carry out our obligations as part of any contracts we may have with you, or as part of negotiations before entering into a contract with you; or</li>
<li>such processing is required in order for us to protect our property and rights, or the safety of Cryptopia Limited, our users, contractors, or other affiliates.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Direct Marketing</h3>
<p>If you are a current user, we will only contact you by electronic means (email or SMS) with information regarding any services which are similar or related to those in which you have previously expressed an interest, be that through transaction history or enquiry.</p>
<p>If you are a new user, we will only contact you by electronic means for marketing purposes if you have consented to receive such communications. Direct marketing includes any communications to you regarding advertising or the promotion of products and services. If you do not want to receive marketing communications, at any time and free of charge, you may use the opt-out link provided in any communication from us, or contact us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@cryptopia.co.nz">privacypolicy@cryptopia.co.nz</a>.</p>
<h3>Individual Rights</h3>
<p>We believe that users should be treated equally no matter where they are, and so we are making the following options to control your data available to all users regardless of their location.</p>
<p>You can update certain information by logging into your account with us and accessing your account information and settings. You can also contact us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@cryptopia.co.nz">privacypolicy@cryptopia.co.nz</a> so that we may consider your request under applicable law.</p>
<p>We encourage you to make any individual rights requests through our user support process (<a href="https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Support">https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Support</a>) because this ensures that you have been authenticated already. Otherwise, when we receive an individual rights request via email we may take steps to verify your identity before complying with the request to protect your privacy and security.</p>
<p><strong>Right to withdraw consent.</strong> You have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information collected on the basis of your consent at any time. Please note that withdrawing this consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing we may have undertaken prior to the withdrawal of consent. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing of information for which consent is not required.</p>
<p><strong>Right of access to and rectification of your personal information.</strong> You have the right to request that we provide you with a copy of all personal information pertaining to you that we hold. This information will be provided without undue delay, unless such provision adversely affects the rights and freedoms of other users, contractors or affiliates of Cryptopia Limited. If a fee is to be charged for this service, the full amount will be made known to you in advance. You may also request that we rectify any false personal information pertaining to you that we keep on record. Your right to access and rectification shall only be limited where the expense of providing such access becomes disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or where the rights of other users, contractors or affiliates may be violated.</p>
<p><strong>Right to erasure.</strong> You have the right to request that we erase personal information that pertains to you if that information:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected;</li>
<li>was collected in relation to processing to which you had previously consented, but later withdrew such consent; or</li>
<li>was collected in relation to processing activities to which you object, and there are no legitimate overriding grounds for such activities.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we have made your personal information public and are obliged to erase that information, we will take reasonable steps to inform relevant third parties that are processing your personal information that you have requested the erasure, including all links to, or copies or replications of, your personal information. The above is subject to limitations by relevant data protection laws.</p>
<p><strong>Right to data portability.</strong> You have the right to request that we make available any personal information pertaining to you, which we obtained through a contract with you or based on your consent, in a structured, commonly-used and machine-readable format. You may also request that we transfer this information directly to another "controller" where technically feasible, unless the exercise of this right adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others. A "controller" is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Right to restrict or object to processing.</strong> You have the right to restrict or object to us processing your personal information where one of the following applies:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>You contest the accuracy of your personal information that we processed. In such instances, we will restrict processing during the period necessary for us to verify the accuracy of your personal information.</li>
<li>The processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information and request the restriction of its use instead.</li>
<li>We no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but it is required by you to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.</li>
<li>You have objected to processing, pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of our processing override your rights.</li>
</ol>
<p>Restricted personal information shall only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest. We will inform you if the restriction is lifted.</p>
<p><strong>Notification of erasure, rectification and restriction.</strong> We will communicate any rectification or erasure of your personal information or restriction of processing to each recipient to whom your personal information has been disclosed, if any, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will inform you about those recipients if you request this information.</p>
<p><strong>Right to object to processing.</strong> Where the processing of your personal information is based on consent, contract or legitimate interests you may restrict or object, at any time, to the processing of your personal information as permitted by applicable law. We can continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the defence of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>Automated individual decision-making, including profiling.</strong> You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your personal information, including profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects on you, save for the exceptions applicable under relevant data protection laws.</p>
<p><strong>Right to lodge a complaint.</strong> If you believe that we have infringed your rights, we encourage you to contact us first at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@cryptopia.co.nz">dataprotection@cryptopia.co.nz</a> so that we can try to resolve the issue or dispute. You can also complain about our processing of your personal information to the relevant data protection authority. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you can complain in the EU member state where you live or work, or in the place where the alleged breach of data protection law has taken place.</p>
<p>You can also complain to the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner.</p>
