Your personal information, including all contact information is held as strictly confidential. We will not sell or rent any of the information you provide through this website. We may have to call or email you from time to time to get clarity on an order detail or to provide you with order updates. We will do so only when it is absolutely necessary and we will not abuse this privilege. We will not publish the details of your order or item details on the exterior of the package so as to help avoid theft in transit.

Please note that given the nature of the products we offer, we do cooperate with law enforcement to stop the use of body armor by criminals or those who are not authorized to obtain it. That is to say, if we have reason to believe that you have used body armor in a criminal activity or, as a criminal, you attempted to purchase body armor, we will share that information with the legal authorities.
