Personal Information Collected Automatically  
As you navigate the Site, certain information will be collected automatically. We collect your domain name in order to measure and track your use of the Site. This data helps us to improve the content of the Site and to customize the content or layout of the Site for you. We may also collect your e-mail address to the extent that it is automatically recognized by our servers. 

We use cookies on the Site to collect Personal Information from you to allow us to understand the areas of the Site that are of interest to you. This helps us to better serve you and to provide you with tailored information upon your visit. A cookie is an element of data that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a website. Cadence uses both session cookies (which expire once you close your Web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some areas of the Site may not function properly. 

Use of Personal Information  
We collect Personal Information from you to fulfill your requests. For example, we may use your Personal Information to process an employment application, should you submit one to us. We may also use your Personal Information to send you information that you requested, or to confirm registrations, purchases, or service request submissions. 

We may use your e-mail address to notify you of products or services that may interest you, such as to keep you informed about events or other items of interest, to notify you of recent updates to our Site, or to provide you with product news notification (such as patch releases). You may opt-out from receiving promotional or marketing e-mails by notifying us at the address specified at the bottom of any unwanted e-mail. These opt-out procedures may not be available for transactional or relationship messages, such as e-mails that are necessary to provide you with confirmation of a completed transaction (such as a purchase, service request, or change in your user profile), to provide you with warranty information regarding a particular product you purchased, provide notification of changes of terms of service, or to provide you with important information about the use of a product that you have purchased or software that you have downloaded. 

We may use your mailing address or telephone number for a variety of Cadence-related reasons. We may send you periodic mailings or telephone you to inform you of new products, services, or events. If you do not wish to receive such calls, you may request to be removed from the call list at the time of the call. 

We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Information to perform statistical analyses of users' aggregate behavior so that we may enhance the content of our services and improve site navigation. 

Disclosure of Personal Information  
Your Personal Information will generally not be shared, sold, traded, or rented to individuals or other entities (such as direct mail organizations). However, we may need to provide your Personal Information to third parties to charge your credit card or deliver specific services to you (such as support services or shipping). These third parties are required not to use your Personal Information other than to provide the services requested by Cadence. 

Although we currently do not share your Personal Information with our affiliates, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "affiliates"), we may in the future. If we decide to share some or all of your Personal Information with any of these affiliates, we will require such affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Cadence; or (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Cadence or users of the Site. 

Editing Your Personal Profile  
We realize that your Personal Information, including your name, company, and e-mail address, is subject to change. To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, we wish to maintain its accuracy. In some cases, we provide a means to create an account or a profile of information. For example, to change your Personal Information in SourceLink, log in as usual and select the "Update Profile" link found on the top left side of MySourceLink. Information may be given directly to a Cadence Customer Support representative. 

Security of Your Personal Information  
We safeguard the Personal Information you send to us with certain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. If you have established an account with us, your Cadence account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. In most areas of the Site, we use industry-standard-encryption to enhance the security of data transmissions. In other areas, we notify you with a pop-up screen when we transfer or receive certain types of sensitive information. We also store your Personal Information behind our firewall and utilize appropriate security measures in our physical facilities to prevent loss or unauthorized use of sensitive information. Except as provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Cadence limits access to Personal Information in electronic databases to those persons (including employees and contractors) in Cadence's organization who have a business need for such access. 

While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us, and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. We suggest that you change your passwords often, use passwords that include a combination of letters and numbers, and use a secure browser. Products and services are available which can help give you privacy protection while navigating the Internet. See [www.privacyalliance.org/resources/](http://www.privacyalliance.org/resources/) for an overview of many privacy-related tools. While we do not anticipate breaches in security, if one occurs, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the problem that led to the breach. 

Regarding Children  
We do not structure our websites to attract children. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone under 13 years of age. 

Links to Other Sites  
Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of our Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites.
