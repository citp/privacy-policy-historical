###  **What are cookies?**

A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can recognize you when you return, as well as remember certain information about you, which can include pages you visited, choices you made from menus, any specific information you entered into forms and the time and date of your visit. 

  


###  **Types of Cookies**

There are two main types of cookies:

  * **Session cookies:**  These are temporary cookies that expire at the end of a browser session, that is, when you leave the site. Session cookies allow the website to recognize you as you navigate between pages during a single browser session and allow you to use the website most efficiently. For example, session cookies enable a website to remember that a user placed items in an online shopping basket. 
  * **Persistent cookies:**  In contrast to session cookies, persistent cookies are stored on your equipment between browser sessions until they expire or you delete them. They therefore enable the website to "recognize" you when you return, remember your preferences and tailor services to you. 



In addition to session cookies and persistent cookies, the website you've chosen to visit, such as this website, may set other cookies to provide us or third parties with information.

##  **Security**

This Internet Banking System brings together a combination of industry-approved security technologies to protect data for the bank and for you, our customer. It features password-controlled system entry, a VeriSign-issued Digital ID for the bank's server, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol for data encryption, and a router with a firewall to regulate the inflow and outflow of server traffic.

  


###  **Secure Access and Verifying User Authenticity**

To begin a session with the bank's server the user must key in a Log-in ID and a password. Our system, the Internet Banking System, uses a "3 strikes and you're out" lock-out mechanism to deter users from repeated login attempts. After three unsuccessful login attempts, the system locks the user out, requiring either a designated wait period or a phone call to the bank to verify the password before re-entry into the system. Upon successful login, the Digital ID from VeriSign, the experts in digital identification certificates, authenticates the user's identity and establishes a secure session with that visitor.

  


###  **Secure Data Transfer**

Once the server session is established, the user and the server are in a secured environment. Because the server has been certified as a 128-bit secure server by VeriSign, data traveling between the user and the server is encrypted with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. With SSL, data that travels between the bank and customer is encrypted and can only be decrypted with the public and private key pair. In short, the bank's server issues a public key to the end user's browser and creates a temporary private key. These two keys are the only combination possible for that session. When the session is complete, the keys expire and the whole process starts over when a new end user makes a server session.

  


###  **Router and Firewall**

Requests must filter through a router and firewall before they are permitted to reach the server. A router, a piece of hardware, works in conjunction with the firewall, a piece of software, to block and direct traffic coming to the server. The configuration begins by disallowing ALL traffic and then opens holes only when necessary to process acceptable data requests, such as retrieving web pages or sending customer requests to the bank. Using the above technologies, your Internet banking transactions are secure.
