		 <h1>Privacy statement</h1>	    
			
			<p>At Cancer Research UK we are committed to protecting your privacy. This statement describes how Cancer Research UK collects and uses personal information about people who visit our websites. The terms of this statement may change, so please check it from time to time.</p>

<p>If you have any queries about this privacy statement please contact the Data Protection Coordinator at the Legal Department, Cancer Research UK, Angel Building, 407 St John Street, London EC1V 4AD or email <a href="mailto:dataprotection@cancer.org.uk">dataprotection@cancer.org.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>How do we collect information?</h2>

<p>We obtain personal information from you when you enquire about our activities, register with us, send or receive an e-postcard, make a donation to us, ask a question about cancer or otherwise provide us with personal information. We may also receive information about you from third parties, for example from our service providers or from a friend who wants to tell you about our websites or the fundraising activities we carry out.</p>

<h2>What information do we collect?</h2>

<p>The personal information we collect might include name, date of birth, email address, postal address, telephone number and credit/debit card details. We may also collect health information if you tell us about your cancer experience or the experiences of a friend or relative.</p>

<p>We also gather general information about the use of our websites, such as which pages users visit most often and which services, events or facilities are of most interest. We may also track which pages users visit when they click on links in Cancer Research UK emails. We may use this information to personalise the way our websites are presented when users visit them, to make improvements to our websites and to ensure we provide the best service for users. Wherever possible we use aggregated or anonymous information which does not identify individual visitors to our websites.</p>

<h2>How do we use this information?</h2>

<p>We will use your personal information:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide you with the services, products or information you have requested;</li>

<li>to create an account for you if you register with us;</li>

<li>for administration purposes;</li>

<li>to further our charitable aims, including for fundraising activities.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
As part of this, we may analyse the personal information we collect to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that we can contact you in the most appropriate way and with the most relevant information. Where relevant, we may also assess your personal information for the purposes of fraud and credit risk reduction.</p>

<p>If you enter your contact details in one of our online registration forms, we may use this information to contact you even if you don’t “send” or “submit” the form. We will only do this to see if we can help with any problems you might be experiencing with the form or with our websites.</p>

<p>We may need to share your information with our service providers, associated organisations and agents for the purposes described above.</p>

<h2>Cancer information nurses</h2>

<p>If you contact the <a href="http://aboutus.cancerresearchuk.org/contact-us/contact-our-cancer-information-nurses/">cancer information nurses</a>, either through CancerHelp UK or directly, you may choose to provide details of a personal nature. Only the cancer information nurses will use your personal information and only for the purposes of dealing with your enquiry. They will not pass on your details to anyone else without your express permission, except in exceptional circumstances to comply with the nurses’ code of professional conduct or the law. Examples of this might include children contacting the service reporting abuse, anyone reporting serious self harm, anyone expressing the intention of harming someone else, or if a terrorist threat is reported.</p>

<p>Your personal information and details of the enquiries received are stored on a secure database. If for any reason you wish to have your personal details removed from their records, please <a href="ssNODELINK/SendAQuestion">contact the cancer information nurses</a>.</p>

<p>If you send feedback to the CancerHelp UK team, the feedback will be noted and your contact details kept for a maximum of 3 months. If you have sent a complaint to the site, the correspondence will be kept securely in a complaints file for a maximum of one year, in case we need to refer back to it.</p>

<h2>Your choices</h2>

<p>You have a choice about whether you want to receive information about our progress and fundraising activities. We will not use your personal information for marketing purposes if you have indicated that you do not wish to be contacted. You can change your marketing preferences at any time by contacting Supporter Services at Cancer Research UK, Angel Building, 407 St John Street, London EC1V 4AD, by phone on 020 7121 6699, or email <a href="mailto:supporter.services@cancer.org.uk">supporter.services@cancer.org.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Under 16s</h2>

<p>Cancer Research UK is concerned to protect the privacy of children aged under 16. Some of our websites, such as Race for Life, have specific rules about how children under 16 can take part in our events. Where appropriate we will seek consent from a parent or guardian before collecting personal information about a child aged under 16.</p>

<h2>Do we use 'cookies' ?</h2>

<p>'Cookies' are small pieces of information sent by a web server to a web browser which enable the server to collect information from the browser. Essentially it takes the form of a small text file deposited on your computer's hard drive. Our websites use both persistent and session cookies. Persistent cookies are cookies that stay on your computer permanently until you “manually” delete them. Session cookies delete themselves automatically when you leave a website and go to another one or shut down your browser.</p>

<p>Cancer Research UK uses cookies to ensure that you can interact with our websites successfully, to keep track of your browsing patterns and to help you use your account if you have registered with us. Cookies can help to give you a more personalised web experience. The use of cookies does not allow us to access any other information on your computer nor does it affect your experience of using any other websites.</p>

<p>If you want to prevent our cookies being stored on your computer in future, you can easily change your web browser setting to refuse cookies, or to notify you when you receive a new cookie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can do this by clicking on the "Help" menu. You can also delete these cookies. Please note however that if you disable or delete our cookies your use of our websites may be restricted and you may not be able to access all the services or facilities on our sites. Further information on deleting or controlling cookies is available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.AboutCookies.org">www.AboutCookies.org</a>.</p>

<h2>How do we protect personal information?</h2>

<p>All of our online forms are protected by encryption. We also use a secure server when you make a donation or payment via our websites. We take appropriate measures to ensure that the personal information disclosed to us is kept secure, accurate and up to date and kept only for so long as is necessary for the purposes for which it is used.</p>

<h2>Will we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?</h2>

<p>As indicated above, we may pass your information to our service providers, agents and associated organisations for the purpose of completing tasks and providing services to you (other than information provided in a query to CancerHelp UK or the cancer information nurse teams). Where we use service providers we will make sure there are appropriate controls in place.</p>

<p>We may also need to disclose your information if required by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies) or if we have your permission to do so.</p>

<p>We will not sell any information about your web browsing activity.</p>

<h2>Your consent</h2>

<p>By providing us with your personal data, including sensitive personal data such as on your health, you consent to the collection and use of this information in accordance with the purposes described above and this privacy statement.</p>

<p>You also consent to our transferring your information to countries or jurisdictions outside the UK if necessary for the above purposes. These countries may not provide the same level of data protection as the UK. If we do make such a transfer, we will, if appropriate, put appropriate controls in place to ensure your information is protected.</p>

<h2>Right of access</h2>

<p>If you have created an account with us, you can sign into your account to access and update your information.</p>

<p>You have the right to ask for a copy of the information we hold about you (for which we may charge a small fee) and to have any inaccuracies in your information corrected. If you wish to exercise these rights, contact Supporter Services at Cancer Research UK, Angel Building, 407 St John Street, London EC1V 4AD or email <a href="mailto:supporter.services@cancer.org.uk">supporter.services@cancer.org.uk</a></p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>Our websites may include links to websites run by other organisations. Cancer Research UK is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other websites so you should read their privacy policies carefully.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>If your personal details change, please help us to keep your information up to date by notifying us at the above address.</p>

<p>We may change the terms of this privacy statement from time to time. If we do so, we will post the changes here so please check from time to time. By continuing to use our websites you will be deemed to have accepted such changes.</p>
