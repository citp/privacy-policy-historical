# CCCU Cookies Privacy Notice

## General

  * This Policy explains what types of personal information will be gathered when you visit the Website of Canterbury Christ Church University ("the University"), and how this information will be used. Although this Website provides links to other websites, this policy applies only to the University's Webpages.
  * The University has a commitment to protecting your privacy and respecting the confidentiality of information you provide when you visit the University's Websites at either 'canterbury.ac.uk' or 'cant.ac.uk'. At the same time, the University seeks to ensure that you obtain value from the Website and from the services that you may want to receive.
  * The University is registered as a data controller under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018 ('the 2018 Act'). The University upholds the relevant data protection principles and processes all personally identifiable information about you ("personal data") in accordance with the GDPR and the 2018 Act and other relevant legislation. This Privacy Policy explains what information we may collect about you when you visit the University's Website and how we may use it.
  * You should read this Privacy Policy in conjunction with the University's Website terms and conditions of use, of which this Privacy Policy forms a part. By agreeing to these terms and conditions, you are consenting to the University's processing of your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The University will post any changes to this Privacy Policy on the University's Website.



## Information collected

  * It is possible to use the University's Website without providing any personal data. However, the University may automatically collect certain information about you when you use the Website, including by using “cookies” (see below), such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer and the dates and times of your visits.
  * In some areas of the University's Website you may be asked for personal data, such as your name, address and e-mail details, to make your site visit a more rewarding experience for you or to contact you afterwards. This might be where you complete an online form requesting a copy of a prospectus, book a place on an open day, request information about a job vacancy, or subscribe to an online newsletter.
  * In some other areas of the University's Website, where you can register as an online user, you may need to supply further personal data.



## Use of information collected

  * The University holds and processes personal data collected about you through the University's Website by using University computers and computing systems. The University retains this data for a reasonable period or for as long as the law requires.
  * The University will not disclose any of your personal data collected to any third party, unless required to do so by law, other than in circumstances set out in this policy. There may be circumstances in which the University asks you to agree to the disclosing of your personal data to certain third parties, or transferring it outside the United Kingdom. However, before transferring your personal data in these circumstances, the University will seek to ensure appropriate arrangements are in place to protect your privacy.
  * The University may use personal data collected from you by means of the University's Website to manage and monitor use of the Website. Otherwise, the University will only use personal data for the purposes for which it was collected, unless you gave consent to use it for other stated purposes. For example, if you supply your name and address so the University can send you a prospectus, and, at the same time, you agree we may send you similar information in the future, we may subsequently invite you to an open day.
  * If at any time you want to withdraw any permission you have given us to provide you with services, or to use your personal data in any other way, you can do so by [contacting the Data Protection Officer](mailto:foi@canterbury.ac.uk "email foi@canterbury.ac.uk").



## Cookies

  * When you visit the University's Website, your computer may be issued with a small file (a "cookie") for the purposes of managing and improving the services on the Website, even if you do not provide us with any personal data. Cookies recognise you, by a unique number allocated to you, when you return to the Website and may personalise your return, for example by customising Webpages based on areas of the Website that were previously of interest to you. If you previously provided personal data, then cookies may enable the automatic completion of your name and other information when, for example, you complete an online form.
  * Cookies also enable the University to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics to help understand how the Website is used, and so how to make improvements. It is not possible for cookies to read personal information on your computer or to find out any personal information about you. You can refuse to accept cookies by modifying the settings in your browser, but this may limit the functionality of Webpages on, or your access to, the Website.
