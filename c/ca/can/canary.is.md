### 1\. Accepting the Privacy Policy

Our mission at Canary is to build products that empower people to live fearless lives and make decisions about their safety and security. We believe that providing transparency around the data and personal information you entrust to us is critical to complete that mission. Your privacy and trust are our utmost concern. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes how we collect and use personal and other information through our home security device, mobile applications, and web applications (our "Products" or "Services") and from visitors to our website [https://canary.is](https://web.archive.org/) (the "Site"). This Policy describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information, how we share your information, and how you can access and update your information.

If you are a resident of the US or Canada, these terms are an agreement between you and Canary Connect, Inc. Otherwise, these terms are an agreement between you and Canary Technology Europe, Limited. In these terms, references to "Canary" "us", "we" and "our" mean either Canary Connect, Inc. or Canary Technology Europe Limited, as appropriate.

By visiting the Site or using our Products you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy. Any additional terms, conditions, or policies referenced or available by hyperlink at [https://www.canary.is/legal](https://web.archive.org/legal/) are incorporated by reference into this Policy.

### 2\. Information Canary Collects

We collect the following personal and device information when visiting our Site or using our Product:

 **Personal & Account Information**

  * Information you provide during device setup, such as your name, email address, phone number, the location of each device, and the number of people in your home.
  * Information necessary to complete a purchase from our Site, including your name, billing and shipping address, credit card information, and other information necessary to complete your transaction, as well as any other information that you choose to provide to us when making a purchase.
  * If you are invited to create an account from the owner of a Canary product we will collect your name and email address from the Canary user that invited you. Your phone number and other account details will be obtained directly from you during the setup process, provided that you accept the invitation.
  * Unique identifiers such as your user name and password.



 **Device Information**

  * Audio and video is collected through the device. Audio and video data is stored securely on our servers to ensure you can access it and playback footage.
  * Environmental data from Canary’s sensors, such as air quality, humidity, temperature, and ambient light.
  * Device Information, such as model and serial number, the Canary’s network information (including IP address), device activity logs, and historic and current device configuration.
  * Information about your mobile device such as your mobile device ID (which is similar to a website IP address), device type, operating system, and mobile service carrier as well as your location if you activate automatic mode switching.



### 3\. How Canary Uses Your Information

We collect the information identified above and use it for the following purposes:

  * Provide you user services and improve the Canary Product functionality and user experience.
  * To fulfill orders and process payments for the sale of Products or Services from our Site.
  * Administer your account and back-up your data.
  * Record log entries for your information and troubleshooting issues with your device.
  * Send you notifications through the Canary app. You can manage your
preferences within the mobile app settings.
  * Send you marketing communications, where permitted by applicable law.
  * To conduct research and analysis to better understand how users access and use our Site and Products, both on an aggregated and individualized basis, in order to improve our Site, our Products, create new features, provide you new offerings, respond to user preferences, and to protect your data.
  * Respond to your questions and concerns and provide customer support.



#### 4\. Choices You Have to Limit Information Collection

 **Location Services**   
Some features of our app use location-based data. If you allow these services, we will use information about the Wi-Fi routers and cell IDs of the towers closest to you. We use this information to facilitate the device’s automatic mode switching, for customer support related to our Products, and to provide you with local emergency service contact information. You may disable location services within your phone’s settings menu.

 **Video & Audio**   
You may configure your Canary device from within the mobile application to capture video and audio of your location within the camera’s range and provide you with notifications. You can set your Canary device to different modes from within the mobile app menu. Each mode determines when Canary records audio and video and when you receive notifications and can be customized depending on your settings. You should inform guests of any recording if the camera is on while others are in your home.

You may enable privacy mode or disable recording from within the app menu to prevent the recording of video and audio through the device. In privacy mode, the watch live video feature and event notifications are disabled and the camera and microphone are turned off. Your device will continue to monitor environmental activity in privacy mode so we may provide you with aggregated HomeHealth information. LED lights on the bottom of the device will be turned off to indicate the device is in privacy mode.

### 5\. How Canary Shares Your Information

We will share certain categories of your information with third parties only in certain circumstances as described below:

 **Identifiable Information.**   
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that contains data that could be used to directly or indirectly identify you, like your name or email address. We only share this information under extremely limited circumstances. Primarily, this information is shared with third parties to provide you necessary Services or to operate your Canary device. For example, this information is shared on a limited basis to assist in managing the computers that store your personal and device information and to third parties that assist us in providing you with customer support. These third parties are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

Specifically, we may share this information as follows:

  *  **Affiliates.** We may disclose the information we collect from you to our affiliates and subsidiaries that provide services or conduct data processing on our behalf, or for data centralization and / or logistics purposes. If we do so, their use and disclosure of your personal information will be subject to this Policy.
  *  **Service Providers.** We may disclose the information we collect from you to third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform functions on our behalf (e.g., with vendors that help us with delivering products to you, vendors that help us maintain our Site, or analytics providers).
  *  **Business Transfers.** If we are acquired by or merged with another company, or if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, we may transfer the information we have collected from you to the other company.
  *  **In Response to Legal Process.** We also may disclose the information we collect from you in order to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena. To the extent legally allowed, we will notify you of such requests prior to disclosing any information sought.
  *  **To Protect Us and Others.** We also may disclose the information we collect from you where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service or this Policy.



### Anonymized Information

We may share your aggregated and de-identified information, which is anonymized and does not identify you.

We may also share this anonymized information with third parties for marketing, advertising, research, or similar purposes.

We may share personally identifiable information with third parties provided we receive your consent to share that information. For example, you may opt to share certain information so it can be posted on your social media accounts like Facebook or Twitter, you may link your Canary account with another app or Service, or you may opt into providing information to Canary’s business partners to receive special offers. Information will never be shared for these purposes without your consent. We never share your audio or video information with any third party for business or marketing purposes.

### Information Obtained from Third Parties

If you provide personal information about others or if others provide us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.
