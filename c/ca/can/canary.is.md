This Policy describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information, how we share your information, and how you can access and update your information.

If you are a resident of the US or Canada, these terms are an agreement between you and Canary Connect, Inc. Otherwise, these terms are an agreement between you and Canary Technology Europe Limited. In these terms, references to "Canary" "us", "we" and "our" mean either Canary Connect, Inc. or Canary Technology Europe Limited, as appropriate.

By visiting the Site or using our Products you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy. Any additional terms, conditions, or policies referenced or available by hyperlink at [https://www.canary.is/legal](https://web.archive.org/legal/) are incorporated by reference into this Policy.

###### What Information Does Canary Collect?

We collect the following personal and device information when visiting our Site or using our Product:

Your phone number and other account details will be obtained directly from you during the setup process, provided that you accept the invitation.
  * Unique identifiers such as your user name and password.



 **Device Information**

  * Audio and video is collected through the device. Audio and video data is stored securely on our servers to ensure you can access it and playback footage.
  * Environmental data from Canary’s sensors, such as air quality, humidity, temperature, and ambient light.
  * Device Information, such as model and serial number, the Canary’s network information (including IP address), device activity logs, and historic and current device configuration.
  * Information about your mobile device such as your mobile device ID (which is similar to a website IP address), device type, operating system, and mobile service carrier as well as your location if you activate automatic mode switching.



###### What Does Canary Use My Information For?

We collect the information identified above and use it for the following purposes:

  * Provide you user services and improve the Canary Product functionality and user experience.
  * To fulfill orders and process payments for the sale of Products or Services from our Site.
  * Administer your account and back-up your data.
  * Record log entries for your information and troubleshooting issues with your device.
  * Send you notifications through the Canary app. You can manage your notification preferences within the mobile app menu.
  * Send you marketing communications, where permitted by applicable law.
  * To conduct research and analysis to better understand how users access and use our Site and Products, both on an aggregated and individualized basis, in order to improve our Site, our Products, create new features, provide you new offerings, respond to user preferences, and to protect your data.
  * Respond to your questions and concerns and provide customer support.



#### What are my Choices?

 **Location Services**   
Some features of our app use location-based data. If you allow these services, we will use information about the Wi-Fi routers and cell IDs of the towers closest to you. We use this information to facilitate the device’s automatic mode switching, for customer support related to our Products, and to provide you with local emergency service contact information. You may disable location services within your phone’s settings menu.

 **Video & Audio**   
You may configure your Canary device from within the mobile application to capture video and audio of your location within the camera’s range and provide you with notifications. You can set your Canary device to different modes from within the mobile app menu. Each mode determines when Canary records audio and video and when you receive notifications and can be customized depending on your settings. You should inform guests of any recording if the camera is on while others are in your home.

You may enable privacy mode from within the app menu to prevent the recording of video and audio through the device. In privacy mode, the watch live video feature and event notifications are disabled and the camera and microphone are turned off. Your device will continue to monitor environmental activity in privacy mode so we may provide you with aggregated HomeHealth information. LED lights on the bottom of the device will be turned off to indicate the device is in privacy mode.
