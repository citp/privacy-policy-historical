**Our Company**  
Canada Drug Pharmacy is about making quality medication accessible and better health possible. We are an online company that is based in Canada with an international network of fulfillment centers. Prices on the same medication vary between countries because they are set by the government of each individual country. Since prices of branded and generic version medicines are often cheaper in Canada and other countries, an online pharmacy company such as Canada Drug Pharmacy is able to always source from the location with the best prices. Read below for more details on [our company](http://www.canadadrugpharmacy.com/ourcompany.asp), timeframes for [shipping orders](http://www.canadadrugpharmacy.com/content/our-company/shipping.asp), and [privacy laws](http://www.canadadrugpharmacy.com/content/our-company/privacy.asp) that protect your information.
