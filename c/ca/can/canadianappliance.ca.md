The personal information that you provide in the course of your relationship with us is collected for the purpose of providing you the requested services. Your personal information will not be used for any other purpose, except with your consent, or as required by law.

We take appropriate security and other measures to preserve the confidentiality of your personal information and to ensure that it is used for the intended purposes. We will only retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the fulfillment of purpose(s) for which the information was provided. In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, or if we sell a part of our business, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the personal information that we have collected from you as part of such merger, sale or other change of control. If you wish to obtain access to your personal information, please contact us at the address, phone number or email listed above.

Our Privacy Commitment

At Canadian Appliance Source we know how important it is to protect your personal information. Whether you are shopping with us online or in person we want to make every customer experience safe and secure. In keeping with that goal, we have developed this Privacy Policy to explain our practices for the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.

  
This Policy applies to our retail stores, our Web Sites, and all other channels in which Canadian Appliance Source collects and uses your personal information.

What Information does Canadian Appliance Source Collect?

At Canadian Appliance Source, we collect two types of information: personal information and non-personal information. The types of information we collect depend on the nature of your interaction with us.

  
Personal information

· Personal information is information that can identify an individual or information about an identifiable individual. We may collect personal information such as:

· your contact information – e.g., name, postal address, telephone number, and email address;

· your personal preferences – e.g., product wish lists, language preferences, and marketing consent; and

· your transaction information – e.g., products purchased, method of payment, amount paid, and credit or debit card number.

  
Non-personal information

· Non-personal information does not identify you as an individual. For example:

· we may ask you for your postal code to assist us with planning our flyer distribution;

· we may collect certain non-personal data when you visit our Web Sites, such as the type of browser you are using or the referring URL; or

· we may collect and summarize customer information in a non-personal, aggregate format for statistical and research purposes. We may, for example, summarize our data to determine that a certain percentage of contest entrants are male, aged 18 to 25.

  
All references to “Web Sites” in this Privacy Policy mean [www.CanadianAppliance.ca](http://www.canadianappliance.ca/),, or other Canadian Appliance Source provided Web sites.

  
You may choose not to provide us with your personal information. However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information that you requested. For example, we can only offer you a Canadian Appliance Source credit card if you have provided us with certain financial information.
