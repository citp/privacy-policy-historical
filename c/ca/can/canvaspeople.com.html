<p><strong>OUR POLICY</strong><br>
We do not collect personally identifiable information from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly at CanvasPeople.com. If you are simply browsing our website and learning about our products, we invite you to do so. As an unregistered visitor to our site, we'll recognize your home server (e.g., that your web access is through AOL.com), but not your e-mail address or any other personal or system information.</p>
<p>We send all of our canvas orders through the mail, so if you wish to order our products, it will be necessary for you to provide personally identifiable information. This includes your name, address, phone number and, if you place your order online, credit card information. Any personal information you provide is downloaded off of the web server to a secure system and is maintained there.</p>

<p><strong>OUR CUSTOMER LIST</strong><br>
When you purchase items from our website, your name will be added to our Customer List.

If you prefer not to receive these e-mail notifications, please follow the "Opt-out" instructions included with the e-mail or contact us at (e-mail address).</p>

<p><strong>COOKIES</strong><br>
Like most internet-based companies, we use "cookies" (small pieces of information stored on your computer) on certain parts of our website. These cookies allow us to manage your session. This ensures that we keep your order saved while you browse through the site and select items for purchase. We do not use the cookie to collect any type of personal information, and the cookie doesn't extract any information from your computer.</p>

<p><strong>SECURITY ONLINE<br>
</strong>Most of our forms, especially when ordering a product or using online customer service, use secure pages to insure that the information sent between your computer and our system is secure. This is especially true if we are asking you for payment information. </p>
