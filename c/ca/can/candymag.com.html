</p><ol>
  <li>When you register to become a Candymag.com member, we ask for your name, 
    email address, birth date, gender, civil status, contact nos and home address. 
    We also ask you to answer some simple questions about your lifestyle and personal 
    preferences, such as Internet usage and current educational status. We use 
    this information to create a profile of our members that will help us develop 
    our features and services. This profile will be presented as general demographics 
    in our media kit and other advertising materials. We do not sell, trade, or 
    rent your personal information to others. We only provide personal information 
    to sponsors if you specify your interest in receiving information from the 
    sponsors. <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>When you subscribe to any of our newsletters (Sweet Reminders, Contest Alerts 
    etc.), all we need is your email address, which is used to send your chosen 
    newsletter. <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>To create topics and post messages in TEENTalk, our message boards, you

    more information from the sponsor. You will receive such information only 
    if you choose to. </p>
  <li>We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about 
    important functionality changes to our website, new services, and special 
    offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this 
    information, visit your personal Member Profile page to change your preferences.

  We take special precautions in protecting the privacy our young readers. While

  teens who visit and use our website. We provide informative feature articles 
  on the subject of online safety and set up strict rules for the online community. 
  We never censor discussion on TEENtalk or in the chatrooms; however, we do monitor 
  them closely for offensive, abusive, and threatening messages. We also provide 
  contact informations (by telephone, fax, mail, and email) that are dedicated 
  to assisting and guiding our young members. </p>
  
<p>Before you go further into the Internet, we invite you to 
  read <a href="cybersafety.php" class="aboutuslinks">"CyberSafety"</a>, (a primer on protecting yourself on the Internet.) </p>
