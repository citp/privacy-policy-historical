# Privacy Policy - CancanIT

CancanIT has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to our visitors' and participants' privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: www.CancanIT.com. This Privacy Policy is a portion of, and is incorporated into, the Web Site Terms and Conditions of Use.

#### Non-Personal Information

During your visit to the Site, we may request non-personally identifiable demographic and profile data, though your provision of this information is optional. We may use this data to improve our Site and enhance your experience. For example, we may use this data to tailor your experience at our Site, show you content that we think you might be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. We may also share this information with others, such as advertisers interested in advertising on the CancanIT Site, in aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any other person.

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Site. Your IP address is used to help identify you for the duration of a session and to gather broad demographic information.

As you browse the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each Web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes called "clickstream" data, can be collected and stored by a Web site's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use, the address of the Web site from which you linked to the CancanIT Site, and in some instances, your e-mail address. We may use clickstream data to determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Site and how they navigate throughout the Site. We will only use this information to improve the CancanIT Site.

#### Personal Information

When registering at our Site as a Member, you may be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information about yourself, such as your name, company name, job title, e-mail address and certain information about your business and preferences. You may also be given the option of providing additional personal information such as your URL, phone and fax number and mailing address.

We use personal information provided by Members to notify Members about opportunities, deliver CancanIT newsletters and otherwise communicate with Members about CancanIT and its products and services. CancanIT will not share any personal information of Members with any unaffiliated third parties, without your consent.

As part of your use of the Services, you are responsible for maintaining and updating, as applicable, your Member Account information with current, accurate and complete information. You may do this, using your password and user name, by visiting the customer service portion of the CancanIT Site at "My Account" to make such changes.

#### Cookies

"Cookies" are pieces of information that are placed on an individual's computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the CancanIT Site. CancanIT may use cookies to customize your Site experience, to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly, to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password (in some cases) so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site, and for other purposes. However, you may disallow cookies through your Web browser and still visit our Site. CancanIT will never use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to the CancanIT Site or Services or your interaction with the CancanIT Site.

#### Supplemental Information

We may supplement the information that you provide to us with information that is received from third parties.

#### Security

We take seriously the security for all personal and non-personal information associated with our visitors and participants. However, due to the open communication nature of the Internet, we can not guarantee that communications between you and CancanIT, and CancanIT and you, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties.
