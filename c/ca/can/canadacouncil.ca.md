## Consent

What happens if you refuse to provide your information

The Canada Council collects your personal information in the ways described in this Privacy Notice and throughout its collection process. If you choose not to provide your information to us, we may not be able to:

  * assess your application, or nomination, deeming it ineligible;
  * respond to your request; or
  * award funds.



Without your consent to collect, use and disclose your personal information the Canada Council is unable to provide you with information or services.

By choosing to provide personal information to the Canada Council or by using this website, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure, retention, management and processing of your personal information for the purposes explained in an application process of a program or as explained in this Privacy Notice. Please ensure that all information that you provide is true, accurate and complete.

Wherever possible, we seek a person’s consent before we collect their personal information. The form of consent may vary depending on the circumstances and the type of information being requested. Consent can be express or implied, and can be provided directly by the individual or by an authorized representative.

We will not use your personal information without your consent unless it is either:

  * for the same purpose for which the information was originally collected or compiled;
  * consistent with that purpose; or
  * for a purpose that may be disclosed under section 8(2) of the _Privacy Act_.



## How do we protect your personal information

The Canada Council uses well-established technology to protect the security of your online personal information and your personal content through appropriate administrative, technical and physical security measures and safeguards.  The Canada Council follows industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.

The level of safeguards used to protect personal information will depend on the:

  * sensitivity of the personal information;
  * amount, distribution and format of the information; and
  * method of storage.



The Canada Council follows the [Policy on Government Security](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16578) and any other federal direction or guidance on information technology security.

The Canada Council employs methods of protection that include:

  * employee training on privacy and the protection of personal information;
  * granting access to information on a “need-to-know” basis;
  * technical measures such as passwords, audit trails, encryption, firewalls and other technical security safeguards;
  * online portal encryption using secure socket layer technology (an SSL certificate), protecting passwords and profile information; users should look for this cue when entering sensitive personal information;
  * physical measures such as locked filing cabinets, restricted access to our offices and other areas where personal information is stored;
  * as part of the peer assessment process, all peer committee members are advised of Council’s expectations for confidentiality and must sign a non-disclosure form;
  * employees are required to sign non-disclosure forms;


  * all individuals or organizations hired under contract or other means to conduct business on behalf of the Canada Council are required to respect the provisions of the _Privacy Act_ as well as this Privacy Notice and related internal policies; and



Personal information may be shared with appropriate law enforcement authorities if suspected criminal activities are detected.

While we are committed to maintaining the security of your information, you play an important role in helping us meet this obligation. Never reveal your username, password or authentication question to anyone.

**Monitoring and evaluation**

Measuring compliance with this Privacy Notice is part of the Canada Council’s internal reviews.

**Privacy Breach**

A privacy breach is the loss of, unauthorized access to, or disclosure of personal information. This may be result of theft, loss of information, data storage equipment, improper or unauthorized collection, use, disclosure, access, storage or disposal of information, including misdirected correspondence.  When the Canada Council discovers or is made aware of a breach, immediate action is taken in compliance with the [Government of Canada’s Directive on Privacy Practices](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18309) and the [Guidelines for Privacy Breaches](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26154).

## Retention and destruction of your personal information

Personal information is retained in accordance with federal legislative requirements, such as the[ Library and Archives Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/L-7.7/index.html) (s. 7d, 12) and the _Privacy Act_ (s. 4; 5; 6). Following the recommended timeframe, the information is disposed of in accordance with the _Library and Archives Act_ (s. 9; 12).

The Canada Council's retention & disposition guidelines are intended to ensure that records are available for decision-making and are then either stored for historical purposes or disposed of after legal and operational obligations have been met. The retention, disposition and destruction of personal information, is made in accordance with the [Government of Canada’s Directive on Privacy Practices](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18309).
