[Click here](http://rogersmagazines.com/mediasites/index.html) to see a list of all Rogers Media Web sites.

_How can I learn more about your official privacy policy?_  
The official privacy policy commitment of our parent company, Rogers Communications Inc., can be found below in the Commitment to Privacy. A printed version can be requested. (see "Contact Us" below)

_What is personal information?_  
Personal information is any information that is related to you as an identifiable individual. It typically includes such information as your name, e-mail address, or mailing address. It could also include preferences you provided at web sites or other information.

_Does Rogers collect personal information?_  
We retain only information you provide voluntarily. We will ask for your name, address, e-mail address, or other personal information when you register with a web site or order a product or service. You may also be asked for personal information when you enter into contests or promotions sponsored by us or our partners.

_How does Rogers use information it gathers about me?_  
Rogers collects and uses your name, e-mail address and other personal information to provide you with a product or service that you requested. We may further use such information to develop and customize products or services to better meet your needs and preferences, and to offer you products and services from Rogers, including any companies within the Rogers group of companies.

_Might I be contacted by organizations outside Rogers?_  
Advertisers who use direct mail may ask Rogers Publishing to be able to send through the mail material of interest to subscribers of some of our publications, but in such cases the list is only released to a reputable third party service bureau for the purpose of sending the specific mailing. E-mail lists might be used for similar communications. All such advertising material is reviewed and subject to approval for acceptable advertising content.  
If you would prefer that you name not be provided to marketers outside of Rogers, please inform us. (see "Contact Us" below)

_What are marketing preferences?_  
In general, we assume that your relationship with Rogers Media permits us to contact you about our products and services, as well as those of our sister companies in the Rogers Group of Companies. But if you prefer otherwise, we provide clear, easy ways for you to tell us so. These are your personal marketing preferences.

_How can I change my marketing preferences?_  
You can contact a customer service representative of the Rogers Media property you receive material from, or use their online customer care (if available for that property). If you registered with a password-protected profile at one of our web sites, log in to your profile update page and click the "Update Your Rogers Marketing Preferences" link at the bottom of the page. If you do not have a password-protected profile, you will have to upgrade your newsletter registration. Do this by registering for a password-protected profile with your existing e-mail address, and clicking on the upgrade link when prompted. If you prefer not to register with a password, you can remove yourself from all future marketing e-mail communications by clicking the link found at the end of any marketing e-mail.

_Are there other ways my information will be used?_  
In addition to the cases above, Rogers may use your personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, under circumstances specifically described to you when we collect the information (such as in a Terms of Service or Use agreement), or in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions. 

_What about personalized ads in magazines?_  
Occasionally an advertiser may ask that we print the name of subscribers in their advertisement in our publications. When this is done, the subscriber's name is printed on the ad at the same time that the mailing label is printed on the cover of the magazine, and the subscriber's name appears only in their personal copy of the magazine. If you would prefer not have your name included in such advertisements, please contact us at Magazine Subscriber Service and specify 'Do Not Personalize'.

_Does Rogers protect the privacy of children?_  
The privacy of children is important to us. We will not knowingly send direct mailings, e-mail or other correspondence to anyone who indicates that they are younger than 16 years. Your children should always ask you for permission before sending personal information to Rogers Communications Inc., or to anyone else. Any personal information we gather from children under the age of 16 would be used solely for demographic purposes.

Every time we send out one of our newsletters, we include an "unsubscribe" link. Simply click on this link and follow the instructions. You will be automatically removed from that newsletter distribution list. 

_Can I change or update my e-mail newsletter subscriptions?_  
We have many e-mail newsletters for you choose from and realize your preferences may change over time. If you provided a password when you subscribed, just log on - using your e-mail address and your password - and you'll be brought to your profile page. All your choices are listed here. Simply click on the options provided, and then "Update Profile." If you prefer not to register with a password, you can remove yourself from all future marketing e-mail communications by clicking the link found at the end of any marketing e-mail.

_Can I change my e-mail marketing preferences online?_   
If you registered with a password-protected profile at one of our web sites, log in to your profile update page and click the "Update Your Rogers Marketing Preferences" link at the bottom of the page. If you do not have a password-protected profile, you can upgrade your newsletter registration. Do this by registering for a password-protected profile with your existing e-mail address, and clicking on the upgrade link when prompted. If you prefer not to upgrade, you can click the link to no longer receive marketing messages at the end of any marketing e-mail.

_I'm registering on one of your sites for the first time, but my name is here already. How?_  
Virtually all [Rogers Media Web sites](http://rogersmagazines.com/mediasites/index.html) will begin using a shared web registration service in 2006. Any information you provide at registration for a site is tied to your e-mail address. If you use the same e-mail address to register at another Rogers Media Web site, the associated information will be retrieved, so you don't have to re-enter it.

_Do Rogers web sites use cookies?_  
Yes, some Rogers web sites use cookies. Typically, a cookie is set when you register on our sites.   
A cookie is a small text file sent to your browser's files for our reference. No one else can read this file. Cookies allow our server computer to recognize you when you return to our sites, so you don't have to re-register and so we can retain any preferences you may have given us. If you do not wish to receive cookies, most browsers allow you to be alerted when a cookie is sent to your computer, so you can decide whether to accept it.

_Do Rogers websites record information about my computer or my visit?_  
Rogers collects IP addresses and related information for the purposes of system administration and to create aggregate statistical reports for advertisers. This information cannot identify you personally.  
Browser information (i.e. the URL of the web page you were just on, the IP address of the computer you are using, your domain type, and your browser version) is automatically recorded as part of transmitting information over the Internet. We may use it to help us display information in the best format for you.   
We may develop summary reports for advertisers, to help them better understand our audience and provide advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you. For example, we may report total number of visitors to our site in general or to specific pages, average length of visit, etc. No identifying data about individuals is reported.   
During your visit to our sites, we may record choices you have made and use this to provide more customized content or advertising. The data does not identify you and is not retained after your visit. This is sometimes called "clickstream" data.

_Does Rogers use "third party advertising"?_  
The ads appearing on many of our Web sites are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visits to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you. For more information about DoubleClick, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please click here - <http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy>. 

_What about information on public forums?_  
Rogers sites may make chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

_What steps do you take for the security of my information?_   
Our sites use industry-standard security measures to protect data against loss, misuse and interception by third parties. Our security policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. However, Rogers assumes no liability for interception, alteration or misuse of information transmitted over the Internet.

_How else can I protect my privacy online?_  
Generally speaking, whenever you disclose personal information online there is a risk that the information may be intercepted, collected and used. That goes for information disclosed on message boards, in chat areas \- or even in e-mail. Rogers is not responsible if that information is intercepted. You transmit information to anyone at your own risk. 

Co-branded sites and third party Internet sites and services may be accessible through Rogers sites. Third parties may collect information for their own contests or promotions, and may have their own privacy and data collection practices. Rogers is not responsible for and bears no liability for these policies or actions.   
You alone are responsible for keeping passwords and information safe. Be careful and responsible whenever you're online.

_What happens to information I provide on a contest entry?_  
Rogers uses a variety of contests and similar promotions to increase awareness of our products and services. We generally request contact information so that we can notify you if you are a prize winner. As well, in some cases we may contact contest entrants with product information. Contest entries generally include a way for you to indicate that you do not want to be contacted based on the information on your entry. Because contests may involve co-sponsors outside Rogers who have their own privacy practices, it is always advisable to read the entry form and contest rules before entering.
