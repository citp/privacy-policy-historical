We use this information only to send the communication you requested and to monitor the effectiveness of our tell-a-friend features. As part of the standard operation of the Site, we may collect certain non-personal information from you, including but not limited to your browser type, operating system, IP address and the domain name from which you accessed the Site. In addition, we may collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you visit the Site, the areas or pages of the Site that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing the Site, the number of times you return to the Site and other click-stream data. We do not combine this non-personal information with your personal information. We use this information to: (1) provide you with customized content and advertising; (2) administer the Site, monitor its usage and diagnose problems with it; (3) remember you when you return to the Site, so that you don’t have to re-submit information and preferences; and (4) conduct research to improve our content and services.

We also work with a company that serves advertisements on our behalf. The company uses cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to collect anonymous information about your visits to the Site and other websites, so that we may serve you advertisements that are relevant to your interests. Our ad serving company does not collect personal information about you, and we do not share any personal information with it. We will never share your IP address with a third party (except for our service providers) without first securing your express permission to do so.
