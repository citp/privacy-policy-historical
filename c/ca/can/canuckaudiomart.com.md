**The kind of security precautions that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information**

Other than the administrator of the Canuck Audio Mart or other authorized personnel of the Canuck Audio Mart, you are the only person who has access to your personal information. Your ads are password-protected to prevent unauthorized access. 

We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Canuck Audio Mart will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Canuck Audio Mart cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

**What else you should know about your online privacy**

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example in ads that you post or through email - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
