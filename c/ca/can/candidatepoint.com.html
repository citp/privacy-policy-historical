					<h2>Cookies</h2>
					<p>Cookies are small data files that most websites store, access and maintain on the hard drive of users’ computers. Cookies generally contain a unique identification code for the computer or, if associated with a registration, a particular user, which is keyed to data stored on the site operator’s server about the user’s use of the website. This enables the website to recognize the computer or user each time he returns to the website. Most browsers now automatically accept cookies by default, by they can be set so that all or some cookies are rejected automatically, or are accepted or rejected on a case-by-case basis at the user’s option.</p>
					<p>We may use cookies to keep track of your session and advertising delivery. We, or our partners, may also use these cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save a password associated with your user profile. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our site. These companies may use third-party cookies to record information (excluding your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you on others websites.</p>

Your use of external websites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies located on the external websites.</p>
					<h2>Assignment</h2>
					<p>If there is a change of control in our business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise) or if there is an asset sale, the user information, including personal information, could be sold as part of that transaction and your personally identifying information potentially could be used by the purchaser. However, if that business materially changes this statement or the information handling practices as described in this Privacy Policy, you will be notified by email and/or through a notice posted on the site, and you may opt-out of the use of your existing information in a new manner.
