<h2 id="cookie">Cookies</h2>
<p>
Cookies are small data files that most websites store, access and maintain on the hard drive of users’ computers. Cookies generally
contain a unique identification code for the computer or, if associated with a registration, a particular user, which is keyed to
data stored on the site operator’s server about the user’s use of the website. This enables the website to recognize the computer
or user each time he returns to the website. Most browsers now automatically accept cookies by default, by they can be set so that
all or some cookies are rejected automatically, or are accepted or rejected on a case-by-case basis at the user’s option.
</p>
<p>
We may use cookies to keep track of your session and advertising delivery. We, or our partners, may also use these cookies to
deliver content specific to your interests and to save a password associated with your user profile. We use third-party advertising
companies to serve ads when you visit our site. These companies may use third-party cookies to record information (excluding your

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>
If there is a change of control in our business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise) or if there is an asset sale, the user
information, including personal information, could be sold as part of that transaction and your personally identifying information
potentially could be used by the purchaser. However, if that business materially changes this statement or the information handling
practices as described in this Privacy Policy, you will be notified by email and/or through a notice posted on the site, and you
