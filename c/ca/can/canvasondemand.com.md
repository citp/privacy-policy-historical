**_How We Collect and Use Your Information_**

**Personal Information.** We use Personal Information primarily for internal business purposes, such as providing, maintaining, evaluating and improving the Website and the services offered through the Website, fulfilling requests for information, producing and shipping the products that you order, and providing customer support. For example, if you create an account with us, we will use the information that you provide us to communicate with you. Similarly, if you sign up to subscribe to a newsletter, we will use the email address you provide to send you the newsletters. Circle Graphics may use your Personal Information for targeted marketing and customer analysis by linking your information with third-party demographic and household data to provide a more personalized service.

**Google Analytics**. We use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Website. Google Analytics uses "cookies," which are text files placed on your computer, to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website (including IP address) is transmitted to Google. This information is then used to evaluate visitors' use of the Website and to compile statistical reports on Website activity for Circle Graphics. For more information regarding how Google Analytics protects your data, please visit Google's website at www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html.

**Cookies**. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is stored on your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that website to recognize your browser. Cookies may store unique identifiers, user preferences, and other information. When you visit our Website we store one or more "cookies" on your computer. You can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. We use cookies to improve the quality of the Website and services, including to store user preferences, to track user trends, and to provide relevant advertising to you.

**Pixel Tags**. We may use "pixel tags," also known as "web beacons," which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of the Website. A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on websites, or when emails are opened or accessed, and is often used in combination with cookies. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.

**Subproccesors**. Circle Graphics uses data subprocessors to assist in providing its payment processing, analytics, storage, and advertising. A complete list of subprocessors Circle Graphics currently uses can be requested by emailing privacy@circlegraphicsonline.com.

**Disclosure to Unaffiliated Third Parties.** We may disclose your Personal Information to respond to legal requirements, to protect or enforce our rights and policies, to protect or enforce the rights of a third party, and to prevent harm to a person or as required or permitted by law (including, without limitation, to comply with a subpoena or court order).

**Disclosure to Third Party Service Providers and Online Partners**. We may contract with various third parties who help us provide, maintain, and improve the Website and the services. For example, we use a third party to process payments made to us, and may subcontract out production, fulfillment, analytics, reporting or other operations. We also contract with several online partners to help manage, monitor, and optimize our Website, and to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising, communications, and how visitors use the Website.

**Disclosure of Non-Personal Information**. We may disclose your de-identified information, in aggregate form, to potential strategic partners, advertisers, investors, customers, and others.

**Internet Advertising**. We may use third party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on the Website. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Website, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services.

**Disclosure to Successors**. If we sell our business or one of our brands, we may transfer or sell your Personal Information to the new owner. In such a case, unless permitted otherwise by applicable law, your information would remain subject to the promises made in the applicable privacy policy unless you agree differently.

**Your Consent**. In addition to the sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may share Personal Information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Circle Graphics if we obtain your consent to do so.

**_Legal Basis For Collecting Your Information_**

Circle Graphics collects and processes your data to provide the products and services you have requested or purchased, and to monitor, evaluate, and improve our business and the products and services we provide. We use your Personal Information to communicate with you concerning products and services you have requested or purchased, as well as other products and services we offer that you may be interested in.

Your Personal Information is stored by Circle Graphics on its servers, and on the servers of the cloud-based database management services it engages, located in the United States. Circle Graphics retains data for the duration of the customer's business relationship with Circle Graphics, for the purposes indicated in this Privacy Policy, or for such other period as may be permitted or required by law, whichever is longest.

**_How We Protect Your Personal Information_**

**Personal Information**. We use industry standard physical, technical, and administrative security measures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information. When you enter sensitive information such as a credit card number on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using Transport Layer Security ("TLS") technology. However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us.

**Website Content**. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your account and login information. Please note that content that you store or transmit through the Website or services, or e-mails and other communications you send to us, are not encrypted. You should not assume that your content will be kept private, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means.

**_Making Changes To Your Personal Information_**

If you have questions about your Personal Information or need to update it, you can email us at privacy@circlegraphicsonline.com, or call us at (800) 557-2520. If you close your account, we will no longer use your online account information or share it with third parties. We may, however, retain a copy of the information for archival purposes and to avoid identity theft or fraud and for other legitimate business purposes. You can opt-out of receiving marketing or promotional e-mails from Circle Graphics by going to the account management section of the Website, or by using the opt-out or unsubscribe feature contained in the marketing or promotional e-mails.

We also provide you the opportunity to opt-out of having your information used for certain purposes. For example, if you purchase a product but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.

You may be able to access third party websites directly from the Website. This Privacy Policy does not apply when you access third party websites. We cannot control how third parties may use any information you disclose to them, so you should carefully review the privacy policy of any third party website you visit before using it or disclosing your information to its provider.

If we disclose your information to a third party in a manner that is not set forth in this Privacy Policy, you will be notified so that you can make an informed choice about sharing your information with that third party.

Under California's "Shine the Light" law, California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family, or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us once a calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g. requests made in 2018 will receive information regarding 2017 sharing activities).

To obtain this information, please send an email message to privacy@circlegraphicsonline.com with "Request for California Privacy Information" on the subject line and in the body of your message. We will provide the requested information to you at your e-mail address in response. Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the "Shine the Light" requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.
