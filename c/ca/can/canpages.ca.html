			I. VISITORS TO OUR WEBSITE:
		</h1>
		<div style="margin-top:15px; margin-left:20px;">
			<div>
				1. When you visit our web site, our web server will log information about you as a visitor that is not personally identifiable. For example, it may record the type of Internet Browser you are using, your computer operating system, and the domain name of the Web site from which you linked to our site.
				<br>
				<br>
			</div>
			<div>
				2. Also, we may collect data from you in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information. This information is used and analyzed to help us: understand trends and patterns; improve the content and design of the Canpages website; and to enable our audit bureau to verify our claims of traffic to the site; and to help advertisers and potential advertisers to assess the suitability of our site for their advertisements.  The information we receive in this manner is not personal information about an identifiable individual.
				<br>
				<br>
			</div>
			<div>
				3. Users who wish to use our enhanced or personalized services may be required to provide additional information. By voluntarily providing more personal information you allow us to increase the value of your experience on our site. Canpages.ca will use the data collectively for its own statistical analyses of its services. Canpages.ca may also ask users to complete surveys for research purposes only. All demographic and behavioural research is compiled on an aggregated basis and would only be shared in aggregate form to interested third parties.
				<br>
				<br>
			</div>
			<div>
				4. By providing an e-mail address, a user may from time to time receive communications from Canpages.ca on its new products and services or special offers that may be of interest. You can always opt out at the time of registration or at any time by telling us if you don't want to receive any e-mail communications from Canpages.ca.
				<br>
				<br>
			</div>
			<div>
				5. In providing Canpages Street Scene Service, Canpages has been sensitive to avoid including photographic information which would provide personal information about identifiable individuals. We are sensitive to the privacy concerns that might be raised by individuals who were photographed during the preparation of the data required by the Street Scene service. Photographs of identifiable individuals are in no way required by the service. The assembly of the data is designed to deliberately blur the faces of any individual who may be photographed in this process. You will notice as a result that no individual can be identified while using the Mapjack service. If you wish to report a privacy concern, please do so by clicking the "report a concern" on one the Street Scene Service Page.
				<br>
				<br>
			</div>
			<div>
				6. Canpages.ca reserves the right to change its policy at any time by notifying users of the existence of a new privacy statement. This statement does not create any contractual rights on behalf of any party.

				7. Cookies
			</div>
			<div style="margin-left:15px;">
				<div>
					Canpages.ca uses Cookies to track user patterns on its web site. Canpages.ca is taking advantage of cookies to enhance its services to users.
					<br>
					<br>
				</div>
				<div>
					<b>a) What is a Cookie?</b>
					<br>
				</div>
				<div style="margin-left:15px;">
					<span>Web servers are able to store small text information on web browsers. This information is called a Cookie. Cookies are basically used to keep track of user navigation and status on a web site. Also Cookies help web sites that provide personalized services to identify their users and display appropriate information to each registered user.</span>
					<br>
					<br>
				</div>
				<div>
					<b>b) Where does Canpages.ca use a Cookie?</b>
					<br>
				</div>
				<div style="margin-left:15px;">
					Canpages.ca uses Cookies to track user patterns on its web site. Canpages.ca is taking advantage of cookies to enhance its services to users.
					<br>
					<br>
				</div>
				<div>
					<b>c) How safe is using a Cookie?</b>
					<br>
				</div>
				<div style="margin-left:15px;">
					Because the Cookie information is a text value, there is no need to be worried about possible damage to your computer's software and data. No virus or executable code will be set on your computer as a result of setting a Cookie. Cookie sizes are limited so they won't take a lot of space.
					<br>
					<br>
				</div>
				<div>
					<b>d) Who can see my Cookies?</b>
					<br>
				</div>
				<div style="margin-left:15px;">
					Essentially the web site that you visit sets the Cookie on your browser and will be referring to it later. But this is not a hidden information to the Internet world. That is the reason why Cookie values are scrambled and encrypted so the text value will not be too obvious for public. The cookie value set by Canpages.ca on your computer is meaningful only to this web site.
					<br>
					<br>
				</div>
				<div>
					<b>e) How long will the Cookie stay on my computer?</b>
					<br>
				</div>
				<div style="margin-left:15px;">
					Some Cookie values are erased when you close your browser and some remain for future usage. Canpages.ca sets both types of cookies on your computer. The user identification Cookie will remain until the user signs off and clears it from their computer.
					<br>
					<br>
				</div>
				<div>
					<b>f) Hints on using Cookies on Canpages.ca</b>
					<br>
				</div>
				<div style="margin-left:15px;">
					Canpages.ca is using Cookies to identify registered users in order to streamline their personalized services. Without a Cookie, personalized services will not operate. Therefore users must enable their browsers to use Cookies. The identification of a user name is set as a Cookie in the registration phase. This ID will remain on that computer until it's removed and cleared by the user. Therefore any individual may use your computer to access your personalized services. Canpages.ca overcomes this issue by asking the user to enter in their password even though the user identification is understood from the Cookie value. Your identification Cookie is stored on all computers where you have entered your user name and password. When using another computer where you have never accessed your account before you will need to enter your user name and password because the identification Cookie was not set on that specific computer.
