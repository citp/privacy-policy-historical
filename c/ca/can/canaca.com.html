                                   <p>Because we gather certain types of   information about our members, we feel you should fully understand our   policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of   that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we   gather and how we use it.                                   </p>
                                   <p><strong>INFORMATION Canaca GATHERS AND TRACKS</strong>                                   </p>
                                   <p>Canaca gathers two types of information about   users:                                   </p>
                                   <p> * Information that users provide through   optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to   receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards   or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in polls and   surveys or to order any service:                                   </p>
                                   <p> * Information Canaca gathers through   aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views   throughout our sites. Under no circumstances does Canaca divulge any   information about an individual user to a third party except to it's   sister company Acanac Inc. .                                   </p>
                                   <p>Canaca-com Inc.  Gathers User Information In The   Following Processes:                                   </p>
                                   <p>Optional Voluntary Information                                   </p>
                                   <p>We offer the services, which require some   type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:</p>
                                   <p><br>
                                     <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>                                   </p>
                                   <p><strong>1. Electronic newsletters policy   (Dispatches)</strong>                                   </p>
                                   <p>We will offer a free electronic newsletter to   users. Canaca gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily   subscribe to our service.                                   </p>
                                   <p><strong>2. Message boards/forums policy</strong>                                   </p>
                                   <p>Users of the site's Message Boards and Forums   must register separately for these services (both are free of charge)   in order to post messages, although they needn't register to visit the   site. During registration the user is required to supply a username,   password, and email address.                                   </p>
                                   <p><strong>3. "E-mail this to a friend" policy</strong>                                   </p>
                                   <p>Our site users can choose to electronically   forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail   this to a friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as   that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of   transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent   the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.                                   </p>
                                   <p><strong>4. Polling</strong>                                   </p>
                                   <p>We may offer interactive polls to users so   they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our   audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to   polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user.   Canaca may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they   can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated   with information about individual users.                                   </p>
                                   <p><strong>5. Surveys</strong>                                   </p>
                                   <p>Canaca-com Inc. may occasionally conduct user surveys   to better target our services to our audience. We sometimes share the   aggregated demographic information in these surveys with Canaca-com Inc.   our sister company. We never share any of this information about   specific individuals with any other third party.                                   </p>
                                   <p><strong>Usage tracking</strong>                                   </p>
                                   <p>Canaca tracks user traffic patterns   throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this   information with data about individual users Canaca does break down   overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser   type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string   (information contained in every user's browser).                                   </p>
                                   <p>Canaca sometimes tracks and catalogs the   search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking   is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information   to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on   traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but   rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to   build a better service for you.                                   </p>
                                   <p><strong>Cookies</strong>                                   </p>
                                   <p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in   the browser files of your     computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information   although it will enable us to relate your     use of this site to information that you have specifically and   knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can   contain is information you supply your    self. A cookie can't read data off your     hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Canaca uses   cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our   advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad   impressions and click rates.</p>
                                   <p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in   your     browser. If you've set your     browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the   warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned   on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to participate   actively in message boards, forums, polling and surveys.                                   </p>
                                   <p>How the information you gather is used if   relevent.                                   </p>
                                   <p><strong>USE OF INFORMATION</strong>                                   </p>
                                   <p>Canaca uses any information voluntarily given   by our users to enhance their experience with our service, whether to   provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better   prepare future services.                                   </p>
                                   <p>As stated above, we use information that   users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters   and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards,   and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule   (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special   editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in   something we are doing. Canaca never shares newsletter mailing lists   with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners   except with Canaca-com Inc.                                   </p>
                                   <p>When we use tracking information to determine   which areas of our sites users like, and don't like based on traffic to   those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how   well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a   better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function   as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track   which terms a particular user enters.                                   </p>
                                   <p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
                                   <p>Canaca operates secure data networks   protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems.   Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and   enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the   information provided by our customers.                                   </p>
