Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. We recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better shopping experience. Utilities are available from third parties to help you visit websites anonymously, but use of such utilities may also prevent us from providing you with the best shopping experience at Candere.

 All personal information that we collect from our customers is used to improve our relevance to you and to improve your shopping experience with us.

 We use the information that you provide so that we may provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested. In addition, we may send you (via email or other means) offerings of products or services which we think may be of interest to you or we may ask you to participate in activities such as special surveys. At any time, you can choose to no longer receive any non-transactional emails from Candere by accessing http://www.candere.com/remove and entering the email address to which the email was originally addressed.

If we do share such personal information with a third party, we will, to the extent practical, require that the recipient protect that information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. However, we cannot guarantee how such a third party will use personal information.

 We sometimes use non-personally identifiable, summary or aggregate information that we collect to improve the design and content of our website and to enable us to further enhance your shopping experience with Candere. We may also share such aggregate information with third parties for that purpose.

 The personal information which you provide to Candere is an asset of the company and may be included in the assets transferred to an acquirer if Candere is acquired by a third party.
