**A Special Note About Children**

**NOTE TO PARENTS.** We are required under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), with limited exceptions, to obtain verifiable parantal consent in order to collect, use or disclose personal information from Children. COPPA allows the Child’s school, school districts and other educational institutions (collectively, **“SCHOOLS”** ) to obtain consent for the online collection of personal information from Children who are students of the School.

If a Child wants to use our Service, he/she must first obtain an account for our Services from the School ( **“Account”** ). Before an Account is provided to a School, we require that the School (on behalf of the Child’s parent or legal guardian ( **“PARENT”)** (a) to consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information of the Child, through the Service, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and (b) agree that the Child’s online activities are subject to our terms of service.

As required under COPPA, we allow Parents to make certain choices regarding the personal information submitted by their Children as described in this subsection. Parents should make any permitted requests with the School and have the School, as the Parent’s agent, pass on those requests to us. We may rely on the instructions that we receive from the School that we reasonably believe are given by a Child’s Parent to the School. For example, if a representative of the Child’s School contacts us and provides the Account information we request, we may assume that the person calling is acting on behalf of the Child’s Parent.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT, USE AND SHARE:** In general, we collect the same information from Children that collect from other users of the Services, and use and share such information for the same purposes. In addition, our Service also allows Schools to access and interact with their students and their Parents. If your Child’s School creates an Account for your Child, the School may share your Child’s personal information, such as your Child’s grades, test scores, attendance levels, and other information, with us. We may add all of this information to the information we have already collected from your Child via the Service, and we may use it as described in this Privacy Policy. We also may share your Child’s personal information: (a) with the Child’s Parent’s Consent, or with your Child’s School or those directed by your Child’s School We are not responsible for any errors in information your Child’s School provides to us.

**PARENT’S CHOICES REGARDING INFORMATION:** In general, we offer Parents the same choices that we generally offer to other users with respect to the collection, use, retention and disclosure of their Child’s information. In addition, a Parent has the right to review the Child’s personal information, which the Parent may obtain by contacting the Child’s School. After review the Child’s personal information, the Parent may ask us to update or delete the Child’s personal information by requesting such changes through the Child’s School. A Parent may prohibit us from sharing a Child’s personal information with a third party by requesting such prohibition through the Child’s School. Notwithstanding any such requests, we may continue to share a Child’s personal information for Internal Purposes and Enforcement Purposes.

If a Parent chooses to prohibit any future collection, use or disclosure of the Child’s personal information, the Parent may do so by terminating the Child’s Account through the School, and requesting the deletion of the Child’s personal information through the School. Upon receiving such request from the Child’s School, we will delete the Child’s Account information from our live databases and all information and data stored for such Account. Instructure will not have any liability whatsoever for any termination of the Account or related deletion of the Child’s personal information. When we delete personal information, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives.
