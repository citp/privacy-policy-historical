**3. _How We Share the Information We Collect or Receive_**

We may share information we collect or receive with third parties when we have your consent or as described below.

We may share information with the following types of third parties:

  * **Our affiliates**. We may share information with "affiliates," a term that includes our parent and subsidiary companies, joint venture partners, or other companies we control, are controlled by, or with which we are under common control. You can view a list of our affiliates [**here**](http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=98703).

We may provide information about you to service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf (for example, hosting our Services, storing our data, fulfilling orders, providing products and services, managing databases, performing analyses, processing credit card payments, providing customer service, or sending communications for us). These companies are contractually limited in the ways in which they may use this information.
  

  * **Our business partners**. With your consent, we may share information about you with select business partners that are not service providers, such as our sponsors, our broadcast partners, and our retail licensees, so that they can provide you with special offers, promotional materials, and other materials that may be of interest to you. Business partners are expected to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and security of any information we share with them. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of our business partners, which may use your information for their own purposes.

  * **Audience-measurement companies** , which help us measure the overall usage of our Services and compare that usage to other online services; and
  

  * **Social networking services** (such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+), which enable you to log in to certain of our Services, to comment on content available on our Services, and to share things you find on our Services with your social network.
  



These and other third parties may collect or receive information about your use of our Services, including through the use of **cookies, web beacons, and other technologies**, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected on different websites and online services. Social networking services may be able to collect information about you, even if you do not click on or interact with their content on our Services or have an account with the social networking service.

Note that some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers with choices about whether to receive targeted ads. To learn more and to opt-out of such targeted advertising, please visit the websites of the [**Network Advertising Initiative**](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/), the [**Digital Advertising Alliance**](http://www.aboutads.info/), and the [**Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada**](http://youradchoices.ca/).

The third party social networking services with which we partner may notify your friends and other connections, both on our Services and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of our Services or about your use of our Services. If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services, including information about your friends and other contacts on those social networking services. We may use the information pursuant to this Privacy Policy, but the main purpose for our use is to enhance your personal and social experience on our Services. For example, we might show you content that is popular among your friends or connections on a social networking service or provide you with a snapshot of the responses of your friends and other connections to that content.

You also may be able to link an account from a social networking service to an account through our Services. This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign in to certain features on our Services. If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Policy.

**5. _Notice to Rogers Communications Subscribers_**

Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates.

If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit our policy on responding to these signals.

_Cookies and Other Local Storage Technologies_

Generally speaking, "cookies" are text files that are placed in your device's browser, and that can be used to help recognize your browser across different web pages, websites, and browsing sessions.

Cookies are stored on your device or in "local storage."

These technologies are similar to cookies in that they are stored on your device and can be used to maintain information about your activities and preferences.

However, these other local storage technologies may use parts of your device other than your browser, which means you may not be able to control their use using the browser tools and settings you use to control browser cookies. For more information about managing Flash cookies, please visit the [**Adobe Flash Player website**](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html). Your browser's privacy controls may enable you to manage other types of local storage.

  * to help authenticate you when you use our Services;
  

  * to remember your preferences and registration information;
  

  * to enable a shopping cart;
  

  * to present and help measure and research the effectiveness of our Service, advertisements, and email communications (by determining which emails you open and act upon); and
  

  * to customize the content and advertisements provided to you through our Services.
  



_Web Beacons_

Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on Web pages, videos, and in emails that can communicate information about your browser and device to a server.
