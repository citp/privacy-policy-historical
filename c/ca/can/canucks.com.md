##### The Information We Collect and How We Use It

We collect and maintain different types of personal information which, subject to applicable law, may include the following:

·               information that helps us identify you and facilitates better communication such as your name, home address, postal code, telephone number, e-mail address and gender;

The legal bases for our processing of personal information are primarily that the processing is necessary for providing the CSE Sites and that the processing is carried out in our legitimate interests, including the following:

·               to provide you with services or information that you have requested from us. This would include, for example, e-mail services, ticket information, contest information, mail-order/consumer product catalogues, merchandise offers and event information;

·               to promote and market goods and services offered by the CSE Parties that we think may be of interest to you;

·               to promote and market goods and services offered by selected organizations, such as our corporate partners and the NHL, which we think may be of interest to you;

·               on the CSE Sites, we may use personal information to personalize the content or layout to customize and enhance the experience of your visit;

If you do not wish to receive further communications from us about the goods and services of the CSE Parties and/or our corporate partners or if you do not wish to receive other notifications, you may unsubscribe (where such communication takes the form of a commercial electronic message) or ask us not to contact you for these purposes.

##### Your Consent

We collect, use and disclose your personal information with your consent or as permitted or required by law. If you provide personal information about another person to us, we assume you have the consent of that individual to enable us to collect, use or disclose their information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you choose to provide personal information to us, we assume that you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

Typically, we will seek your consent at the time your personal information is collected. Where we want to use your personal information for a purpose not previously identified to you at the time of collection, we will seek your consent prior to our use of such information for this new purpose.

##### How We Collect Personal Information

We collect your personal information in a number of different ways. For example, we collect information from you when you register for one of our contests or promotions, sign up for one of our e-newsletters (such as, "E-News") or when you participate in market research studies conducted by us from time to time. We also collect your information when you subscribe to become one of our season ticket members or premium hospitality clients, or purchase goods or services from us, such as tickets. We may also collect your personal information when you request information from us to process a complaint that you have registered with us. We may acquire your name and address from list vendors to whom you have given your consent to send promotions or product information. We also have relationships with other companies, such as our corporate partners, advertisers and event promoters with whom we conduct joint marketing activities such as contests through which we may obtain your name and address and other information about you with your consent. Typically, the other parties involved are identified and information about their privacy practices is disclosed.

We will limit the amount and type of personal information collected from you to that which is reasonably necessary for the purposes it was collected. We will only keep your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the relevant purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and in order to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations. If you would like further information regarding the periods for which your personal information will be kept, please contact us as set forth in the "Contact" section.

##### Collection on or through CSE Sites

When you visit the CSE Sites, we may place a "cookie" on your computer. A cookie is a file written to your computer's hard drive that records certain technical information about your Internet usage, such as your IP address, browser type, or domain name. Also, if you submit personal information to the CSE Sites (such as your name, interests or preferences), we may use cookies to keep track of such information so that you will not need to re-enter this information during subsequent visits. We use cookies to customize the delivery of the CSE Sites' content and advertisements. We also use cookies so that we (or our third party advertising service providers) may, within our advertising network, serve you advertisements more relevant to your preferences based on your activities on the CSE Sites and other websites. We may also authorize our commercial partners (or their advertising service providers) to use cookies so that they may serve you advertisements relating to their products and services. You may limit the automatic collection of certain information by the CSE Sites, for instance by disabling the cookies using your browser options. Please be aware that by doing so it may prevent you from using specific features on the CSE Sites.

We may also use tracking pixels using Google Tag Manager. We may share information about you from cookies, device identifiers, location data and usage data with entities that are CSE Parties or become part of the CSE Parties. 

Web servers serving the CSE Sites may automatically collect information about which pages you visit, as well as your IP address or domain name. We may use this information for our internal web site business purposes, for example, to tailor content on CSE Sites or to assess the amount of traffic to the CSE Sites. We may also provide this information on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our marketing partners and/or advertisers.

The CSE Sites contain links to third party sites. The CSE Parties are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party web sites, and we recommend that you view the privacy policy posted on each site that you use to confirm that the site's policies are acceptable to you.

If you sign into the CSE Sites using your NHL.com account, you should also be aware of the terms and conditions of the NHL.com Privacy Policy, a link to which is provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.

We also work with third party social media platforms (such as Twitter and Facebook) to collect personal information through the CSE Sites for the purposes of conversion tracking (that is, to track whether your clicking on our advertisement led to a transaction such as a purchase) and so that we (or our third party advertising service providers) may, within our advertising network, serve you advertisements more relevant to your preferences.

##### How We Disclose Personal Information

Except as set out below, we will not sell, rent, transfer, or disclose your personal information to any third party without your consent. We may disclose your personal information:

1.             to third parties for the purpose of administering, processing, or fulfilling an order or service you have requested on our behalf, or process market research information collected, such as mailing houses, contest administration, etc. We will insist that any such third parties maintain the confidentiality of the personal information we provide them and implement appropriate safeguards to prevent its unauthorized disclosure;

2.             in connection with a corporate reorganization, restructuring, re-financing, merger or amalgamation, or pursuant to a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the CSE Parties or a division of the CSE Parties, provided that the uses of such personal information so disclosed continue to be the uses permitted by this Privacy Policy; and

3.             to law enforcement and governmental entities when required by law. For greater clarity, we may disclose personal information or other information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with applicable law, in response to a facially valid court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies.

In addition, we may provide your non-sensitive personal information (such as name, address, contact information and ticket membership status, if applicable) to our corporate partners and advertisers so that we or they may send you offers and information relating to products and services that may be of interest to you (subject to compliance with Canada's anti-spam legislation).

When we disclose your personal information to third parties, we take reasonable measures to ensure that the rules set forth in this Privacy Policy are complied with and these third parties provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures.

##### Security

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We maintain appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the personal information in our possession. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal information you transmit to us or store on the CSE Sites or other services, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or administrative safeguards. If you believe your personal information has been compromised, please contact us as set forth in the "Contact" section. If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform you and the authorities of the occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law.

Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage third party service providers. By using the CSE Sites, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside your country of residence, which may have different data protection rules than in your country. While such information is outside of Canada, it is subject to the laws of the country in which it is held, and may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of such other country, pursuant to the laws of such country. However, our practices regarding your personal information will at all times continue to be governed by this Privacy Policy and, if applicable, we will comply with the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of Personal Information from the EU/EEA to third country.

##### Access to Your Information

We will give you access to the information we retain about you. We will make every reasonable effort to keep your information accurate and up-to-date. Upon your request, you shall be informed of the existence, use and disclosure of your information. You may verify the accuracy and completeness of your information, and may request that it be amended, if appropriate. Simply send us an e-mail at privacy.officer@canucks.com and we will look after your request.

If you have any comments or questions about this Privacy Policy, or wish to withdraw your consent to our use of your personal information for any of the purposes contemplated herein, you may send us an e-mail at privacy.officer@canucks.com.

Under the GDPR, you may be entitled to additional rights, including: (i) the right to withdraw consent to processing where consent is the basis of processing; (ii) the right to access your personal information and certain other supplementary information, under certain conditions; (iii) the right to object to unlawful data processing, under certain conditions; (iv) the right to erasure of personal information about you, under certain conditions; (v) the right to demand that we restrict processing of your personal information, under certain conditions, if you believe we have exceeded the legitimate basis for processing, processing is no longer necessary, or believe your personal information is inaccurate; (vi) the right to data portability of personal information concerning you that you provided us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, under certain conditions; (vii) the right object to decisions being taken by automated means which produce legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you, under certain conditions; (viii) the right to lodge a complaint with data protection authorities. If you want to learn more about your rights under the GDPR, you can visit the European Commission's page on Data Protection at: (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/index_en.htm)

##### Changes to this Privacy Policy

The CSE Parties reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If this Privacy Policy is modified, we will post the modified Privacy Policy on the CSE Sites and indicate the date of the latest revision. Please review this Privacy Policy from time to time to ensure your familiarity with its terms. Your continued use of the CSE Sites constitutes your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time. This Privacy Policy relates to all on-line and off-line activities of the CSE Parties.

##### Information Requested from Children

We take our responsibilities to our younger patrons seriously. In addition to the steps we take to safeguard the privacy and integrity of personal information submitted by adults, we adhere to the following principles and practices regarding personal information of children. If you live in a country in the EU/EEA, you must be at least 16 years old to use the CSE Sites or such greater age required in your country to register for or use the CSE Sites. If you live in any other country except those in the EU/EEA, you must be at least 13 years old to use the CSE Sites or such greater age required in your country to register for use the CSE Sites. In addition to being of the minimum required age to use the CSE Sites under applicable law, if you are not old enough to have authority to agree to this Privacy Policy in your country, your parent or guardian must agree to this Privacy Policy on your behalf.

In general, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children via the CSE Sites, and we use age screening mechanisms to help prevent children from posting data on the CSE Sites, such as in our fan chat rooms (when available). We do not require children to register or to otherwise disclose personal information to participate in the activities in any youth-focused section of the CSE Sites. Where children are asked to register, the kind of information they are required to provide will not intrude on their privacy rights.

We may offer children the opportunity to enter promotions or contests. In this case, the child will be asked only to provide his or her name, age and parent's contact information. We will use the information only to notify the contest winner's parent, and will require that the winner's parent provide us with whatever information and authorization is needed to allow the child to claim the prize.

If you have any comments or questions on policies related to children's data or about our commitment to protecting your and your children's privacy, please send us an e-mail at privacy.officer@canucks.com.
