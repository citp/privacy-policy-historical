Your privacy is important to us. At _canucks.com_ we are committed to undertaking reasonable measures to protect the privacy, accuracy and reliability of your personal information and to protect such information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Please read the following description of our policies and practices regarding your personal information.

\- We may request personal information from visitors such as name, home address, e-mail address, age, income, interests and gender for purposes such as newsletter, chat room, contest and auction registration, and for participation in other interactive online activities. We also may use this information to better understand your needs and preferences and to recommend particular products and services that may meet your needs. We do not request sensitive personal information, such as racial or ethnic origin or health or medical data. Unless you have opted out, from time to time we may share such information with other businesses, including our marketing partners and advertisers. We will only share such information with third parties whose policies regarding personal information are consistent with our privacy policies and where we have your express or implied consent to do so. If you object to our sharing of your personal information with other businesses or if you do not wish to receive marketing communication from us or our partners, you will have the opportunity to indicate your objection when entering such information or you may [contact us](mailto:privacyofficer@orcabay.com) at any time. Understand that you can withdraw your consent whenever you want, unless legal requirements prevent this. However, not allowing us to use this information about you may mean that we may not be able to provide you with certain products and services. Additionally, we do provide personal data to agents who perform services for us (such as fulfillment companies) but these agents are not permitted to use the data for any other purposes.

\- From time to time, we may place a "cookie" on your computer. A cookie is a file written to your computer's hard drive that records certain technical information about your Internet usage, such as your IP address, browser type, or domain name. Also, if you submit personal information to our web site (such as your name, interests or preferences), we may use cookies to keep track of such information so that you will not need to reenter this information during subsequent visits. We use cookies to customize delivery of our web site content and advertisements. You may set your Internet browser preferences to notify you when you receive a cookie or decline acceptance of cookies. If you decline acceptance of cookies, however, you may experience less than optimal performance of our web site.

\- Web servers serving our web site may automatically collect information about which pages you visit, as well as your IP address or domain name. We may use this information for our internal web site business purposes, for example, to tailor our web site content or to assess the amount of traffic to our web site. We may also provide this information on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our marketing partners and/or advertisers.

\- We will give you access to the information we retain about you. We will make every reasonable effort to keep your information accurate and up-to-date. Upon your request, you shall be informed of the existence, use and disclosure of your information. You may verify the accuracy and completeness of your information, and may request that it be amended, if appropriate.

Information requested from children (users under 13 years old):

At orcabay.com, we take our responsibilities to our younger visitors seriously. In addition to the steps we take to safeguard the privacy and integrity of personal information submitted by adults, we adhere to the following principles and practices regarding personal information of children under 13 years old.

\- In general, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 via the Web site, and we use age screening mechanisms to help prevent children from posting data on the Web site, such as in our fan chat rooms (when available). We do not require children to register or to otherwise disclose personal information to participate in the activities in any youth-focused section of our Web site. Where children are asked to register, the kind of information they are required to provide will not intrude on their privacy rights.

\- We may offer children the opportunity to enter promotions or contests via the canucks.com Web site. In this case, the child will be asked only to provide his or her first name and email address, as well as his or her parent's email address. We will use the information only to notify the contest winners, and will require that the winner's parent provide us with whatever information is needed to provide the prize.

\- We may also post information on the Web site about other promotions or contests that are open to children but that require other personal information (such as home address or favourite hockey team) to enter. For these contests, children will be required to print a paper entry form from the Web site and have their parents sign and mail or fax the form to us. Children are not permitted to provide personal information via the Web site or to enter these contests online. ****

\- If you have any comments or questions about the information you or your children have submitted on this web site [click here](https://canucks-secure.com/insider/validate.jsp) to access an on-line process to access, review, verify, correct, amend, or remove such information. If you have any questions or comments about our use of your or your children's personal information or about our commitment to protecting your and your children's privacy, please [contact us](mailto:privacyofficer@orcabay.com).
