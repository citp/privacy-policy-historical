# Privacy statement : Cancer Research UK : CancerHelp UK

At Cancer Research UK we are committed to protecting your privacy. This statement describes how Cancer Research UK collects and uses personal information about people who visit our websites. The terms of this statement may change, so please check it from time to time.

If you have any queries about this privacy statement please contact the Data Protection Coordinator at the Legal Department, Cancer Research UK, Angel Building, 407 St John Street, London EC1V 4AD or email [dataprotection@cancer.org.uk](mailto:dataprotection@cancer.org.uk).

We obtain personal information from you when you enquire about our activities, register with us, send or receive an e-postcard, make a donation to us, ask a question about cancer or otherwise provide us with personal information. We may also receive information about you from third parties, for example from our service providers or from a friend who wants to tell you about our websites or the fundraising activities we carry out.

The personal information we collect might include name, date of birth, email address, postal address, telephone number and credit/debit card details. We may also collect health information if you tell us about your cancer experience or the experiences of a friend or relative.

We also gather general information about the use of our websites, such as which pages users visit most often and which services, events or facilities are of most interest. We may also track which pages users visit when they click on links in Cancer Research UK emails. We may use this information to personalise the way our websites are presented when users visit them, to make improvements to our websites and to ensure we provide the best service for users. Wherever possible we use aggregated or anonymous information which does not identify individual visitors to our websites.

We will use your personal information:

  * to provide you with the services, products or information you have requested;
  * to create an account for you if you register with us;
  * for administration purposes;
  * to further our charitable aims, including for fundraising activities.



As part of this, we may analyse the personal information we collect to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that we can contact you in the most appropriate way and with the most relevant information. Where relevant, we may also assess your personal information for the purposes of fraud and credit risk reduction.

If you enter your contact details in one of our online registration forms, we may use this information to contact you even if you don’t "send" or "submit" the form. We will only do this to see if we can help with any problems you might be experiencing with the form or with our websites.

We may need to share your information with our service providers, associated organisations and agents for the purposes described above.

If you contact the [cancer information nurses](https://web.archive.org/web/20140419114233id_/http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/utilities/privacy/ssNODELINK/contact-cancer-nurses), you may choose to provide details of a personal nature. Only the cancer information nurses will use your personal information and only for the purposes of dealing with your enquiry. They will not pass on your details to anyone else without your express permission, except in exceptional circumstances to comply with the nurses’ code of professional conduct or the law. Examples of this might include children contacting the service reporting abuse, anyone reporting serious self harm, anyone expressing the intention of harming someone else, or if a terrorist threat is reported.

Your personal information and details of the enquiries received are stored on a secure database. If for any reason you wish to have your personal details removed from their records, please [contact the cancer information nurses](https://web.archive.org/web/20140419114233id_/http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/utilities/privacy/ssNODELINK/SendAQuestion).

If you send website feedback, the feedback will be noted and acted on as appropriate.  Your feedback will be recorded within a month of receipt, but your contact details will not be kept. If you have sent a complaint to the site, the correspondence will be kept securely in a complaints file for a maximum of one year, in case we need to refer back to it.

You have a choice about whether you want to receive information about our progress and fundraising activities. We will not use your personal information for marketing purposes if you have indicated that you do not wish to be contacted. You can change your marketing preferences at any time by contacting Supporter Services at Cancer Research UK, Angel Building, 407 St John Street, London EC1V 4AD, by phone on 020 7121 6699, or email [supporter.services@cancer.org.uk](mailto:supporter.services@cancer.org.uk).

Cancer Research UK is concerned to protect the privacy of children aged under 16. Some of our websites, such as Race for Life, have specific rules about how children under 16 can take part in our events. Where appropriate we will seek consent from a parent or guardian before collecting personal information about a child aged under 16.
