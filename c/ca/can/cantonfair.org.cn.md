If you are a visitor or customer from the European Union, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

 **Data retention**

We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

If you are a resident of the European Union, you have the following data protection rights:

If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading.

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
