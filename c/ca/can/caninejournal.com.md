The following is a summary of the kinds of information we collect at the Site from our users, and how we collect that information:

### Passive Collection

Our software automatically collects certain information from a user’s computer when that user logs on or moves about our Site. We do not link this information to any other Personal Information the user tells us; we only use it to get a broad picture of who is on our Site and which areas our users are visiting. This information tells us what’s important to our users and what isn’t, allows us to make our Site more interesting and useful, and enhances security and efficiency on our Site. The two main ways in which we collect this general information are through:

  *  **Log Files** – log files are records of user activity collected to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements, and gather broad types of information for aggregate use. The kinds of general information we collect in the log files include:

Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personal information, it merely helps the Site to be more efficient. Typically, a cookie enables a user’s computer to load Web site files faster on subsequent visits. We may also use cookies to track a user’s path for security purposes, as well as to target a user’s interests in an effort to enhance the user’s experience on our Site. If a user wishes to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, the user may refer to browser instructions to learn about these functions. If a user rejects a cookie, the user may still use our Site, however, the user may be limited in the use of certain areas. For example, if the user disables cookies the **font sizing** feature will not work properly.
