**Purchasing:**  
When making online purchases, we will keep all purchasing information strictly confidential. This includes, but is not limited to; your full name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address. All credit card processing is done over a secure server, utilizing 128-bit SSL encryption. Please note that we will never store your credit card number.
