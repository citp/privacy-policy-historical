# Privacy | CanLII

All questions, comments and requests concerning the present document should be emailed to the CanLII Editor using the [feedback form](https://web.archive.org/en/feedback/feedback.html). 

1. CanLII avoids collecting and storing personal information and, if personal information on users is received, CanLII treats it with utmost confidentiality. CanLII complies with applicable Canadian legislation on privacy protection.

2\. CanLII adheres to the principle of openness and transparency of legislative and judicial processes, and recognizes their fundamental importance in democratic societies. In order to minimize the negative impact of such transparency on the privacy of those involved in cases leading to judicial decisions, CanLII does not permit its case law collections to be indexed by external search engines.

## Information on Website Users

3\. CanLII does not gather personal information on site users. When a user contacts CanLII, personal information may be conveyed at the user’s discretion. CanLII considers such information to be confidential. Personal information on users that comes into CanLII’s possession is destroyed or erased as soon as CanLII no longer requires it for the purposes for which it was provided.

4\. CanLII gathers information on the use of its services for the sole purpose of keeping statistics on visits and ensuring smooth operation of its website’s services. CanLII does not attempt to identify users, and information gathered is never used to establish user profiles. Moreover, information gathered is never disclosed to third parties, unless such disclosure is required by law or needed to prevent misuse or unauthorized use of services offered by CanLII.

**Data on Visits**

5\. When a user accesses a website, various pieces of information circulate between the user’s computer and the website’s server. CanLII stores the transactional information related to user computers. The information consists in:

  * The IP address and corresponding domain name, if available;
  * The operating system and web browser employed;
  * The address of the referring site, if the user reached CanLII from another site;
  * The query on the search engine of the referring site, if applicable;
  * The pages visited on CanLII;
  * The date, time and duration of the visit;
  * The queries made on CanLII’s search engine.



6\. CanLII gathers this information in order to track the number of visitors, pages most often visited, technology used by users, referring sites and users’ countries of origin. Analysis of this data enables CanLII to improve its site, develop new services and prevent misuse of its resources.

**Cookies**

7\. A cookie is saved on the user computer’s hard disk in order to record the choice of language made when CanLII is visited for the first time. The cookie expires 30 days after the last use of CanLII. It is also possible to erase it at any time by clicking here. Users can also refuse cookies by changing their preferences in their web browser. Since cookies are not necessary to use CanLII, users who refuse cookies can navigate CanLII web pages freely and without any problem.

**Feedback Form**

8\. When users complete the feedback form, it is possible for them to provide their names, organization’s name and email address. The information is used and stored only as required to process the request and to establish general statistics.

**Mailing List**

9\. Users who subscribe to CanLII mailing lists must provide valid email addresses, and may provide their names, at their discretion. The information is gathered uniquely for the purposes of managing and operating the list, and is destroyed when the subscriber terminates the subscription. Users always have access to their accounts and can correct information and terminate subscriptions themselves.

**Management of Information Gathered by CanLII**

10\. In order to ensure compliance with the present policy and applicable legislation on privacy protection, an officer is appointed to see to respect for the principles stated here and legislation applicable to protection of personal information on users. The Privacy Policy Officer can be contacted using the [feedback form](https://web.archive.org/en/feedback/feedback.html).

11\. All information gathered by CanLII is kept in a secure computer environment to which access is restricted. CanLII employees who gather, store and use personal information are required to ensure that their activities comply with the present policy. CanLII makes a commitment to maintain a high degree of security.

## Information in Documents Published by CanLII

12\. CanLII publishes documents in the form in which they are received from the institutions that issue them, such as official publishers, courts and law societies. The documents are public. CanLII considers that publishing the complete documents, including the personal information they may contain, is primordial to implementing the principles of openness and transparency that govern Canadian public institutions.

13\. With respect to court decisions, the transparency characteristic of the Canadian judicial system protects the impartiality of the judiciary, ensures the fairness of the judicial process and enables individuals to base their conduct on precedents established by judges. CanLII does not edit the content of court decisions except to comply with publication bans imposed by statutes or courts and in accordance with the policies of the institution that provided the text of the decision.

14\. In order to limit prejudice to individuals that could result from free publication of documents containing personal information, CanLII is actively involved in advancing standards and policies that promote optimal protection of the privacy of people who appear before the courts.

**Indexing of Decisions by External Search Engines**

15\. Through application of [recognized web robot exclusion protocols](http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/exclusion.html) and by restricting indexing activities in its [terms of use](https://web.archive.org/en/info/terms.html), CanLII prohibits external search engines from indexing the text and case name of decisions published on its website, except for Supreme Court of Canada decisions. When indexing prohibitions in robot exclusion protocols are complied with, searching for the name of an individual using an Internet search engine does not return decisions published on CanLII. However, when a third party links to a CanLII decision on a web page that is not under CanLII’s control, names that are included in this page or in the link’s text might still be indexed by external search engines. Neither CanLII nor its partners represent or guarantee that the technological and legal measures taken to prevent external indexing will be respected or be free of mistakes or malfunctions.

**Requests Concerning the Content of Published Documents**

16\. All requests concerning the content of a document published on the CanLII website should be submitted to CanLII’s Editor or Privacy Policy Officer using the [feedback form](https://web.archive.org/en/feedback/feedback.html). If the request is to withdraw or amend a decision, it will be studied in light of applicable rules pertaining to publication restrictions. Requests for withdrawal or amendment that are not justified by relevant legislative provisions or a court order restricting publication will be refused. Persons wishing to submit a request for withdrawal but who do not know the law applicable to their situation are asked to contact their lawyer or the registry of the court that rendered the decision.
