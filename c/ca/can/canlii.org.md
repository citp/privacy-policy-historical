### Cookies

8. Navigating the CanLII website does not require the use of cookies. However, in order to allow for easier and customized user navigation CanLII creates and saves cookies files on a user computer when, for instance, the user checks a box displaying a message such as “Do not display this warning anymore” or “Save these settings as the default values”. When a cookies file is created, the cookie only contains the information required for the technical features described in these messages, with no personal user data.

### Feedback Form

9. When a user completes the CanLII [feedback form](http://www.canlii.org/feedback/commentaires.html), the user has the option of providing his/her name, an organization name and an e-mail address. Such information is collected only for the purposes of addressing the user’s particular concern or comment and to follow-up on requests received at CanLII through this form. Names and e-mail addresses are never added to any mailing list and are duly deleted immediately after the user request or comment has been addressed.

### Mailing Lists

10. A user subscribing to a mailing list on CanLII (the “subscriber”) must provide a valid e-mail address and has the option of providing a name. Mailing list user data is collected only for the management and operation of these lists. The subscriber can consult or modify their mailing list information by following the instructions found on CanLII’s [mailing lists page](https://web.archive.org/web/20050403152856id_/http%3A//www.canlii.org/subscription.html).

### Personal Data Security

11. Information collected about CanLII users and their computers is maintained in a secure environment. CanLII personnel are strictly bound to ensure the confidentiality of any personal CanLII user data.

12. CanLII strives to maintain a consistently high level of security to ensure the confidentiality of CanLII user data. However, except in cases of intentional or gross fault, CanLII declines all liability for any damage or harm caused by any third person managing to access any such stored data.

## C. Personal Information Contained Within Published Documents

13. CanLII publishes documents as received from decision issuing institutions, that is, official printers, courts and tribunals, or law societies. These documents are already of a public nature. CanLII considers that the complete and unabriged dissemination of these documents, including any personal information these documents contain, is paramount to the realization of the principle of openness governing public institutions in Canada.

14. CanLII does not systematically examine the content of statutes and regulations published on its Web site and does not edit or modify the content of these documents. With regard to the decisions, CanLII detects possible restrictions on publication and modifies the content of these documents only to the extent required by the Law.

15. In order to minimize the prejudicial impact on individuals resulting from the wide access to documents containing personal information, CanLII is actively involved in the advancement of standards and formal guidelines that promote an optimal level of privacy protection.

### Personal Information Contained in Decisions

16. Canadian courts and tribunal decisions are meant to be of a public nature. This fundamental characteristic of the Canadian judicial system protects the impartiality of the judiciary, ensures the equity of the judicial system and allows for citizens and their legal representatives, in their own legal proceedings, to base themselves upon precedents set by judges. CanLII respects the public nature of decisions and publishes the complete and unabriged textual content of these documents, including any possible personal information contained within these decisions.

17. CanLII and its partners cannot be held liable for prejudice caused by the lawful publication of any public document containing personal information on the CanLII Web site, nor by the eventual dissemination or re-use of these public documents by a third person.

18. In certain exceptional cases, the principle of complete and unabriged publication of decisions is waived by law. In these cases, the law prohibits the disclosure of some pieces of information such as information that would allow for the identification of certain participants in the judicial system. CanLII abides by these legal restrictions on publication, in collaboration with the decision issuing institutions.

### Decision Indexing and Storage

19. CanLII does not allow search engines to index the content and case names of any trial decision and most appeal decisions published on the CanLII Web site.

20. Moreover, CanLII prohibits the storage of any decision available on the CanLII Web site when such stored decisions could be publicly accessible.

21. CanLII uses all the technological tools and methods currently available to prevent the external indexing or storage of its decision collections by search engines. Nonetheless, CanLII and its partners cannot be held liable for any situation wherein a third party manages to override the measures taken at CanLII.

### Requests regarding the Content of Published Documents

22. Any request regarding the content of a document published on the CanLII Web site must be sent to CanLII’s Editor or Privacy Policy Officer. CanLII decides whether a document should remain, be replaced or removed from the CanLII Web site only after having obtained the advice from the registrar or other authorized officer of this document’s issuing institution.
