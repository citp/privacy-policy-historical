<b>Nabisco Online Privacy Policy</b><br>
This Policy relates only to our online information collection and use

about any information they provide us on-line, and how we maintain and use this information.
To address these concerns and to demonstrate our commitment to privacy, especially for children 
who visit our sites, we have developed and implemented this Privacy Policy for our domestic

relates only to our online information collection and use practices.  As this policy may change from
time to time, we encourage you to periodically check it.

<li>We do not<b> share</b> any information you provide us with anyone outside of Nabisco and its parent

These suppliers are legally obligated to maintain the
confidentiality of any information we provide them, including your information

<strong><u>General</u></strong><br>
We only collect personally identifiable information on a voluntary basis.
We do not require that you provide this information to gain access to
our sites, and we do not require you to disclose more information than is
reasonably needed to participate in an activity on our sites.  We collect personally identifiable
information primarily to e-mail updates and news, for entry into promotions and
to notify subsequent winners, to send out brochures, etc. via regular mail to
subscribers, and to respond to your questions or suggestions.  We do not sell any information we gather at
our web sites to anyone outside of Nabisco and its parent
company, Kraft Foods North America, Inc..  We do not transfer or disclose any information we gather at our web
sites to anyone outside of Nabisco and its parent
company, Kraft Foods North America, Inc., without your prior consent, except (1) in
cases where we believe in good faith that we have a legal obligation to
disclose such information, and (2) to certain suppliers that assist Nabisco in
maintaining and managing the activities on its web sites, including, for
example, fulfillment of prizes awarded in connection with an online game.  Please be assured that these suppliers are
legally obligated to maintain the confidentiality of this information and do
not acquire any rights to use your information for their own benefit.  We may share non-identifiable aggregate
information about our users (for example, the % of male and female visitors to
our sites) with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third
parties in an effort to customize or enhance the content and advertising on our
sites for our users. 
<br><br>
We do reserve the right, in
connection with the potential sale or transfer of the interests of Nabisco and
its subsidiaries and affiliates, to sell or transfer your information
(including but not limited to your address, name, age, gender, zip code, state,
and country of residency and other information that your provide through other
communications) to a third party entity that (1) concentrates its business in a
similar practice or service, (2) agrees to be Nabisco’s successor in interest
with regard to the maintenance and protection of the information collected, and
(3) agrees to the obligations of this privacy policy.<br><br>

<b><u><a name="polls">Polls &amp; Surveys</a></u></b><br>
We periodically conduct polls and surveys on our sites.  The information we collect from these polls and surveys is only for Nabisco’s
use.  If sample answers to polls or surveys are posted on one of our web sites, no identifiable information is
included.<br><br>
<b><u><a name="promotions">Promotions</a></u></b><br>
Our sites frequently include notices for contests and sweepstakes that we are conducting.  For those contests and sweepstakes where we
permit you to enter electronically, we will use the information that you
provide us only for the purposes of conducting the promotion (e.g., to contact
you if you are a winner).  We do not share this information with anyone outside of Nabisco except for suppliers who
assist us in conducting the promotion and who are legally obligated to maintain
the confidentiality of any information we provide them.  Once the promotion has ended, the
information you provide us is deleted after a reasonable period of time.<br><br>

</td>
</tr><tr><td> <font face="verdana" size="2">
In communicating directly with
children over the Internet, we recognize the unique issues raised about the
protection of their privacy.  Our web sites that appeal to children, such as <a href="http://www.candystand.com/">www.candystand.com</a> and <a href="http://www.nabiscoworld.com/">www.NabiscoWorld.com</a>,
are designed to comply with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy
Protection Act (COPPA) and Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) guidelines
for web sites gathering personally identifiable information from children under
13.  Consistent with these requirements and guidelines, we do NOT:
<ul>
<li>collect,use or disclose on-line contact information from children except in connection
 with on-line promotions,discussed more fully below.  Without prior parental consent, such on-line contact information will only
be used to respond directly to the child's request and will not be used for
other purposes;</li>
<li>collect personally identifiable off-line contact
information unless for purposes of awarding prizes and only then with prior
parental consent;</li>
<li>distribute to third parties any personally identifiable
information;</li>
<li>enable children to publicly post or otherwise distribute
personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent; or</li>
<li>entice children by the prospect of a special game, prize
or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in
the activity.</li></ul>


<br>We do offer promotions (e.g., contests, sweepstakes) on
our web sites that appeal to children.  In those cases where children under the age of 13 are allowed to participate, the child is instructed to
first obtain his/her parent’s or legal guardian’s consent to participate and to
enter the email address of his/her parent or guardian.  If the game or contest involves the posting
of screen names of the high scorers, we only allow high scorers who are under
13 to select a generic screen name from a list that has been developed in
advance so as to prevent the disclosure of any personally identifiable
information.  If a child under 13 is selected as a prize-winner, an e-mail is sent to the parent or guardian. This
e-mail contains a form that requests the child’s complete name and address and
a parental permission form.  For the child to receive the prize, the parent or guardian must first fill out and sign
the form and then mail or fax it to the address or number indicated on the
form.  We do not use the information collected on the form for any purpose other than the completion of the
promotion, and we do not share the information with anyone outside of Nabisco
(other than suppliers, as explained above).  We delete both the child’s and the parent’s personally
identifiable information from our databases after a reasonable period of time
once the promotion has ended.<br><br>


We may permit a child to send us an e-mail or send an e-mail to a friend through our sites.  We will respond to or deliver the e-mail, as
the case may be, but we do not store the names, addresses, or the e-mails in our
operational database, nor do we share this information with any third parties.<br><br>


As a parent, you can always ask to review any personal information about your child that we may have
collected at one of our sites, have us delete this information (if we still
have the information in our databases), and/or instruct us not to collect or
use your child’s information in the future.  If you are a parent and wish to exercise this right, simply
