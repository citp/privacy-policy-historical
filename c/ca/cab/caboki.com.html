<h2>How we gather information from users</h2>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you request free sample or when you make a purchase. Like most Web sites, Caboki.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit.</p>
<h2>The Types of Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
<p>During registration you are required to give us your name, email address and a password.  We use this information to create your account, send you monthly newsletters which you may opt-out of at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions located at the bottom of each communication or by logging into your account and deselecting the box, and contact you about the services in which you have expressed interest.</p>
<p>If you purchase a product from us, we request certain personal information from you on our order form.  You must provide contact information (such as name, email and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.</p>
<p>We will send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.</p>
<p>Based upon the personal information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your account information and a newsletter sign up verification email. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask for your friend's email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of the referral program.</p>
<p>Your friend may contact us at <a class="blue" href="mailto:privacy@caboki.com">privacy@caboki.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<p>Like other web sites, we collect information to enhance your visit. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used to enhance user experience. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).</p>
<h2>Who We May Share Your Information With</h2>
<p>We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order, processing your payment, or offering customer services.  These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, in response to a court order, at other times when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>
<h2>Children</h2>

<h2>Access to Personal Information</h2>
<p>If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, delete inaccuracies, or request deletion of your account by making the change within the “my account” section of the site or by emailing us at <a class="blue" href="mailto:privacy@caboki.com">privacy@caboki.com</a>. We will respond to your access request within 30 days.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
<p>We use [both] session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once.  Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.</p>
<p>The use of third party cookies is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>
<h2>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h2>
<p>We employ or our third party tracking utility service employs  a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie [do not tie] the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receicve it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.</p>
<p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personal information.</p>
<p>This privacy policy applies only to information collected by this Web site.</p>
<h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
