# CABI | Privacy policy

At CABI we are committed to protecting your privacy. This statement discloses the privacy practices for all of CABI's websites.

We collect personally identifiable information about visitors to our websites. Through online forms, we collect some or all of the following details:

  * Name 
  * Organization 
  * Job title/position 
  * Mailing address 
  * Email address 
  * Telephone number 
  * Fax number 



We use this information for the following purposes:

  * To satisfy customer orders 
  * To perform statistical analyses measuring customer interest in various areas of our sites 
  * To supply customers (via email or conventional mail) with pertinent information on new products and services, if such a service is requested 
  * To carry out targeted market research exercises, if the customer has opted in to such activities



A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent by another website to your web browser, where it becomes stored for later retrieval; usually it is a text file which is placed in the browser directory of your computer's hard drive.

The cookie cannot be read by any website other than the one that set up the cookie.

Most web browsers will accept cookies by default, but they can be set to reject cookies, either from all websites or from specific sites. You can also manually delete cookies from your web browser. These options are generally set through a "privacy" setting in your browser setup.

Several of CABI's websites use cookies to recognise users after they have registered to use a website or paid for access to a website. On occasion, we permit third parties to place and read cookies on our customers' browsers, in order to deliver information of relevance to the user.

Cookies will enable our web-sites to recognize the information you have consented to give and use it to present you with custom web pages. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page, you might see a welcome page with your name on it.

If you do not wish to receive information from CABI other than that requested, please contact us at [enquiries@cabi.org ](mailto:enquiries@cabi.org)
