## What about cookies?

A 'cookie' is a small piece of information that is sent by another website to your web browser, where it becomes stored for later retrieval; usually it is a text file which is placed in the brower directory of your computer's hard drive. The cookie cannot be read by any website other than the one that set up the cookie.

Several of CABI Publishing websites use cookies to recognise users after they have registered to use a website, or paid for access to a website.

Cookies will enable our web-sites to recognize the information you have consented to give and use it to present you with custom web pages. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page you might see a welcome page with your name on it.

We will NOT use cookies to examine your surfing behaviour before or after leaving a CAB International web-site.

## What we don't do

CAB International does not, under any circumstance, sell, trade or rent your personal details to any third party. 

If you do not wish to receive information from CAB International, other than that requested, please contact us at [corporate@cabi.org](mailto:marketing@cabi.org)
