At CABI we are committed to protecting your privacy. This statement discloses the privacy practices for all of CABI's websites.

######

We collect personally identifiable information about visitors to our websites. Through online forms, we collect some or all of the following details:

  * name
  * organization
  * job title/position
  * mailing address
  * email address
  * telephone number
  * fax number



######   
What do we do with this information?

We use this information for the following purposes:

  * to satisfy customer orders
  * to perform statistical analyses measuring customer interest in various areas of our sites
  * to supply customers (via email or conventional mail) with pertinent information on new products and services, if such a service is requested

######   
What about cookies?

We use cookies to recognise users after they have registered to use a website or paid for access to a website. On occasion, we permit third parties to place and read cookies on our customers' browsers, in order to deliver information of relevance to the user.

Cookies will enable our web-sites to recognize the information you have consented to give and use it to present you with custom web pages. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page, you might see a welcome page with your name on it. Some features on this site will not function if you do not allow cookies.
