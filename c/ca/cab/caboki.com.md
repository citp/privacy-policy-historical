## How we gather information from users

How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you request free sample or when you make a purchase. Like most Web sites, Caboki.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit.

## The Types of Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It

During registration you are required to give us your name, email address and a password. We use this information to create your account, send you monthly newsletters which you may opt-out of at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions located at the bottom of each communication or by logging into your account and deselecting the box, and contact you about the services in which you have expressed interest.

If you purchase a product from us, we request certain personal information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

We will send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.

Based upon the personal information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your account information and a newsletter sign up verification email. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.

Like other web sites, we collect information to enhance your visit. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.

Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used to enhance user experience. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).

## Who We May Share Your Information With

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order, processing your payment, or offering customer services. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

In certain situations, Caboki may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose your information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, in response to a court order, at other times when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

## Children

Caboki.com does not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13.

If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, delete inaccuracies, or request deletion of your account by making the change within the "my account" section of the site or by emailing us at [privacy@caboki.com](mailto:privacy@caboki.com). We will respond to your access request within 30 days.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active of as needed to provide you services.

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## Customer Reviews

We post customer reviews/video reviews on our Web site which may contain personal information. We do obtain the customer’ consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial/video. To request removal of your personal information or video from our reviews, contact us at [privacy@caboki.com](mailto:privacy@caboki.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

## Surveys

We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

We use this information Describe fully how the data collected is to be used, e.g., to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), to send participants an email newsletter.

We use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. Use the latter disclosure only if your service-provider contracts expressly prohibit this. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

## Social Media Widgets

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

## Passive Collection

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site. 

## Tracking Technologies

Caboki and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.

## Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receicve it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
