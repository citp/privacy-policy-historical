<p><strong><em>What personally identifiable information is being collected and used?</em></strong></p>
<p>In general, you can visit the Cabela’s Canada website without telling us who you are or providing us with any personally identifiable information. However, in order for us to provide you with the products, services or other information that you have requested, you may be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information. For example, when you order a product, we may ask you to become a registered user of our website, during which you will be asked for your name, shipping and billing addresses, your e-mail address, and your telephone number. Similarly, when you purchase products through our <span class="cbword">catalogue</span>, we collect the name, address, e-mail address and telephone number of the purchaser. We may also collect the name, address and telephone number of the person to whom the items are to be shipped (if different than the purchaser). Third-party shipping information shall only be used for the purpose of processing and fulfilling the order. The information we collect is used to process your order and provide you with the products and services you have requested. You do not have to provide us with any personally identifiable information when you purchase products at our retail store by cash.</p>
<p>If you use a credit or debit card to purchase a product online, in-store, or through our <span class="cbword">catalogue</span>, your payment card related information and your signature will be collected for the purposes of processing your payment. If you pay for a purchase by money order, cheque or C.O.D, the name, address, e-mail address and telephone number of the purchaser will be collected in order to identify you and contact you regarding your payment, if necessary.</p>
<p>If you request to receive our catalogues, e-mails, newsletters, or other marketing materials we may collect your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. If you wish to stop receiving any of these materials, you may contact us at&nbsp;<strong>1.800.265.6245</strong>, send us an e-mail at&nbsp;<a style="color: #718116; text-decoration: none;" href="mailto:privacyofficer@cabelas.ca"><strong>privacyofficer@cabelas.ca</strong></a>, or write us at the postal address provided above. &nbsp;E-mail recipients can also opt-out from receiving future emails by using the opt-out link in each e-mail.</p>
<p>If you request, we may make your postal mailing address information available to subsidiaries and affiliated companies that are part of the Cabela's family of companies, or to other direct mail companies who we believe may have products and services of interest to our customers, for the marketing purposes of those companies.

We may use this information to help us carry the right assortment of products for your needs and to tailor the promotional material you receive.</p>

<p><em><strong>How to access, update, or correct my personally identifiable information?</strong></em></p>
<p>If you are a registered user of our website, you can manage many aspects of your registration information online. For security reasons, however, some parts of your personal information may not be changed online and may require you to call or write to us in order to verify your identity before such changes can be made. The online registration area will also permit you to exercise control over the use of your e-mail address, allowing you to opt-out of future e-mail messages from Cabela’s Canada. If you prefer to manage your personal information via other means, or if you would like to access, update, or correct any of your personal information we have in our possession, you may contact us at <strong>1.800.265.6245</strong>, send us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacyofficer@cabelas.ca"><strong>privacyofficer@cabelas.ca</strong></a>, or write us at the postal address provided above.</p>

<p><em><strong>What are cookies and how does Cabela’s Canada use them?</strong></em></p>
<p>A cookie is a block of text placed in a file on the user's hard drive by a website you've visited. These types of cookies cannot identify an individual user specifically, such as by name or address, unless the cookie data is attached to personally identifiable information such as online registration.

<p>Cabela's Canada also uses a session cookie, which is a piece of identification between your browser and our server, which helps to do things like keep track of the items in a user's shopping cart, and other information. The shopping cart cookie is saved for a designated period of time in case the users' session expires or they return to complete a purchase within that time frame. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from the Cabela’s Canada website, you may limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our website.</p>
