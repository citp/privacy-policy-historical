Here at CableWholesale.com, we know it can at times feel forbidding to input personal information with your order. Customers are sometimes hesitant to enter e-mail addresses, phone numbers, or credit card information. We have therefore adopted the following Privacy Policy, so that our customers may be assured that their personal information never leaves our company, and is used only for practical purposes in the order process. Listed below are our policies.

  1. We collect only the information that is necessary to keep the customer well apprised of their order status. We use the provided information to send order and shipping confirmations, and to notify customers of delays or special situations. While we may store a customer's e-mail address to pass along an occasional technical newsletter or a coupon for special savings, we do not telemarket or send unsolicited e-mail at any time.
  2. Your information never leaves CableWholesale.com. We do not sell or release any customer information to third parties. There are no exceptions to this.
