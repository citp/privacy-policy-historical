In general, you may visit this website without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. CA collects domain information from your visit to customize and improve your experience on our website. 

Some portions of this website may require you to give us personally identifiable information, which is information that enables us to identify you, such as your name, email or other address.

**Choice/Opt-Out**  
It is our intent to inform you before we collect personally identifiable information, and tell you what we intend to do with it. You will have the option of not providing the information, in which case you may still be able to access other portions of this website, although you may not be able to access certain programs or services. In certain portions of this website, we also may enable you to "opt out" of certain uses of your information, or elect not to receive future communications or services.
