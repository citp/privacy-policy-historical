There may be times (such as when you purchase or order a product, subscribe to a service, or participate in contests, sweepstakes or promotions, etc.) at which we ask you to provide certain information about yourself, such as your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, email address and credit card information. We also maintain a record of your product purchases. Whether or not to provide such information is completely your own choice. But if you choose not to provide the information we request, we may not be able to process your order or provide the services required. Cookies  
Our web site uses "cookies." A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Generally, we use cookies to remind us of who you are, tailor our products and services to suit your personal interests, estimate our audience size and analyze your visiting patterns, in order to enhance your shopping experience.

**Protecting Children**  
Cafe Britt takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of children. Our web site is a general audience site. Don’t forget, Cafe Britt is a great resource for all kinds of research projects on coffee. We’d love to hear from you and your children. Cafe Britt encourages children under 16 to get their parents permission before contacting us or submitting any information to us. Of course, there is nothing better than personal supervision of children while they surf the Internet.  

**Security**  
When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. All your personal information is encrypted before it is transmitted over the Internet. If you prefer not to enter your credit card online, you can call or fax in your credit information after you place your order online. Call us at 1-800-GO BRITT (1-800 462-7488) in the US and Canada; or fax us at 1-800-652-5679.  
Note: Most banks either cover all the charges that result from unauthorized use of your credit card or limit your liability to US$50, the maximum liability allowed under the Fair Credit Billing Act. You must notify your credit card provider of the unauthorized use in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures. 

**Disclosure to outside third parties**  
Cafe Britt respects your privacy. Any information you give us is held with the utmost care and security, and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented. However Cafe Britt may share non-personal aggregate, or summary, information regarding its customers with partners or other third parties, but Cafe Britt does not sell or share any information at the individual customer level. Cafe Britt cannot control and thus assumes no responsibility in relation with the use third parties may give to information they collect in contests run as co-promotions.
