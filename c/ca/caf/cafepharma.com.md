Registered users may opt to have email sent to them through these sections (for instance, when they receive a reply to a post or classified ad), but it is always the users’ choice to do so, and may be changed at any time.**

**Some advertisers who put banner ads on our site may be able to identify the IP address and clickstream of those on our site. We will not accept any ads of any kind that reveal an individual’s personal information.**
