<p>
At CafeMom, CMI Marketing, Inc. (d/b/a CafeMom, "CafeMom") is committed
to maintaining your privacy and your trust. This Privacy Policy explains
how we collect, protect, use and share information about you when you
use the CafeMom website (the "Site"). We hope this information increases
your confidence in CafeMom and enhances your experience on our Site.
Each time that you use the Site, you signify that you agree to be bound
by the <a href="/about/tos.php">Terms of Service</a> and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to
the terms of this Privacy Policy you must discontinue using the Service
and terminate your membership if you are a registered user.
</p>
<h2>I. ABOUT CAFEMOM</h2>
<p>
CafeMom.com is an online service for moms that allows our mom members to
set up unique personal profiles and through those profiles to create an
online network of other moms and join in conversation. Site members
("Members") can view each other's profiles, communicate with old friends
and make new friends on the Site, share photos and videos, play games,
create and post in groups, comment on blog posts, and more. To enrich
our Members' experience, we request and display some personal
information to other Members and visitors, which allows our users to
identify each other and expand their network of friends. Site members
can change their profile information at any time, manage who can see
certain personal information and can control how other Members and
CafeMom communicates with them.
</p>
<h2>II. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
<p>
<strong>From Members</strong><br>
CafeMom collects information from you when you register with our Site,
update your profile, interact with other Members and non-Member users,
and use various features of our Site. To register with the Site, we ask
you to provide your name, birthdate, zip code and email address, and
select a screen name and password. Once you are registered you will be
given the option to add additional information about you and your family
to your profile.
</p>
<p>
We also collect information regarding your activities on the Site,
including interaction with other users and your use of the Site. From
time to time we may ask you to respond to surveys or other similar
requests for information and we collect any information you may provide.
We collect information from you when you participate in sweepstakes,
games or other promotions offered on our Site. We may also collect
information about you through other methods, including research surveys
or information we obtain from third parties, including verification
services, data services, as well as public sources.
</p>
<p>
<strong>From All Users</strong><br>
Like most standard Website servers, we collect information from all
visitors to the Site. We collect this information using a variety of
methods, including weblogs, cookies, web beacons, widgets and the like.
The information we collect includes, but is not limited to, the browser
you are using, the internet address from which you linked to our Site,
the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the
computer you used to access our Site, and usage and browsing habits on
the Site.
</p>
<p>
Cookies we utilize on the Site may include session ID cookies,
persistent cookies, or more advanced technology such as HTML5 or Media
Stamp.  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A
persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of
time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided
in your Internet browser's "help" file. You may configure your browser
to prevent cookies from being set on your computer. If you reject
cookies you may still use the Site but your ability to use some areas of
the Site may be limited and you may not be able to use certain features
of the Site, including playing games or entering sweepstakes or
contests.
</p>
<p>
Similar cookies and other technologies are used by our advertising
partners, which may also include Flash cookies, which are a form of
persistent cookies technically called "Local Shared Objects" (LSOs).
Flash cookies are set through a mechanism in Adobe Flash Player. With
Flash cookies your data is stored in multiple places and it may be
restored once you delete it. Please check with your browser's site on
the most updated information on how to delete Flash cookies.  HTML5 or
Media Stamp technology has a local storage feature that, when used,
allows for quicker access to a website upon a return visit. HTML5 is
currently supported by some mobile devices and desktop browsers. HTML5
Media Stamp data is not stored in a browser's "cookies" file.
Our Site web pages and our e-mail newsletters contain web beacons (also
known as pixel tags). These web beacons allow us to count users who have
visited a web page or opened an email that contains a web beacon and
collect other types of information. Some of the web beacons that are in
place on our Site are used only by CafeMom, and other web beacons are
from our vendors and advertisers who use this data to assist us in
analyzing how our Members use the Site. In addition, we have agreements
with various affiliate networks that promote the Site on their affiliate
websites. These affiliate advertisers may use web beacons in their
advertisements to track users who click through from the affiliate
website to the Site.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the foregoing, the Site provides search functionality and
we collect the searches conducted on the Site by a user and may combine
that information with other information from such user.
</p>
<h2>III. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
<p>
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the information we collect that is
associated with a single user or Member, or combined in the aggregate is
known as "Data."  We keep Data no longer than necessary for legitimate
business purposes or as required by law.
</p>
<p>
General Use of Site.  We use the Date we collect, including both
Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") and non-PII in both
aggregated and individual forms, to provide the Site and Site support.
We may process and use this Data for purposes consistent with this
Privacy Policy including, but not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Customize, measure, and improve the Site design and optimization, and
the content and advertising provided through it, which include research
and development;
</li>
<li>
Enforce our Terms of Service and detect fraud and other illegal
activities;
</li>
<li>
Let you know about new products or services from us or other companies
we work with as well as promotional offers, based on your preference
settings;
</li>
<li>
Evaluate potential inclusion in the Site's influencer program;
</li>
<li>
Let you know about changes to the Site, the Terms of Service, this
Privacy Policy, and other terms that apply to our Site; and
</li>
<li>
Update any programs or other tools that we provide in conjunction with
the Site.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
We use this Data to create a better Site and better user experience, as
well as to help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, to
analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad
demographic information. We may use this Data in these forms for
internal business purposes, such as determining how much traffic certain
portions of the Site receive, for license reporting and assessment of
service levels, to better understand how the Site is used, to gauge
traffic patterns and determine what types of content and services are
most popular with users of the Site, or determining which search queries
are the most popular.
</p>
<p>
Using this Data, we are able to measure the effectiveness of our
advertising and how visitors use our Site. This allows us to learn what
pages are most attractive to our visitors, which parts of our Site are
the most interesting and what kind of offers our Members like to see.
We use cookies to differentiate users of the Site from Members, to
customize the content of certain sections of the Site and to enable us
to track and cater to the interests of users, in order to enhance their
experience on the Site. For example, we may use such Data to determine
which blogs, articles, or games to recommend to you. We may also use
Data we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other
communications.
</p>
<p>
We may use a Member's registration information to verify that you are
the person authorized to use the Site or to manage your account.
</p>
<p>
<strong>When You Register.</strong> When you register with CafeMom, you create your own
profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your
screen name and photo, are displayed as specified in your privacy
settings to allow you to connect with other CafeMom Members or to all
users of the Site. Your real name is never displayed on the Site (unless
you use it as your screen name), but your real name will be included in
emails that you "send to a friend." You can choose to allow Members and
non-Member users to search for you by using your real name or most other
information you have entered in your profile.
</p>
<p>
Most of the information you provide to CafeMom in your profile can be
set to be seen by all users of the Site, Members only, friends only, or
no one. However, please be aware that certain personal profile
information is displayed for all users and cannot be hidden.
Specifically, your screen name and photo are always displayed on the
Site and therefore are viewable by all users. In addition, because this
information is publicly displayed on the Site it may appear in the
results of searches conducted on Internet search engines.
</p>
<p>
By using the search functionality on the Site CafeMom Members can find
other moms with similar interests and challenges. When you find other
Members, you can view their personal profiles to find out more about
them based on the information they have decided to share on the Site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sharing of Information.</strong> We use third parties to assist us in delivering
parts of the Site to you. We may share portions of your Data with these
third parties to the extent necessary for them to provide these
services. As described in more detail below, we may also provide Non-PII
elements of your Data to third parties who deliver ads to you on our
behalf. We will not provide your PII to these advertisers unless you
expressly authorize us to do so.
</p>
<p>
We may also share weblog data and other similar non-PII Data with third
parties. For example, we may share traffic data for the Site with a
third party that analyzes and publishes Website traffic surveys.
</p>
<p>
Posts to the Site are viewable by either all users of the Site, Members
only, or group members only (as determined by the group owner). Note
that posts may also be collected by Internet search engines, such as
Google.
</p>
<p>
You may authorize other Internet sites such as Facebook to access and
publish on their websites some of your Data, including your activity on
the Site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Advertisements.</strong> We, or advertising network providers acting at our
request, may deliver advertisements to you through the Site, depending
on whether you are a registered user or not, as described in more detail
below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Non-Member Users</strong><br>
We, or our advertising providers, automatically deliver ads to all users
of the Site, whether they are registered or not, based on non-personal
information including: (i) the IP address associated with your computer
for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location; (ii)
the type of web page that is being displayed, such as a news or games
page, for example; or (iii) the content on the page that is shown, such
as a news article about a certain movie. This advertising activity
automatically applies to all users and it is purely contextual.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Members</strong><br>
If you are a Member, we may use your Data, regardless of where we
gathered such information, to determine what type of ad to display to
you on the Sites. In addition, we may send certain demographic
information, like ZIP code, age, and gender to our advertising network
providers, so that the advertising you see is more relevant to you.
These advertising network providers will only use such information to
display an ad to you on the Site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Ad Servers.</strong> We may use third party advertising technology to
serve ads when you visit our Site. We may from time to time use various
outside ad-serving companies to serve advertisements across the internet
and on our Site. They may collect anonymous information about your
visits to the Site and your interaction with our Service. They may also
use information about your visits to the Site and other websites to
target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information
is collected through the use of pixel tags or cookies, which are
industry standard technologies, used by most major websites. No
personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process
from our Site. If you would like more information about this practice
and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information
used by a third party service provider, please visit these sites:
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> and
<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sale of Business or Assets.</strong> In the event that CafeMom, substantially all
of its assets, or a line of business is sold or disposed of as a going
concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, or in the event
of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, PII and non-PII of our
Members may be one of the assets sold or merged in connection with that
transaction. Information about our Members may also need to be disclosed
in connection with a commercial transaction where CafeMom or an
affiliate, is seeking financing, investment, support or funding. In such
transactions, personal information will be subject to the promises made
in any pre-existing Privacy Policy in effect when the information was
obtained.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Photos, Videos, and Posts.</strong> As a CafeMom Member you can share personal
content. Please be aware that by using any of these features, your
personally identifiable information may be accessible to Members and
non-Members, and CafeMom has no control over how those users may use
your personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Monitoring.</strong> We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any
activity and content associated with the public and private forums,
including in-Site Member emails and interactive areas on our Site.
Please review our <a href="/about/tos.php">Terms of Service</a> for more information regarding your
appropriate use of these areas.
</p>
<p>
<strong>CafeMom Mobile.</strong> When you provide us with your mobile telephone number to
access certain features of CafeMom Mobile you agree that this action
constitutes a purchase, inquiry and/or application for purposes of
telemarketing laws. Regardless of the fact that your mobile telephone
number may be listed with the Federal Do-Not-Call Registry, or your
local State Do-Not-Call list, you expressly consent to receive future
information about CafeMom's programs and services from us, and in that
regard, you hereby consent to our contacting you pursuant to the
business relationship established using the information you provided to
us. This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by
e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of
automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of
communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may
be capable of receiving.
</p>
<p>
We'll send you our email and newsletters. CafeMom may send you
service-related announcements and emails from time to time. For
instance, if a friend sends you a message, you may receive an email
alerting you to that fact. We may also use your information to send you
e-newsletters, updates and communications about CafeMom. We may ask you
which newsletters you wish to receive. You may change your newsletter
preferences (i) at any time by simply updating your account, which you
can do by clicking on the "Privacy + Settings" button posted throughout
the Site, or (ii) by opting-out of receiving future emails as described
at the bottom of each communication from CafeMom.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sweepstakes and Promotions.</strong> On occasion, we offer sweepstakes and other
promotions in conjunction with a sponsor. By participating in a
promotion, you submit to that promotion's terms and conditions including
providing us with permission, if required, to share your personally
identifiable information with a particular sponsor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Offers.</strong> On occasion, we are able to offer you special
products or services through a relationship with a third party. In those
cases, the offer will be brought to you by CafeMom and fulfilled by the
third party. If you accept the offer, you will become a customer of the
company that is fulfilling the offer and we will not have control over
their use of the personally identifiable information that you provide to
them when you accept the offer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Invite a Friend.</strong> If you do become a Member, not only can you enjoy all
of the benefits of membership, but you can also invite other individuals
to join by providing us with their first names and email addresses.
Using the information you give us on these potential Members, we will
send them an email invitation to join CafeMom. The only way these
individuals can become Members, however, is if they come to our Site and
sign up themselves. We do not use this information for other purposes.

<p>
<strong>Legal Matters; Safety.</strong> We may, without your consent, access and disclose
your information, any communications sent or received by you, and any
other information that we may have about you or your account as may be
permitted or required by law (including, but not limited to, court order
or subpoena), or to prevent or investigate suspected fraud, violations
of our Terms of Service, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or
may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose your
information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving
potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property if we
believe that your information in any way relates to that threat.

<p>
</p><h2>IV. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES, PRACTICES AND CONTACT INFORMATION</h2>
<p>
CafeMom contains links to other sites. It is possible for you to receive
information directly from our partners and other companies if you access
them through a link on the Site or if you go directly to their Websites.
Once you are on their sites, any data that you supply to these partners,
for example, to obtain information or buy products directly from them,
is beyond our reach and will be the responsibility of each of the
linked-to entities and not CafeMom. We are not responsible for the
privacy practices or the content of these Websites or any other sites
linked to or referenced on our Site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Security.</strong> We have multiple layers of security on our systems. We have
implemented software and hardware security, including firewalls, data
encryption, and private networks intended to protect your personally
identifiable information from unauthorized access. We use firewalls and
intrusion-detection devices that are designed to defend against hackers
and notify us if any attempts are made to compromise our network. We
regularly review additional software upgrades to enhance our security
measures. However, despite our efforts, no system can completely
guaranty that there will never be unauthorized access to your personally
identifiable information, and your use of the Site indicates that you
are willing to assume this risk.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Your California Privacy Rights.</strong> Under California Civil Code sections
1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a
notice describing what categories of personal customer information we
share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties
or corporate affiliates' direct marketing purposes. That notice will
identify the categories of information shared and will include a list of
the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, along with
their names and addresses. If you are a California resident and would
like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the
address referenced below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>A Note to International Users.</strong> Our computer systems are currently based
in the United States, so your PII will be processed by us in the United
States, where data protection and privacy regulations may be different
than other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create
an online account to use the Site as a visitor from outside the United
States, you will have agreed to the terms of the Privacy Policy and our
Terms of Service and you will have consented to the transfer to and
processing of all such information in the United States, which many not
offer an equivalent level of protection of that in the European Union or
certain other countries.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Children's Privacy.</strong> CafeMom does not encourage participation or
visitation by children. Visitors who are known to be under the age of 16
are prohibited from becoming CafeMom Members. CafeMom does not knowingly
collect personally identifiable information from children under the age
of 16.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Updating Your Personal Information.</strong> If you are a CafeMom Member, you can
update your personally identifiable information at any time. To do this,
just click on the "Privacy + Settings" link listed throughout the Site.
However, we are unable to update or delete any of your personally
identifiable information that has been shared with a third party as
permitted in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Waiver.</strong> CAFEMOM ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY WITH REGARD TO
ANY THEFT, LOSS, ALTERATION OR MISUSE OF PERSONAL OR OTHER INFORMATION
LAWFULLY PROVIDED BY CAFEMOM TO THIRD PARTIES, OR WITH REGARD TO THE
FAILURE OF ANY THIRD PARTY TO ABIDE BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR AGREEMENT
BETWEEN THAT THIRD PARTY AND CAFEMOM.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy.</strong> We may change this Privacy Policy from
time to time. The most recent version of the Privacy Policy will always
be posted on the Site, with the "Effective Date" posted at the top of
the Policy. We may revise and update this Privacy Policy if our
practices change, as technology changes, or as we add new services or
change existing ones. If we make any material changes to our Privacy
Policy or how we handle your personal information, or we are going to
use any personal information in a manner that is materially different
from that stated in our Privacy Policy at the time we collected such
information, we will give you a reasonable opportunity to consent to the
change. If you do not consent, your personal information will be used as
agreed to under the terms of the privacy policy in effect at the time we
obtained that information. By using our Site or services after the
Effective Date, you are deemed to consent to our then-current privacy
policy. We will use information previously obtained in accordance with
the privacy policy in effect when the information was obtained from you.
