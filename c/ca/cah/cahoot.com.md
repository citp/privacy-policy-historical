## **location**

Where we do so we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal data receives similar protections as those within the European Economic Area.

## data protection statement 

In this statement, 'cahoot' means **cahoot** , a division of Abbey National plc. This statement relates to the information you give in the online application form and to any other information which you provide to cahoot or which it holds on you whether or not you become a customer.

**If your application is unsuccessful cahoot may pass your information to Loans.co.uk who may use this information to offer you alternative products and may make an additional search against a credit reference agency. By continuing with your application you are agreeing that we can pass all your information to Loans.co.uk.**

## credit assessment

**cahoot** may use your information for the purposes of determining whether you are eligible to open a cahoot account or to provide or increase any credit and, in particular, to carry out a credit assessment, which may include credit scoring, except for savings or savings and investment applications. **cahoot** may search the files of credit reference agencies which will keep a record of each search and make any other enquiries relating to you that it considers necessary (e.g. from another financial institution). Details about you and the conduct of your **cahoot account** will also be passed to credit reference agencies. An association between joint applicants or between yourself and any named partner/spouse will be created at the credit reference agency. This will link your financial records, each of which will be taken into account in all future applications by either or both of you. If an association already exists then your application will be assessed with reference to these associated records. This situation will continue until one of you successfully files a disassociation at the credit reference agency. 

Before opening your account, cahoot will check your details with fraud prevention agencies and may make searches at credit reference agencies who will supply cahoot with information, including information from the electoral register for the purpose of verifying your identity. Scoring methods may be used to verify your identity. The credit reference agencies will record details of the search whether or not the application proceeds but please note that this is not a credit check and will not be seen or used by lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit. If you give false or inaccurate information and fraud is suspected, cahoot will record this. 

**cahoot** and other organisations may use and search these records to help make decisions about credit and credit related services and insurance including motor, household, credit, life and other insurance proposals and claims for you and members of your household; trace debtors, recover debt, prevent money laundering and fraud, manage accounts and for statistical purposes.
