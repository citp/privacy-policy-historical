<p>The use of User Submitted Data is subject to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use (including any Site-specific Terms associated with a particular Service) in effect at the time we use such information. This section provides details about how CAQH gathers and uses User Submitted Data.</p>

<p><span><strong>(a)&nbsp;Cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Cookies are pieces of data assigned by a web server that uniquely identify the browser on your computer. CAQH may attempt to install cookies when a user arrives at any of our Sites or uses our Services. Cookies enable our systems to gather information about your navigational patterns through the Sites and Services. Viewers have the option to accept or disable cookies at any time through their browsers. Visit the “help” portion of your toolbar for more information. If you block or refuse to accept cookies, or delete cookies between visits to any of our Sites, you may not be able to access or use certain features or functions of our Sites or Services.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>(b) User Analytics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>We may collect general statistics to track user trends on our Sites and Services. These statistics may include hits to our server, the types of browsers used to access our Sites, page views, and navigational patterns. The information that is collected in this manner does NOT provide us with any Personal Information about our users. It helps us track “where” our users are coming from. This allows us to pinpoint high traffic areas and determine the most effective ways to communicate with our users. We may use this statistical information for research and commercial purposes and to develop improvements to our Sites and Services.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>(c)&nbsp;Information Users Provide to CAQH.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>We collect and store User Submitted Data when you register to use our Sites or Services, utilize the Services on our Sites, ask a question, complete a form, conduct a transaction, or send us an email. To use our Services, you will be required to submit certain User Submitted Data, including Personal Information. If you do not provide the requested information, you may not be able to access or use some of the features and functions of our Sites and we may not be able to provide you with our Services. For administrative and security purposes, such as to prevent the introduction of viruses and hackers into the CAQH site, we may collect and retain information, such as IP addresses.</span></p>

<p><span>We may use your User Submitted Data internally, among other things, to communicate with you, to provide information or Services to you, to contact you directly about Services that you have purchased, and for our research or business purposes.</span></p>

<p><span>We may also combine your User Submitted Data with Third Party Data to provide our Services.</span></p>

<p>Users who subscribe to certain of our Services will be required to provide certain User Submitted Data, including Personal Information that will be shared with other Users of the Services. The types of information collected through such Services include: &nbsp;</p>

<h2>3. &nbsp;WHAT SECURITY PROCEDURES DOES CAQH USE TO PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

<p>CAQH uses physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to assist us in preventing unauthorized access, maintaining data accuracy, and correctly using User Submitted Data. Information that is sent to us through our Sites and Services is secured by encryption. Because email transmissions are not secure, we encourage you to use encryption when sending us any User Submitted Data by email, or to use another means of transmitting the information to us.</p>

<p>Access to User Submitted Data through our Sites and Services is limited to registered persons who are required to use unique passwords to obtain access. We contractually prohibit these persons from using your User Submitted Data other than for the purpose of using our Services (unless otherwise authorized by you).</p>

<p><strong>(c)&nbsp;</strong><strong>Unaffiliated Third Parties.</strong>&nbsp; CAQH may from time to time disclose User Submitted Data to third parties as set forth in Section 4(h) below, and in connection with initiatives or activities consistent with our mission to simplify healthcare administration.&nbsp;</p>

If you are under the age of 18, please do not send us any information about yourself.</p>

<h2>7.&nbsp;DO NOT TRACK</h2>

<p>CAQH does not respond to web browser “do not track” signals. As such, your navigation of our Sites and use of the Service may be tracked as part of the gathering of the general User Analytics collected by CAQH. If you arrive at our Sites by way of a link from a third party site that does respond to “do not track” requests, the recognition of any “do not track” request you have initiated will end as soon as you reach our Sites.</p>

Your username and password or other authentication allows access to your information so you are responsible for the disclosure of your information to anyone using your username and password. Please protect these security devices and notify us immediately if they have been lost, stolen or misappropriated.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>9. UPDATING OUR POLICY</h2>
