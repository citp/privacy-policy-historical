              <li class="title">Introduction
				<ul><li>Careers Services maintains and hosts this web site, which is located at the URL careers.govt.nz and accessible through other URLs such as kiwicareers.govt.nz, careers.co.nz, kiwicareers.co.nz, and mahikiwi.govt.nz ("Site"). Any reference to "we" or "us" in this Privacy Statement refers to Careers Services.</li><li>The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to explain how we may collect personal information about you, and how we might use, disclose, store and deal with that personal information.</li></ul></li>
              <li>Collection of personal information
				<ul><li>By using the Site you are providing personal information to us.</li><li>There are 3 ways in which we may collect your personal information. These are explained below:
						<ol><li>User ID
								<ul><li>In order to access some parts of this Site, you will need to select a User ID and a password.</li><li>Your User ID may be any name you choose, and you may change it and your password at any time. The User ID you choose will determine whether or not you can be identified when you use this Site. For privacy reasons, we encourage you to select a User ID which is not your name. That way, it will be difficult to identify who you are, and may mean that we do not collect personal information about you in this way. However, if you use a User ID which is your actual name, this will mean that we may collect personal information about you.</li></ul></li><li>E-mails and Electronic Forms
								<ul><li>You may decide to provide us with your email address. If you do have an email address that might identify who you are, for example where your email address contains your name and where you work, remember that this is personal information when you are sending us emails or providing your email address to us.</li><li>You may also provide us with personal information by completing electronic forms that request personal details from you.</li></ul></li><li>Clickstream Data &amp; Cookies
								<ul><li>When you visit this Site our server makes a record of your visit and logs the following information:
										<ul class="disc"><li>your server address</li><li>your domain name</li><li>the time and date of your visit to the Site</li><li>the pages and documents you have accessed or viewed</li><li>the type of browser you are using</li></ul></li><li>Generally, this information will identify the computer you are using, rather than identifying you.</li><li>Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a small amount of information stored on your computer by our server. This information is sent by your web browser to our server whenever you visit it again. Cookies are used to remember your browser between page visits. However, the cookie identifies your browser, not you personally. No personal information is stored within the careers.govt.nz cookies.</li></ul></li></ol></li></ul></li>
              <li>How we use your personal information
				<ul><li>We will only use your personal information for the purpose for which you provided it to us, except as outlined in this section. The principal purpose for which your personal information will be used by us is to assist you with your career planning and to provide you with advice and information that we consider may be of assistance to you. If all or any part of the information requested from you is not supplied our advice or information may be of limited assistance to you.</li><li>We may use, reproduce, adapt, or retrieve your personal information for statistical purposes (eg to calculate how many people are using the Site). These statistics may be published, but not in a way which will identify any individual.</li><li>The reason we collect statistical information about the use of the Site (whether through cookies, or clickstream data, or through aggregating statistics about users) is that we need this information for:
						<ul class="disc"><li>website and system administration, including monitoring to prevent security breaches;</li><li>maintaining and improving the website;</li><li>reporting purposes;</li><li>research and development; and</li><li>to produce statistics about the traffic on the website.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
              <li>Recipient of your personal information
				<ul><li>The intended recipient of your personal information is Career Services, which is the agency that is collecting the information and that will hold the information for the purposes of the Privacy Act. You may contact us at the following address:</li><li>Career Services <i>rapuara</i><br>PO Box 9446<br>Wellington<br>New Zealand</li></ul></li>
              <li>How we disclose your information
				<ul><li>We will not disclose your personal information to any other person without your consent unless authorised or required by law.</li></ul></li>
              <li>Storage and Security of your Personal Information
				<ul><li>We take all reasonable steps to ensure that the information (including personal information) we hold in our servers is not subject to loss, misuse or unauthorised access or alteration. We will continue to hold your personal information but may delete your account and all personal information contained in this account if your account has been inactive for an extended period of time. If you wish us to destroy your personal information you can request us to remove your account from the <a href="/../default.aspx?id0=8&amp;id1=8008">Content Queries</a> page.</li><li>This Site does not, however, provide facilities for the secure transmission of information across the Internet. You should be aware that there are inherent risks associated with the transmission of personal information via the Internet.</li><li>You should also note that if you link to another website from this Site, a different privacy and security statement is likely to apply. Therefore, once you leave this Site, you should check the online privacy and security statements of the new website.</li><li>Please be aware that you should also protect the security of information you provide to this Site by not disclosing your User ID and password to any other person.</li></ul></li>
              <li>Access to and correction of your personal information
				<ul><li>In most cases, the Privacy Act gives you the right to gain access to personal information that we hold about you. All requests for access to your personal information will be handled by our privacy access officer, who can be contacted by writing to the address set out above. This is not, however, intended to cover requests for lost or forgotten passwords and is to be limited to genuine requests for the information which you have provided to this Site. In many cases you will also be able to directly access your personal information by logging into our Site using your username and password.</li><li>Generally, if you request us to do so we will amend any personal information about you held by us which is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date. You may also correct your personal information by logging into our Site using your username and password and correcting the relevant information. If we disagree with you about the accuracy, completeness or currency of a record of your personal information held by us, we will take reasonable steps to associate with that record a statement to the effect that you claim this to be the case, if you request us to do so.</li></ul></li>
              <li>Changes to this privacy statement
				<ul><li>We may make changes to this privacy statement from time to time, so you should check it each time you visit this Site.</li></ul></li>
