        <span class="black12">Career Dimensions, Inc is committed to protect your 
        privacy. We work diligently to protect confidentiality, restrict transfer 
        of personal data, incorporate technical safeguards and appropriate security 
        policies, and identify privacy implications in new services. To that end, 
        we would like you to know how we use the personal information you entrust 
        to us.</span></p>

            <p><span class="green12"><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION</strong></span><br>
        <span class="black12">Our web site may log a user's IP address, browser 
        type and version, dial-up domain, and computer operating system when he/she 
        visits our site. We use the tracked information to help diagnose problems 
        with our server and to administer our website. IP addresses of our web 
        site users are used to diagnose problems with our server, and to administer 
        our web site. IP addresses may also be used to gather broad demographic 
        information that is not associated with any individual. Our web sites use 
        an order form for customers to purchase our product and services. We collect 
        customers' contact information (such as their address and email address) 
        and financial information (such as credit card numbers). A valid certificate 
        for conducting Internet commerce has been issued by Verisign, Inc to Career 
        Dimensions, Inc. for this purpose. Contact information from the order 
        form is used to send confirmation of orders to our customers. We may also 
        provide future mailings regarding product information and releases. We 
        may conduct surveys during which similar information will be collected 
        and used for the same purposes listed above. Users may opt out of receiving 
        any of these at any time. We reserve the right to aggregate or compile 
        and use data obtained from the scoring of our assessments, and to utilize 
        this data for research, product development, and statistical analysis. 
        This data is only used in aggregate and never is associated with any individual's 
        identity.</span></p>
            <p><span class="green12"><strong>COOKIES</strong></span><br>
              <span class="black12">Our web site uses "cookies". Cookies 
              are small data files that certain web sites write to a user's hard 
              drive during a visit. A cookie file tracks information as the user 
              visits pages within the site. This information will be used to improve 
              the user's online experience by delivering content specific information 
              to the users. Users have the choice to accept, reject or be notified 
              when a site sets a cookie by configuring their browser preferences.</span></p>
            <p><span class="green12"><strong>SECURITY</strong></span><br>
              <span class="black12">When a user pays for an instrument or places 
              an order online, the user's personal information and credit card 
              information is processed and encrypted by offsite, secure servers 
              using industry-standard SSL encryption.</span></p>
            <p><span class="green12"><strong>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong></span><br>
              <span class="black12">We do not sell, trade or rent or otherwise 
              give to any other entity or organization the individual information 
              our customers submit when placing an order or taking an instrument 
              on our site. Career Dimensions Inc. may release account information 
              when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably 
              necessary to (i) comply with law; (ii) enforce or apply the terms 
              of any of our user agreements; or (iii) protect the rights, property 
              or safety of Career Dimensions, Inc., our users, or others.</span></p>
            <p><span class="green12"><strong>DATABASE ACCESS</strong></span><br>
        <span class="black12">Institutional and corporate customers who purchase 
        blocks of usage are provided with an institutional interface for managing 
        their users and running reports. This institutional database allows for 
        adding, editing, deleting, and accessing the results of user's assessments. 
        Access to this tool is granted solely to the administrator responsible 
        for that institution or corporation and their assignees. Career Dimensions,
