They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by the Data Protection Act. 
  * **Promotional offers:** sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Cars Ireland users on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give them your name or address.
