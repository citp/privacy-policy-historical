**GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY**  
Thank you for visiting the CarMax website. We hope that you find our website to be a useful part of your car-buying experience. Please note that this General Privacy Policy describes our overall privacy practices for the website. Section II applies to California users. Section III is our privacy policy for nonpublic personal information used in the provision of financial services. 

If any information we have about you is incorrect, we will gladly correct it. Simply [Email](mailto:optout@carmax.com) us noting the incorrect information and the correction. We reserve the right to verify the correctness of this information. Please note that in the event we amend the Privacy Policy, posting the amended version will serve as notice to you of that change and the policy will note its effective date. 

Some information collected is non-identifying. For example, although our site servers collect information about a user’s internet protocol address, our server is not able to automatically associate that information with a particular user. We may collect non-identifying information associated with that address, such as the time and date of a visit, the originating domain name, the browser type, and the particular pages or products viewed on the site. 

CarMax may utilize a “cookie.” A “cookie” is a small text file that a website can place on your computer’s hard drive in order to collect information about your activities on the website. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you have the option to change your browser to decline them. We use cookies on certain pages of our websites, but these cookies are not used to identify anonymous site visitors. Our cookies enable you to proceed smoothly through our sites and enable us to know whether you’ve visited our sites before to eliminate some steps that are directed to new visitors. Similarly, a cookie may be placed by our third-party advertising companies. These companies may use aggregated statistics about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide you with advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. The information they collect does not include your personal information. 

Image tags work in conjunction with cookies. An image tag, also referred to as a clear GIF or web beacon, is a small image file that may be located on select pages on our websites. 

The third-party advertising companies may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of ads. Any such information is anonymous. They may use this anonymous information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. No personal information about you is collected during this process. The information is anonymous and does not link online actions to an identifiable person. If you would like more information and want to explore the option of not having this information collected by third-party advertisers [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). 

At this time, CarMax has contracted with Omniture, TruEffect and Google to collect information about how website users navigate our websites. This information will not be disclosed and will be used only to generate anonymous visitor profiles, which do not contain personally identifiable information. The anonymous profiles are used to provide website users content specifically tailored to them.

With respect to unrelated, third party web sites, such as third party online retailers, advertisers, or unrelated sites that we may happen to link to, or web sites that link to our website, those third parties may collect personal information directly from you. The information policies and practices of these unrelated parties are not covered by this privacy policy. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties even if we may provide hyperlinks or other access to their web sites. We are not responsible or liable for their independent policies and practices. Please review their privacy policies and practices. It is your responsibility to review them and decide if you are satisfied with their protections. 

We collect certain personally identifying information that users voluntarily provide to use. For example, we collect the email addresses of those who contact us by email. We also collect information that you may voluntarily provide to us in surveys or by filling out a website registration form. As described above, we use that information to serve you, to improve the content of our site, and to contact you for marketing purposes. **As a reminder, if you provide personal information to us for the purposes of a financial service, the please see Section III for the applicable privacy policy.**

We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the information we collect online. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We do not provide an absolute guarantee of the security of our information databases, nor do we guarantee that the information you may choose to supply will not be intercepted while you transmit it from your computer, over the internet, or along other third party networks, and to our systems. However, with respect to security: when we intend to transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information, such as financial information, we redirect visitors to a secure server using, for example, Transport Layer Security or Secure Sockets Layer security.
