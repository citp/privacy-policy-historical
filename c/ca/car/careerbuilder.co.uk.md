For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, this company is the “data controller” in respect of personal information that we obtain in connection with the Site.

**Making Changes to Your Information or Preferences**

To review, correct, update, change or delete your CareerBuilder UK account profile information or CV at any time, log into your My CareerBuilder account, go to your Account Profile or CV, review your account information or CV and, if you wish, edit or delete it with the options provided (please note that CareerBuilder UK may retain records of your previous account profiles, which will not be accessible by third parties, for audit and recordkeeping purposes). If, at the time of registration or on some other occasion, you have opted into receiving commercial emails or other communications from CareerBuilder UK, you can use this method to opt out of such receipt. Conversely, if you should change your mind and decide that you would prefer to receive such emails from CareerBuilder UK, you can use this method to opt into receipt.

**Web Beacons**

CareerBuilder UK web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information on CareerBuilder UK and cannot be used by third parties; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our web site usage.

Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. Because web beacons are the same as any other content request included in the recipe page, you cannot opt out or refuse them. However, they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or changing the cookie setup in your browser. 

**About Cookies**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that track your on-line movements. At CareerBuilder UK, we use cookies only for the protection and convenience of our users. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly. If a user's system is idle for more than an hour, however, the cookie will expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This helps to prevent unauthorized access to the user's information while they are away from their computer. Your browser should tell you how to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however, some Site features or services may not function properly without cookies.

Third-Party Cookies: In the course of serving advertisements to the Site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. CareerBuilder UK is not responsible for such third party use of cookies.

**Security for your Personal Information**

CareerBuilder UK has taken considerable steps to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure. As part of this process, we have encrypted all account and password data. In addition, we employ encryption for secure credit card transactions. Although we have taken all reasonable steps, there is no such thing as infallible security. Thus, we cannot guarantee that your personal information will not be subject to unauthorised access.
