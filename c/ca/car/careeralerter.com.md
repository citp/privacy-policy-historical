To the extent you upload a resume, Career Alerter may make the resume and other personal information contained therein available to third parties, including but not limited to employers and search engines.

Career Alerter reserves the right to disclose any information as required by law. 

We may use other companies as necessary to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Every effort will be made to safeguard your privacy when it may be accessed by other companies, including but not limited to technology providers; however, Career Alerter will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies.

#### Protect Yourself

Career Alerter uses automated processes and third party aggregators to collect and present information that has been created by third parties, so we cannot verify the accuracy or legitimacy of all job postings displayed on our site.

Never provide your social security number, credit card information, bank account details, or unnecessary personal information to a potential employer. Never participate in a financial transaction of any sort with a potential employer. Always be cautions of opportunities that sound too good to be true or require you to act as a financial intermediary, particularly for an overseas person.
