### 1\. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Cardinal Health, Inc. and its affiliates collects and uses your information.

Our Privacy Policy applies to all who visit and use our website, cardinalhealth.com, and online services as well as the websites and online services offered by our affiliates (collectively the “Site”).  Affiliates are those entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, by Cardinal Health, or that are controlled by or under common control with Cardinal Health.  References in this Privacy Policy to “Cardinal Health,” “we,” “our” or “us” are references to the entity that is responsible for the collection and use of your personal data, which is generally the entity that obtains your personal data in the respective case.  This entity also is referred to as the data controller.

This Privacy Policy excludes those websites and online services operated by Cardinal Health or our affiliates that have separate privacy policies and do not link to this Privacy Policy or incorporate it by reference.  Different privacy policies also may apply to other parts of Cardinal Health’s web presence – for example, password protected areas or web pages for online recruitment.  Our Privacy Policy applies only to activities we engage in on the Site and does not apply to activities that are “offline” or unrelated to the Site.

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/en/support/terms-and-conditions-english.html), also which apply when you use our Site.  By using the Site and by providing your personal data and other information through the Site, you acknowledge that your personal data will be processed pursuant to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree with the practices described in this Privacy Policy, please do not provide us with your personal data or otherwise interact with the Site.

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time.  If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will provide notice on this Site prior to the changes becoming effective. You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the date it was “Last Updated” above.
