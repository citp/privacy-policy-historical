We use the information to respond to your requests, handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services and promotional offers, develop new product & services for you, update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us, display content such as Liked Products and customer reviews and recommend products and services that might be of interest to you. We also use this information to improve our service, store and platform, to enable you to enjoy more variety of services provided, prevent or detect fraud, abuses of our website or any other illegal activities when using our services and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.

### Here are the types of information we gather:

##### Information You Give Us:

We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. See **“Information You Give Us”** under the **“Examples of Information Collected”** section further down the page for examples. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.

##### Automatic Information:

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use “cookies”, and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses **Car From Japan** or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of **Car From Japan** on other websites. See **“Automatic Information”** under the **“Examples of Information Collected”** section further down the page for examples.

##### Mobile:

When you download or use apps created by **Car From Japan** , we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as popular products, advertising, search results, and other personalized content. For more information about how to do this, see the “Mobile” section further down the page.

##### E-mail Communications:

To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from **Car From Japan** if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your **Car From Japan** **Contact method preference.**

##### Information from Other Sources:

We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. See “Information from Other Sources” under the “Examples of Information Collected” section further down the page for examples.

### What about cookies?

Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide features such as easy purchasing, recommendations, and personalized advertisements on other Web sites (e.g., **Car From Japan** Associates with content served by **Car From Japan** ).

The help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of **Car From Japan** ’s essential features, we recommend that you leave them enabled. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to send inquiry, process a purchase, or use any of **Car From Japan** ’s products and services that require you to sign in.

#### Does **Car From Japan** share the information it receives?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share (i.e. jointly use) customer information, for such purposes as aforementioned, with **Car From Japan** Co., Ltd., and its affiliates, that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.

#### Affiliated Businesses that We Do Not Control:

We work closely with affiliated businesses. In some cases, these businesses operate stores at **Car From Japan** or sell offerings to you at **Car From Japan**. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share (i.e. jointly use) or transfer customer information related to those transactions with or to that third-party pursuant to the requirements of Japanese laws.

#### Third-Party Service Providers:

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, shipping, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

#### Promotional Offers:

Sometimes, we send offers to selected groups of customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer Contact method preference.

#### Business Transfers:

As we continue to develop our business, **Car From Japan** might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that **Car From Japan** or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

#### Protection of **Car From Japan** and Others:

We release account and other personal information subject to the requirements by applicable law when we determine release is appropriate to comply with the requirements of laws or public institutions; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of **Car From Japan** , our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, piracy protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.

#### With Your Consent:

Other than as set out above, you will receive a notice when information about you might go to third parties, in order to provide you an opportunity to choose not to have your information transferred.

#### How Secure is Information about Me?

Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.

We implement a variety of security measures when a user places an order, enters, submits, or accesses their information.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be e to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

#### What about Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies.

You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the “What Information Can I Access?” section on this page. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.

Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.
