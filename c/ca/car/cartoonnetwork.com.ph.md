# Cartoon Network - Privacy Policy

PRIVACY POLICY

Cartoon Network is fully committed to providing a fun, entertaining and safe web site for people of all ages. Because we want our audience to feel comfortable exploring the content offered on [CartoonNetwork.com.ph](http://www.cartoonnetwork.com.ph/), this Online Privacy Policy outlines and clarifies how we collect and use information online, our advertising policies and the safeguards we recommend to ensure a fun and safe web experience. As new technology and online standards evolve, we may modify these policies to better address your concerns. 

Data Collection

[CartoonNetwork.com.ph](http://www.cartoonnetwork.com.ph/) does not collect any personally identifiable information from its visitors without the person being aware that they are providing the information. Instead, personal information, such as names and email addresses, is obtained only during the registration process and when visitors fill out contest entry forms, subscribe to newsletters, contact us via email or otherwise voluntarily provide this information to us. We may use or disclose personal information if we reasonably believe that the use or disclosure is necessary to prevent improper conduct or a breach of law or if its use or disclosure is required or authorised by law. In all other circumstances, we will use personally identifiable information only for the purpose for which it is provided. Under no circumstances will we sell or otherwise disclose personal information to any third party. We make all reasonable efforts to give notice via email to parents of children under the age of 13 when we collect information (email addresses or any other information) from their child. For visitors over 13 years of age, we may collect information, with your permission, that will be used to improve your experience on [CartoonNetwork.com.ph](http://www.cartoonnetwork.com.ph/) (e.g., online surveys). You may ask us at any time to disclose to you the personal information that we have collected from you. On your request, we will amend any such information that is incorrect. 

Sweepstakes and Contests

[CartoonNetwork.com.ph](http://www.cartoonnetwork.com.ph/) strives to create imaginative online contests or promotions. We do this because, well, it's fun. However, before entering a Cartoon Network contest online, we require kids to ask a parent for permission. Children under 13 years of age are required to enter their parent's email address as well. This is done so that we may contact a parent via email to notify them that their child has entered a Cartoon Network contest and to give them the option of removing the child's email address from the list of entries. Cartoon Network will not use a parent's email address for any other purpose. Cartoon Network will remove a parent's or their child's details from our database within 72 hours of any request from that parent. Sometimes we may also require a visitor to provide us additional information that is not personally identifiable. For example, we might ask you to tell us your favourite character or answer a trivia question. 

Once a contest winner has been selected, that person will be notified via the winner's postal address given at the time of entry. Cartoon Network will not be responsible for invalid postal addresses. 

Voluntary Submissions via Email

Cartoon Network enjoys interacting with its audience. Therefore, there will be opportunities for visitors to contact us online. In these areas, an email address will be collected, and in some cases, you may receive a response. 

In addition, sometimes you will have the choice to select the option to subscribe to a free online newsletter sent to the email address you provide. The newsletter will have fun, informative updates about [CartoonNetwork.com.ph](http://www.cartoonnetwork.com.ph/). When a child under 13 years of age requests this newsletter, we collect their email address as well as their parent's email address. A notification will be sent to the parent informing them that the child has requested a free newsletter that will be sent to the child's email account. The parent can request at any time, through the options described in the notification, how to delete their child's email address from the newsletter subscription list. In addition, each time the newsletter is emailed, directions will clearly be stated how to remove oneself from the email newsletter list. 

Under no circumstances will your email address be provided to any third parties. 

Cookies: the non-edible kind

Cookies are tiny pieces of information that your browser stores on your computer, such as what browser you're using or what operating system you use. 

At [CartoonNetwork.com.ph](http://www.cartoonnetwork.com.ph/), we use cookies to help make your experience better and understand how well we're doing. We only use cookies so that we know how many visitors we have and how often they visit: that's the best way to know if you like what we're doing. Under no circumstances do we use cookies to collect or cross-relate personal information about you. 

Safeguards - Monitor Your Child's Internet Usage

As we have taken special precautions to aid in the safety of your child's World Wide Web experience, we ask parents to monitor closely the Internet activities of their children and become educated on the various Internet and software tools available so as to ensure that their child has a fun and satisfying on-line experience.
