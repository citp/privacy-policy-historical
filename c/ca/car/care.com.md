**Information We Collect**  
Care.com is committed to helping match users who are seeking home or care services ("Care Seekers") to users who are providers of home or care services ("Care Providers"). Accordingly, we collect user submitted personally identifying information and other information specific to the services requested or provided. As part of providing you our services, we may obtain personal information from the following sources:

  * Information you provide to us on forms that you enter on the Site or that you provide to us in writing.
  * Information that you provide to us by telephone, such as when you contact our customer care department.
  * Information we receive automatically when you visit our web site. Please see "Cookies and other Technical Data" below.
  * Information from third parties, including verification services, payment processing services, and other online and offline sources. For example, this would include information we receive from a third-party verification service in response to a user requesting a background check on themselves. It would also include updated address or contact information that we might use to correct our records so that we can communicate with you more easily.



The information we collect may include: first name, last name, city, state, address, ZIP code, phone, email address and other information specific to the service requested or provided. If you become a registered subscriber we may collect your credit card information and billing address should you explicitly decide to participate in programs that require this information. Such programs may include becoming a Premium subscriber, running a background check, posting a job as a company recruiter, and other promotions that Care.com may offer from time to time. If you become a registered Care Provider, we may collect your date of birth, gender, resume, company name (if applicable), and ZIP codes served. If you are a company or agency registering as a Care Provider, we may also collect information about the company including the tax id, the year established, and the number of employees. If you request a background check on yourself we may collect your Social Security Number. In addition, if you request a background check on yourself we may obtain criminal background information from a third-party verification service. Use of such a verification service is voluntary.

We may also collect information about third-party references from Care Providers. This information may include the name, phone number, and email address of the third-party reference. This information is collected when a Care Provider creates or updates their profile. This information is collected so that a Care Seeker or Care.com acting on behalf of a Care Seeker can contact the third-party reference to verify information provided by the Care Provider. The information collected about third-party references will not be used for other purposes including marketing. If a third-party reference would like to have their information removed from Care.com, they can [contact Care.com Member Care](https://www.care.com/contact-us-p1011.html) .

If you use our blog on this Site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

We use the information we obtain to develop and deliver our services and to fulfill legal requirements. We limit the collection and use of customer information to the minimum we require to deliver superior service to our customers and to administer our business.
