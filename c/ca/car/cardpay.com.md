## How we protect and store personal information

Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.

We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.

## How we share personal information with other CardPay Inc. users

To process your payments, we need to share some of your personal information with the person or company that you are paying or who is paying you. Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received from verified CardPay Inc. users, and whether you have verified control of a bank account are provided to other CardPay Inc. users whom you transact with through CardPay Inc..

We work with third parties, including merchants to enable them to accept or facilitate payments from or to you using CardPay Inc. In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number, when a payment is sent to you or, when you attempt to pay that merchant or through that third party. We use this information to confirm to that you are a CardPay Inc. customer and that CardPay Inc. as a form of payment can be enabled, or where a payment is sent to you to send you notification that you have received a payment.

Regardless, we will not disclose your credit card number or bank account number to anyone you have paid or who has paid you through CardPay Inc. or with the third parties that offer or use the CardPay Inc. Services, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with credit card association rules, a valid regulatory or law enforcement request, or, to cooperate in an ongoing law enforcement investigation, as otherwise required by law.

## How we share personal information with other parties

Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
  * Companies that we plan to merge with or may be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice). 
  * Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when: 
    * we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure,
    * we need to do so to comply with law or credit card association rules
    * we are cooperating with an ongoing law enforcement investigation,
    * we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our User Agreement.
