Personal Information provided to us by you will be made available for joint use by duly authorised CARTIER personnel both in the USA and in France, its subsidiary and affiliated companies worldwide, its Customer Relations management agencies and occasionally to other persons or companies who carry out operations in relation to our business such as data cleansing and joint marketing operations. Our subsidiaries and some of our business partners are located outside of the USA and France and consequently you accept that your Personal Information may be either imported to or transferred abroad. However, all such persons/companies are subject to confidentiality agreements and to the strict respect of your privacy in accordance with applicable legislation.

CARTIER will use its best endeavours to ensure that your Personal Information is kept secure at all times.

Because our database is in France, it has been registered for automatic processing of data of a personal nature with the French Data authorities – CNIL, registration No. 1098236.

On request, CARTIER will remove your Personal Information from its database thereby cancelling your registration to any of the CARTIER services. You are also advised that upon written request you may inspect your Personal Information and/or request that information about you be corrected, amended or deleted.
