### Our Privacy Policy

_Last updated: Aug 9, 2017_

This privacy policy describes the personal information that we, Carter’s, Inc., and our subsidiaries and brands, which include Carter’s and OshKosh B’Gosh (collectively, “Carter’s,” “we,” “us” and “our”) collect about you, why we collect it, how we use it, and when we share it with third parties. 

This privacy policy covers our U.S. stores and online experiences including our websites. Our policy also describes the choices you can make about how we collect and use your information. 

#### Our Policy

If our information practices change, we will post an updated policy on our website. You can tell if the policy has changed by checking the “last reviewed” date that appears above. In the case of any substantive changes that affect how we handle or share personally identifiable information, we will give notice of the changes by posting the amended policy on the websites at least thirty days before the effective date of the change. If you have provided us with your email address, we will also notify you of any such substantive change by sending an email at least thirty days before the effective date of the change to the email address you most recently provided to us. We encourage you to keep the email address you provide to us current, and to promptly notify us of any changes to your email address, so that you may receive any notices we send to you regarding substantive changes to this privacy policy. If you do not agree to the new terms, you should stop using the websites or otherwise providing information to us. Otherwise, the new terms will take effect after thirty days.

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please contact us as described in the section entitled, “How do I contact you?” below.
