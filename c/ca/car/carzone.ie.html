Carzone.ie allows users to search advertisements posted on Carzone.ie for new and used vehicles ("<strong>Vehicles</strong>").  Carzone.ie also allows users, both private sellers and professional trade advertisers to register with Carzone.ie ("<strong>Advertisers</strong>"), and to place advertisements for the sale of Vehicles. </p>

<p>1.2 1.2	This policy, together with our <a href="http://www.carzone.ie/index.cfm?fuseaction=TermsConditions">Terms and Conditions</a> and any other documents referred to in them, set out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.  Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION ON CARZONE.IE</strong> </p>

<p>2.1 You can browse Carzone.ie without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.</p>

<p>2.2 When registering as an Advertiser, responding to an advertisement via Carzone.ie or during your time as an Advertiser or user of Carzone.ie you may be asked to provide information to us.  We will inform you at the time of collecting information from you whether you must provide the information to use Carzone.ie or a particular Carzone.ie service, or whether the provision of information requested by us is optional.  By agreeing to this Policy you agree that we have informed you at the time of collecting information from you whether the information that you may provide to us will be accessible to other users of Carzone.ie, other Advertisers or by third parties so that you are in a position to take an informed decision on whether to provide the information to us.</p>

<p>2.3 We may collect and process the following data about you: </p>
	<ul style="list-style:none;">
		<li>2.3.1	if you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence;<br><br></li>
		<li>2.3.2	information that you submit in response to an advertisement or when communicating with an Advertiser; <br><br></li>
		<li>2.3.3	in order to register as an Advertiser, we will require you to supply your name, email address, contact telephone number, and postal address; <br><br></li>
		<li>2.3.4	in order to ensure the information supplied to us is held securely we may occasionally request proof of identity before allowing access to your personal information;<br><br></li>

<p>3.1 Advertisers partake in Carzone.ie by placing advertisements for Vehicles for sale. Advertisers are able to manage, change, and remove the advertisements submitted to Carzone.ie Service through 'My Adverts'.  Advertisers need personal login details to access 'My Adverts', which will have been supplied to them on completion of registration with Carzone.ie.</p>

<p>3.2	Advertisements contain information relating to Vehicles and also limited personal information about Advertisers which Advertisers provide to us.

<p>3.3	We require Carzone.ie users responding to Advertisements via Carzone.ie to provide their name, email address, comments addressed to the Advertiser and (optionally) a telephone number to us.  Then we email the Advertiser on their behalf, and give the Advertiser this information.

<p>3.4	Separately, Carzone.ie users can contact the Advertiser directly via an "email the seller" button on Carzone.ie which allows the Carzone.ie user to send the Advertiser a message via Carzone.ie directly. You agree to only contact an Advertiser using Carzone.ie or using information that we give to you for the purposes of dealing with the Advertiser's Advertisement, unless the Carzone.ie user separately agrees with the Advertiser</p>

</li>


<li><p><b>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION TO OTHER PEOPLE</b></p>

<p>4.1	We do not disclose to any third party personal information that you provide to us unless we have your permission or we believe the law permits or requires it.</p>

<p>4.2	If you provide personal information to us you understand and agree that we may disclose your personal information to the following third parties:</p>

	<ul style="list-style:none;">
		<li>4.2.1	to the Carzone.ie hosting provider Telecity, Kilburn House, Lloyd St North, Manchester M15 6SE, UK and Getronics UK Limited Howard Pincock, The Babbage Centre, The Heath Business &amp; Technology Park, Runcorn, WA7 4QX, UNITED KINGDOM. You acknowledge that we may change the hosting provider at any time and any such change will be posted on Carzone.ie by an amendment to this Privacy Policy. You consent to the transfer of your personal data to any new hosting provider's servers. You may communicate any questions, comments or requests in relation to any change in hosting provider by emailing  <a href="mailto:classifieds@carzone.ie">classifieds@carzone.ie</a> or by post to Auto Trader Limited, Paramount Court, Corrig Road, Sandyford, Dublin 18.<br>
		  <br></li>
		<li>4.2.2	any member of our group of companies, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries;<br><br></li>
		<li>4.2.3	to Auto Trader Group Limited;<br><br></li>
		<li>4.2.4	to the prospective seller or buyer of any business or assets related to Carzone.ie or all or part of Auto Trader Limited or any other member of our group of companies;<br><br></li>
		<li>4.2.5	to a third party if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data with that third party in order to comply with any legal obligation, fraud investigation or in order to enforce or apply our <a href="http://www.carzone.ie/index.cfm?fuseaction=TermsConditions">terms of use</a> and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our group of companies, Carzone.ie, our customers, other registered users or others. This includes exchanging information with third parties such as the Gardai Siochana and/or the Consumer Protection Commission amongst others, for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction in alignment with Section 8 of the Data Protection Act (1988).</li>
	</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.3	While we do not disclose your name to third party vehicle record checking service providers, when you ask us to check registration details of your vehicle or where we think it is prudent to do so, we may send limited details such as your vehicle's registration number to these services providers, including Auto Records t/a Cartell.ie.</p>

<p>4.4	Where legally required to do so we will notify you when information about you may be provided to third parties in ways other than explained in this policy.</p>

<p>4.5	We do not disclose personal information about you to third parties (including advertisers or marketing companies), but we may provide them with aggregate anonymised information about Carzone.ie users. For example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement displayed on Carzone.ie on any given day, or we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit Carzone.ie. We may also use such aggregate anonymised information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in the southeast of Ireland) when displaying advertisements on our website. We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience. You agree to these practices.</p>

<p>4.6	It may be necessary to transfer your personal information to other group companies or service providers located in countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). This may happen where our servers or suppliers and service providers are based outside of the EEA or where you use our services and products while visiting countries outside of the EEA. The data protection and other laws of these countries may not be as comprehensive as those in Ireland or the EU but in these instances we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights are respected. You agree that we may transfer your personal data on that basis.</p>
</li>


<li><p><b>MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS</b></p>

<p>5.1  When you register with our Website, we ask you whether you would like to receive our communications detailing offers, news and services from Carzone.ie and/ or information from third party companies via email that we feel may be of interest to you. In order to receive these communications, you will need to opt in during registration.</p>

<p>5.2  On occasions Carzone.ie runs promotions in which personal information is collected. We will always ask you if you agree to this and advise you if this information may be shared with a third party. You will always be asked to provide your consent to this use by opting in.</p>
