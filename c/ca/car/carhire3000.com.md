# Car Hire with discount rates from Car Hire 3000

CARHIRE 3000 takes the privacy of the information you give us very seriously. Any information you give us will be used in accordance with the UK data protection act of 1998 and The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. This policy explains how your information is used, and how we protect your privacy.

 **Booking Information**  
When you book with us we need to know your name, address, telephone number, credit or debit card number and expiry date. We also need the drivers' age to enable us to process the booking. As a booking agent CARHIRE 3000 passes on essential booking details to our car rental partners in order to confirm your booking. 

**Promotional updates**  
You may choose to subscribe to our Special Offers service in order to receive e-mails notifying you of any promotions or new services we are offering. You can opt out of this service at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in any e-mails we send to you . We use the services of a data mailing provider to facilitate the dispatch of promotional e-mails and postal updates to you. We ensure that this provider keeps your personal information confidential and secure at all times. 

**Competitions and promotions**   
From time to time we may run competitions and promotions, and ask for your name, address and e-mail address in order to administer them and notify the winners. We will only use the information for these purposes unless you actively opt to receive additional information of a marketing nature. We may also ask you to give us your opinion on a subject, submit recommendations, or give us information to help develop our customer profile. We may publish these results on our site but we will not publish your name or comment without your permission. 

**Site tracking**   
We use tracking software to monitor the visitors to our site and to help us to improve the design and content of the site. This software captures and measures such information as page views and site usage patterns using a cookie system. Cookies are small text files which are sent to your web browser and are stored on the hard drive in your computer. Your browser settings can be set to inform you before receiving a cookie and/or block them. 

**Phone call tracking**   
To help us improve our service to you we record phone calls made to us for training and quality purposes. 

**Disclosure to third parties**   
CARHIRE 3000 never discloses personal information about its customers to third parties without prior consent, except in the case of an emergency or if we are legally obliged to do so. We will not sell or rent any personally identifiable information we receive from you.  
CARHIRE 3000 may provide statistics about our customers, sales and booking patterns and related information to third parties, but these will not contain any personally identifying information. 

**Your consent**   
By using this web site you consent to the collection, storage and use of this information by CARHIRE 3000 as set out in our privacy policy. In the event that we change our privacy policy, we will post any changes on this page, so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.   
Please note that the information you provide for your booking will be transferred outside the European economic area if your rental takes place outside of this area. By submitting your order, you consent to this transfer. 

**Secure Transactions  
** CARHIRE 3000 is committed to ensuring that the information you provide in making a booking is secure. To do so we use SSL (secure socket layer) technology the recognised industry standard. This encrypts all your personal information including your credit card details, so that it cannot be read as it is sent over the internet. Once your transaction has been completed, your personal information is stored on a secure computer, not on the web server, so it cannot be accessed through the internet. To verify that your browser is using the secure server look for a small padlock icon on the lower part of your browser window. If it is shown in the 'locked' position, your transaction is secure.

**Cookies**  
The CARHIRE 3000 web site does make limited use of cookies to better serve you. However, we do not store any personal or credit card information about you in these cookies. They do contain a session id number and some other basic information about your visit (for instance, which country you chose when you came to the site).
