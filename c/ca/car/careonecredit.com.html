        <h2>DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY WHEN I LINK TO OTHER WEBSITES?</h2>
        <p>This Website contains links to other Websites not owned or operated by us (for example, if you "click" on a Counselor link, you will likely be taken off our Website). We will attempt to make it obvious to you when you leave our Website and enter these Websites by opening a new browser or otherwise notifying you that you are leaving our Website. However, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such Websites. We encourage you to be aware when our Website links to other Websites and to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every Website.

        <a id="en" name="secureWeb"></a>
        <h2>IS THE INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THIS WEBSITE SECURE?</h2>
        <p>We want your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to remain as secure as possible. We strive to provide secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers through industry-standard techniques. To help ensure the integrity and privacy of the Personally Identifiable Information you provide via the Internet, we use Secured Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in transmitting such Personally Identifiable Information over the Internet to our servers. We secure the Personally Identifiable Information you provide on servers located in controlled, secure environments, protected from unauthorized access, use, or alteration. Only employees who need access to your information to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such information. No personal data is ever stored on our web servers. Sensitive information is encrypted within our database, to ensure internal security. In addition, all of our employees must abide by this Privacy Policy and are kept up-to-date on security practices. Any employee who violates this Privacy Policy is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the above commitments to protect your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) from loss, misuse or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
        
        <h2>WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING THE COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>You may "opt out" of sharing your Personally Identifiable Information with affiliated and non-affiliated companies as explained in the Privacy Notices of the CCA’s. To review the full Privacy Notice of each CCA for all of the details and directions on how to "opt out" click here. </p>
        <p>Persels &amp; Associates does not divulge your Personally Identifiable Information to anyone without your consent, except in very limited circumstances that require an attorney to divulge confidential information.  In most jurisdictions, this is limited to a reasonable belief by the attorney that his or her client is about to commit an act that will result in death or serious bodily injury to another human being.

        <h2>CAN I CORRECT MY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>You can always contact 3Ci to update, correct or delete your Personally Identifiable Information or change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us by calling Customer Services at 1-800-699-5688.

        <p>Current customers of the Counselors with online access to their Services can view, update or change their personal, contact and occupational information by selecting the Member Login navigation link off the Website home page, or by contacting Customer Service at 1-800-699-5688. You may also change your debt or budget information by contacting Customer Service as well.</p>
        <p>You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided from our system. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your Personally Identifiable Information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible to locate. 3Ci promises that promptly after receiving your request, all Personally Identifiable Information stored in marketing databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as reasonably practicable. </p>
        
        <h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
        <p>While our Privacy Policy would cover all prospective Users, the Counselors only assist residents of the United States. Clients must have an US bank account and a US residence and each client’s debts must be payable in US currency. </p>
        
        <h2>WEB BEACONS</h2>
        <p>Our Web pages contain electronic images (called a "single-pixel gif" or "Web beacon") that allow us to count page views. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page, including an ad banner, can act as a Web beacon. Web beacons are typically very small, 1 by 1 pixel size, banner like files, but their presence can be easily seen within Internet Explorer by clicking on "View" and then on "Source". Web beacons are so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content. A web beacon or cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personally Identifiable Information you submit while on our site.</p>
        <p>We also partner with third parties who use Web beacons on our site to optimize their ad-serving engine by re-marketing to users who have visited our site. They do not link their web beacons to any Personally Identifiable Information submitted on our site.</p>
        <p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.</p>
        <p>We do not set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our Users to enhance the experience on our site. Some of our business partners(e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. This site uses click to talk technology (also commonly referred to as push to talk and call me now) to allow Users to receive a phone call from a company representative to provide assistance. This service is provided by a third party, ATG (formerly eStara Communications), who will collect names and phone numbers from users wishing to use the service. This collection of PII is only used by eStara for the purposes of placing the outbound phone call and providing reporting to 3Ci. No collection of PII by eStara is used for marketing purposes either by eStara, or 3Ci. If you choose to not provide your Personally Identifiable Information to obtain assistance, you may contact us directly at 888-888-CARE.</p>
        <p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. </p>
        <p>Our Web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any personal information about our Website visitors, they are just the technique we use to compile our anonymous, aggregated statistics about Website usage.</p>
        
        <h2>HOW WILL I KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY?</h2>
        <p>If this Privacy Policy is changed, we will post those changes on our Website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how it is used, and under what circumstances, if any, it is disclosed. If at any point Personally Identifiable Information will be used in a manner significantly different from that stated in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise disclosed to you, at the time it was collected, we will prominently post any changes on our Website for 30 days prior to any change. We may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that generally will not affect our use of your Personally Identifiable Information. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should refrain from using our Website.</p>
        
        <h2>WHO DO I CONTACT IF I HAVE ANY PRIVACY QUESTIONS?</h2>
