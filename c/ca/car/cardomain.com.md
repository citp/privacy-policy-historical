# CarDomain Network, Inc. – Privacy Policy

**Last Revision: March 9th, 2009**

CarDomain wants to make it easy for you to understand its information collection practices. You are probably sick of the legalese that companies put in their privacy policies. We are too. So we decided to revise our privacy policy to be in plain English.

Our Privacy Policy describes the types of information we collect from you when you use CarDomain’s websites, services, and applications (the “Services”) and how we use such information. By using the Services, you agree to this policy. We may change or update this policy from time to time. Any updated policy shall be effective after it is posted.

There are three categories of information which we may obtain in the course of our relationship with you. These are described below, along with a description of how we may use such information. Note: our use of information is subject to exceptions (e.g., we may disclose Personal Information in response to a subpoena) which are discussed in the Section titled “Does CarDomain Share the Information it Collects With Others?”

  * User Contributed Information.Information you voluntarily post, upload, or display to other Service users through the Services is “User Contributed Information”. For example, the information on your Ride Page is User Contributed Information. **USE OF USER CONTRIBUTED INFORMATION** : Our use of this information is straight-forward — we publish it in accordance with any privacy settings in your account. However, you should assume that this information will be accessible by anyone. By using our Services, you agree that we can use the User Contributed Information in accordance with this policy and in accordance with our terms of service.
  * Personal Information.Information that you provide us when using the Service which (i) is not provided for publication or display through the Services and (ii) identifies you by full name, full postal address, phone number, or email address, or includes information necessary to process payment for the Service, such as a credit card number, expiration date and billing address, is “Personal Information.” For example, you may provide Personal Information such as an email address when you register to use certain Services. **USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION** : We will not reveal your Personal Information to other Service users unless you authorize it. We will not sell your Personal Information or share your Personal Information with others. Again, we may use Personal Information for the purposes for which it was provided, such as to process transactions, identify you as an account-holder, or send you an email.
  * General Information.”General Information” is information that you  
provide us or which we collect which is not Personal Information (e.g., information about your computer or browser, or age and gender information you provide when filling out a survey). For example, we may collect General Information about your computer (Mac or PC), web browser, Internet Protocol (IP) address and the date and time of your visit. We may use cookies, web beacons and GPS software to collect General Information. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We may use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. Normally, these cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. We may use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID to make it easier for you to login when you come back to use the Service. You may be able to remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature. A web beacon is a small graphic files used to determine if a page has been viewed. If you use the Service on a GPS-enabled mobile device, we may collect the city and state and other information provided by GPS. **USE OF GENERAL INFORMATION** : We may use General Information to understand how people use our Services. We may use cookies to keep you logged in to your account, track your use of our Services, or to prevent you from entering the same information repeatedly.



You can use many of our Services without submitting User ContributedInformation. If you submit User Contributed Information, we typically allow you to choose how or when we publish User Contributed Information. We may send you marketing messages to any email address you provide us. You can choose not to receive any marketing email from us by following the instructions to “unsubscribe” provided in the email. You can also log in to your account to unsubscribe from receiving marketing email.

  * Sites we do not own or operate.The Services may contain or link to features and content on websites we do not own or operate. These websites may collect information about you, but we do not have control over their collection practices. If you are visiting a third-party website, please review its privacy policy.
  * Advertisers.We may use third-party advertising companies and networks to serve ads through our Services. These companies and networks may collect and use General Information to deliver more relevant advertising to you, and for other business purposes.
