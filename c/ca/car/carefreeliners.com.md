This includes companies that provide analytics to us about use of our website, so that we can evaluate use of our websites and continue to improve our website content.

Our U.S. websites are intended for residents of the U.S. If you happen to live in another country yet use our U.S. websites, any data collected about you with respect to your use of our websites will be transferred to the U.S. As such, please note that there may be different standards that apply to how your data may be used and protected than the standards in place in your country. Nevertheless, Energizer has put in place safeguards to ensure that your data is safeguarded and protected irrespective of the country. This includes obtaining written assurances from third parties assisting Energizer with its website or given access to your data, which require them to adopt standards that ensure an equivalent level of protection for your data as that adopted by Energizer.

Except as provided below in "Promotions and Third Parties," Energizer does not share or sell any personal information that you provide to us through our website for any separate use by any third party.

## U.S. – E.U. and U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Certifications

Energizer has certified to a privacy program called Safe Harbor Certification that is co-sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission, for purposes of its employee and compliance personal data. The program applies to personal data pertaining to residents of the European Union and Switzerland to the extent that the data is transferred to or accessible by Energizer companies in the United States. U.S. companies that certify to the Safe Harbor program voluntarily agree to adhere to the Safe Harbor privacy and security standards, which, in some respects, are more stringent than current U.S. requirements for privacy and security. The seven Safe Harbor Principles that Energizer has certified to uphold are: Notice, Choice (Consent), Onward Transfer, Data Integrity, Security and Enforcement. You can learn more about the Safe Harbor program and the requirements that Energizer and other companies that have certified must uphold at: http://export.gov/safeharbor/ and can also view Energizer’s Safe Harbor certification form on file with the U.S. Department of Commerce through that website.

If you feel that Energizer is not abiding by its Safe Harbor commitments or have questions about our Safe Harbor practices, please email us at: webmaster@energizer.com, or write to us at: Energizer Headquarters, 533 Maryville University Drive, St. Louis, MO 63141, ATTN: energizer.com, or call us at: (800) 383-7323.

## Safeguarding Your Information

We follow applicable laws and requirements to protect your information. Among other things, Energizer has adopted physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards that are designed to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, alteration, theft, unauthorized access, or unauthorized disclosure. We evaluate these safeguards on an ongoing basis to help minimize risks from new security threats as they become known. However, as is the case with all websites, we unfortunately are not able to guarantee 100% security for data collected through our public websites.

## Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

This website is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. Energizer does not market any of its products online for children under the age of 13, nor does Energizer design its online applications, advertisements and other features to attract an audience of children under the age of 13. Although certain pages within the website may reference "kids," "children," or "students," Energizer strictly intends for such portions of the website to be used only by adults (such as parents and teachers) or children of the age 13 or older. Energizer adheres to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and do not knowingly register or otherwise collect personally identifiable information from any child under the age of 13 without the prior verifiable consent of the child's parent or guardian. However, we are allowed to collect personal information from a child for the one-time purpose of responding to an inquiry, answering an email, or seeking Verifiable Parental Consent at the request of the child under the age of 13.

Energizer does not sell or share information obtained from minors with any third parties for their own use. The third parties who may have access are those assisting us with or co-sponsoring our website fulfillments, such as for purposes of filling orders or processing payments. We do not share a child's information with blogs or other sites where the information would be publically accessible.

If Energizer should inadvertently collect information from a child under the age of 13, we delete that information, except to the extent needed to seek Verifiable Parental Consent from the minor's parent or legal guardian. When Verifiable Parental Consent is obtained, we collect only that personal information from a minor that is relevant to the registration or purchase. We protect the information with security safeguards and confidentiality measures that are commensurate with the sensitivity of the information. Parents or legal guardians have the right to review their child's personal information, delete it, or withdraw permission to allow further collection or use of that information.

## Update, Modify or Correct Your Information

Energizer takes reasonable steps to ensure that your personal data is accurate and up-to-date for the purposes for which it was collected. We encourage you to contact us to update or correct your information if it changes or if you believe that any information that we have collected about you is inaccurate. Consistent with legal requirements and limitations, Energizer also permits you to obtain a copy of personal information that we hold about you. To do so, please email us at webmaster@energizer.com, or write to us at: Energizer headquarters, 533 Maryville University Drive, St. Louis, MO 63141, ATTN: energizer.com.

## Right to Unsubscribe

You have the right to unsubscribe from any services that we offer, if you no longer want to participate. To do so, please use our Contact Us link on this site for additional information, or email us at webmaster@energizer.com.

## [View Privacy Policy in French](https://web.archive.org/en/Documents/Privacy%20Policy%20Final%20FR.pdf)

This Safe Harbor Website Privacy Policy contains the principles that Energizer Holdings, Inc., including its subsidiaries and affiliates in the United States (collectively referred to in this Policy as "Energizer”), apply to personal information transferred to or accessible by those U.S. affiliates, to the extent that the information pertains to or otherwise identifies residents of the European Union (EU) or Switzerland.

## SAFE HARBOR FRAMEWORK

The Safe Harbor Framework is an international data privacy and cross-border personal data transfer program established by the United States Department of Commerce, in consultation with the European Commission and the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland. The program allows companies in the U.S. such as Energizer to self-certify their compliance to the standards under that framework. Companies that do so (including Energizer) are considered by the EU and Switzerland to have adequate privacy and security safeguards in place such that they can receive access to personal information pertaining to residents of those countries without first having to fulfill another data transfer method as provided in their data protection laws. They are also recognized to be among the top U.S. companies for privacy and security compliance.

## SCOPE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Energizer’s Safe Harbor certification encompasses personal information pertaining to residents of the E.U. and Switzerland, which is collected or processed by Energizer’s U.S. affiliates in relation to the company’s human resource and/or compliance activities.

## SAFE HARBOR STANDARDS

Energizer has committed to uphold the Safe Harbor standards for any personal information pertaining to EU or Swiss residents which is accessible by its U.S. affiliates, and which relates to the company’s human resource or compliance activities. The Safe Harbor standards are based on seven principles:

**Notice:** Consistent with legal requirements, Energizer informs EU and Swiss residents about the purpose(s) for which it collects and uses their personal information, the types of third parties who will be given access to the information; the choices and means offered to individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal information, and how to contact Energizer for any questions or complaints.

**Choice (Consent):** Energizer processes personal information pertaining to EU and Swiss residents in accordance with the purposes for which the information was originally obtained or later authorized by the individual, and not for separate purposes unless authorized or required by law. When consent is required from the individual, and in accordance with its legal obligations, Energizer provides those individuals with the opportunity to withdraw consent at any time ("opt-out"), in which case their data is not further processed.

**Onward Transfers:** Energizer will obtain written assurances from any third party entrusted with personal information pertaining to residents of the EU or Switzerland, which confirm that the third party is capable of and will uphold an equivalent level of protection for the data. These assurances may be inferred from organizations that are located in a country that has received an “adequacy” determination from the European Commission or from those that have independently certified to the Safe Harbor program for the type of personal information that they will receive from Energizer (assuming that their certification is and remains in good standing).

**Security:** Energizer takes reasonable steps to protect personal information pertaining to EU and Swiss residents from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

**Data Integrity:** Energizer takes reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information pertaining to EU and Swiss residents is accurate, complete, current and otherwise reliable and relevant in relation to the purpose for which the information was obtained.

**Access and Correction:** In accordance with the Safe Harbor program requirements and taking into account legal limitations that may apply, Energizer permits reasonable access by EU and Swiss residents (after proper authentication) to the personal information collected and held about them by Energizer, with the accompanying right to correct their information for accuracy, if necessary. There are certain limitations to Access and Correction rights, as set forth in the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor materials. That information can be reviewed on the U.S. Department of Commerce's website at www.export.gov.

**Enforcement:** Energizer has established internal mechanisms to verify its ongoing adherence to this Policy and to ensure appropriate enforcement for violations, in a manner consistent with the Safe Harbor program requirements. Individuals who have concerns about this Policy or about the manner in which Energizer is processing their personal information under its Safe Harbor certification are encouraged to contact the Energizer Legal Department at the Energizer Headquarters address below. Energizer will attempt to resolve any concerns through its dispute resolution process, but in the event that it is unable to do so, it has also agreed to participate in the Safe Harbor dispute resolution process established by the EU and Swiss Data Protection Authorities.

**Limitation on Scope of Principles:** Adherence to these Safe Harbor Principles may be limited to the extent required by any legal, governmental, national security or public interest obligation.
