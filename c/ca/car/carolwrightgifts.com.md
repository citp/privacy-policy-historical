_Cookies_

To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we invoke a standard feature found in browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of anonymous user ID that resides on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can't read data off your hard drive. 

We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service. We may share this data with third parties to achieve those goals. In. addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on our sites visited by our users. We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. Of course, you can set your browser not to accept cookies. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of **CarolWrightGifts.com** 's features (e.g. personalization and storage of shopping bag items), and we recommend that you leave then turned on. 

**Children's Information**

**Confidentiality and Security**

We use modern technology to protect the information you submit. All personally identifiable user information is stored on secured servers and behind a firewall.
