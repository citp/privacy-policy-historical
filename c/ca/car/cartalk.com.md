**Gathering of Information**  
CarTalk.com collects personally-identifying information (such as your name and e-mail address, and, for purchases, your address, telephone number, and credit card information) from the

**CarTalk.com Services for a variety of purposes.**

For users of CarTalk.com Mobile Services, the access logs record the identifier provided for your mobile device by your wireless carrier ("carrier identifier"). Otherwise, the access logs do NOT record a visitor's name, address, e-mail address, credit card numbers, or any other personally-identifying information.

  * General location information (based on IP Address)
  * The date of the visit.
  * The time of the visit.

  * A list of files downloaded or viewed.
  * The amount of time spent listening to/viewing media files.
  * Any errors encountered.



**Cookies and Other Technologies**  
CarTalk.com also uses 'cookies' to collect information. A cookie is a string of characters that can be written to a file on the user's hard drive when the user visits a web site, application or service. Only the web site, application or service that set the cookie can read it, and it can only be used as a record keeping device to store user IDs and information that the site already has. It cannot be used to read other information from the user's hard drive.

CarTalk.com uses cookies to track users' activity through the CarTalk.com Services in order to improve the site/application/service architecture, to offer the user interactive features that would not be possible without them, to offer local station content, and to recall specific information to save the user time during subsequent visits to the CarTalk.com Services. For example, cookies allow CarTalk.com to remember your registration information while you are logged in. Shameless Commerce and other interactive features also use cookies. Our sponsorship service vendors, which serve sponsorship messages onto the CarTalk.com Services, and third party vendors that measure and analyze the use of the CarTalk.com Services for CarTalk.com, may also use their own cookies.

CarTalk.com and the third party vendors that measure and analyze use of the CarTalk.com Services for CarTalk.com also may use web beacons, alone or in conjunction with cookies, to help compile information about and facilitate usage of the CarTalk.com Services, including usage of certain API Content. A web beacon is an electronic image, also known as a single-pixel (1x1) or clear .gif, which can be used to recognize certain information on your computer, such as cookies, the time and date of a page viewed, and a description of where API Content is placed. We may use web beacons on this site from time to time for this and other purposes.

If you wish to prevent certain or all cookies or web beacons from being set to your hard drive or device, or to clear existing cookies or web beacons from your browser's or device's cache, you may be able to disable them in your browser's preferences, although your browser might then be unable to accommodate certain functionalities on the CarTalk.com Services.

**Use of Information**  
The use of personally-identifying information is limited to the following: managing and administering the CarTalk.com Services; responding to user messages; listing name and location (city, state and/or country) information provided by users when broadcasting or publishing User Materials; fulfillment of Shameless Commerce orders; contest management; editorial purposes such as contacting users for an online survey; sending CarTalk.com e-mail newsletters and other communications, including marketing and promotional communications, from CarTalk.com or NPR member stations to users who have 'opted in' to the receipt of such communications; other internal CarTalk.com purposes; and other purposes specified at the time the information is gathered. CarTalk.com may contact users regarding their submissions in certain circumstances.

Any information that you disclose when participating in the Car Talk Community (including creating a profile or submitting a comment to a story or blog or in a discussion thread or a recommendation posted to the Mechanics Files section), such as your full name and any nickname, is likely to become public. This information may be posted on the CarTalk.com Services. In addition, CarTalk.com may use, copy, sublicense, modify, transmit, publicly perform, display, create derivative works of, host, index, cache, tag, encode, and/or adapt any User Materials, and any information contained therein, in any and all media formats or channels, whether now known or hereafter devised, including, but not limited to, the CarTalk.com Services, NPR and NPR-member-station web sites and services, other third party web sites and services, over the air (on radio or television), and on mobile platforms.

In addition, if you send User Materials to CarTalk.com through the CarTalk.com Services, we may print the User Materials, or an excerpt from the User Materials, on the CarTalk.com Services, read them on air, or otherwise publish them in any other medium, together with your name and location (city, state and/or country) if you provide that information to us.

Excluding information provided by the user when participating in the Car Talk Community or sending User Materials to CarTalk.com, which may become public as discussed above, personally-identifying information collected by CarTalk.com is not provided to outside parties except, for limited purposes, NPR and NPR-member stations, CarTalk.com service vendors (such as the Shameless Commerce order fulfillment service, CarTalk.com's email list manager, and the provider of the tool that allows users to sign in using information from their account with a third party service), and other third parties when the user specifically consents to such distribution (such as the disclosure of your name to a friend when you email or otherwise share a story to that friend). In these circumstances, the information is provided for the sole purpose of and only to the extent necessary for—delivering the requested goods to the user, delivering communications from CarTalk.com or NPR to users who have 'opted in' to the receipt of these communications, providing services for and on behalf of CarTalk.com, or serving other internal CarTalk.com or NPR purposes.

CarTalk.com also may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or if it believes that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process, (b) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the CarTalk.com Services, or (c) protect the personal safety or property of users of the CarTalk.com Services, the public or CarTalk.com and its employees. If you do not want your personally-identifying information to be collected or used for any of these purposes, please do not provide it (although if you do not provide it, you may not be able to use or participate in certain features of the CarTalk.com Services). You can also 'opt out' according to the process described below.

CarTalk.com, with the assistance from time to time of its third party service vendors, uses non-identifying aggregate information to analyze use of and better design the CarTalk.com Services and to share with third parties in aggregate form only as appropriate. For example, we may tell a third party that a certain number of users accessed a particular audio stream on our Web site. However, we will not disclose any information that could be used to identify those users.

**Security**  
CarTalk.com has in place what we believe to be appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Credit card information provided to the Shameless Commerce section is protected against unauthorized use by 128-bit encryption and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security features, which scramble your personal information so that only your browser and the Shameless Commerce server can decipher it. However, no Internet, e-mail or mobile transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Because most e-mail and mobile transmissions are not encrypted, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail or other mobile transmission.

This will not necessarily remove previous public comments and other User Materials Submitted for public display on the CarTalk.com Services. The user understands that it may be impossible to delete personal information entirely because of backups and records of deletions.
