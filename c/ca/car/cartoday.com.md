**PRIVACY POLICY**  
We ensure adequate protection and management of personally identifiable information. 

We do track and analyse data for trends and statistics, but the individual user remains anonymous. 

We store information you supply in our free e-mail services in fully secured databases with restricted access. This information may be updated through our subscriber functions within the e-mail or on the website.

We will only ever disclose aggregate information about our user base. Aggregate information will never disclose who you are, but rather identifies the user population in general terms (e.g. 61% female etc.). 

So that we can better serve you with more tailored information, we utilise "cookies". You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. "Cookies" are completely harmless, so we'd recommend you accept them. 

The privacy practices of those sites linking out of us, is not our responsibility. We'd recommend you check their policy on privacy before disclosing personal information.
