# Privacy and Cookie Policy | Carat Global

This privacy policy explains how Carat, a trading division within the Dentsu Aegis Network Group (referred to as "we" and "us" in this policy) may collect and use personal information from you when you use our website ( **www.carat.com** ).

As a business, we are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of all individuals with whom we interact. We will process your personal information at all times in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws.

**Personal information we collect on this website**

We collect information about you if you make use of any of the interactive features within our website that rely on a personalised response, or where you ask us to respond to a query you have, or add your details to one of our alert services. The information we collect is limited to the details we need to provide the specific service you have asked for. We do not collect sensitive information, such as your political or religious beliefs, ethnic background, sexual preference, health or any other sensitive information.

**How we use this information**

Except where required by law, we only use the personal information you provide to us to deliver the specific information or service you have requested. For example, if you have requested further information on our regulatory news, or wish to subscribe to our alert service, or submit an enquiry in relation to a job or career opportunities through this site, though we will only use the email address you provide to us to respond to that request. Without your express consent, we will not use your contact details for any other purpose.

**How we store your personal information**

We are committed to ensuring your personal information is kept secure and confidential and not kept for longer than is necessary. From time to time we may ask other members of our group, or third party service providers, to help us manage our information technology systems. Some of these systems may be located in countries overseas. We will only transfer your information to a third party service provider or overseas, where we are satisfied that adequate levels of protection are in place to protect the integrity and security of any information being processed and compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws.

**How we deploy “cookies”**

Cookies are small packets of information stored by your web browser when you visit certain websites, including our website. Cookies are generally used by websites to improve your user experience by enabling that website to ‘remember’ you, either strictly for the duration of your visit (using a “Session” cookie which is erased when you close your browser) or for repeat visits (using a “Permanent” cookie).

We do not use cookies to store any personally identifiable information about you.

You can learn more about cookies from allaboutcookies.org.
