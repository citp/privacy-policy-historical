<p>Please read this Privacy Statement carefully since by accessing our website (the “Site”) and sharing information with us, you agree to be bound by our Privacy Statement and freely consent to the information collection and use practices described in this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>To proceed on our Site, you have been asked to provide clear and express consent to the collection, processing, and sharing of your user information via cookies and similar technologies. <br> <br> To EU Individuals: this Privacy Statement and the stated guidelines are intended to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679 (the “General Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR”) and to provide appropriate protection and care with respect to the treatment of your user information in accordance with the GDPR.</p>
<p>If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use this Site. CAREERS have established the following Privacy Statement so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your information. This policy describes the overall privacy practices of CAREERS regarding information we collect on our network of web sites and through our other Internet advertising mediums, including but not limited to email. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that CAREERS does not own or control, or to people that CAREERS does not employ.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected by CAREERS: Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>CAREERS collects various types of information from you to better meet your needs and to provide you with a more relevant user experience. Some of this information is collected automatically through cookies (a small text file placed on your computer) or other Internet tracking technologies such as a tracking pixel. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. Please note that rejecting cookies by changing your browser settings may result in a lower quality experience for you while you are visiting our Site.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong></p>
<p>The types of information your browser or internet session automatically sends us each time you visit one of our sites, which we automatically collect from our web server logs, includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your browser, e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, UC Browser, Opera, Edge.</li>
<li>Your Internet domain, e.g., AOL, Netcom, Earthlink, etc.</li>
<li>Your computer’s operating system, e.g., Windows, Mac OS X, UNIX, Linux, iOS, Android.</li>
<li>Your navigation path, i.e., the URLs of where you come to our Site from, which of our pages you visit, and where you go as you leave.</li>
<li>Your IP Address</li>
</ul>
<p>This information lets us see how users are finding our Site, and it tells us which pages are visited the most often so we can make our Site more useful. The non-personally identifiable information that CAREERS collects is used for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content in an effort to create a more personally relevant experience. The information is also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different users. We may share with third parties non-personally identifiable aggregate information, such as how many individuals clicked on a specific advertisement on an anonymous or non-identifiable basis.</p>
<p>We participate in a cookie-based exchange. Although the exchange uses some anonymous information about you to display ads, we don’t permit these companies to collect any personal information about you. Our partners use cookies to collect anonymous information, which may be used to tailor the advertising you see on the sites or elsewhere on the web.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here:&nbsp;<a href="http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>We only collect personal information from our visitors on a voluntary basis. Please be cautious in determining which information (especially personally identifiable information) you choose to provide. Personal information may include name, email address, physical address, telephone or facsimile number or demographic information such as age, gender and personal interests. Once this information that you voluntarily provide is collected, it is then forwarded to the applicable entity (for example, an educational institution to which you requested information). In the context of education, upon the school(s)’ receipt of your information, an admissions representative may contact you via telephone, email or direct mail to assist with your request. Additionally, a representative from CAREERS or a third party may use your personally identifiable information that you provided to subsequently contact you by telephone in order to confirm your interest and assist you in the process, as well as to obtain your feedback on the quality of the follow-up you received and/or discuss additional education related opportunities.</p>
<p>The personal information you provide to us may also be used and/or combined with aggregated information and information from third parties for such purposes, including without limitation, to: (i) improve the Site’s features and functionality; (ii) provide a more personalized experience by customizing the content, products, events and services offered by us or third parties; (iii) provide information, communicate with you and respond to your inquiries; (iv) conduct research about your Site use through voluntary surveys; and (v) “pre-populate” forms.&nbsp;If we combine other information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Your information may also be shared with our subsidiaries, affiliates or other third parties who assist us in administering the Site, including processing personal information, and various programs and promotions on our behalf. These individuals and entities can only use the information to administer our Site and programs and are bound to keep and process your information in compliance with this Statement and other confidentiality and security provisions. In addition, there is also the possibility that CAREERS, or part(s) of the company, may in the future be purchased by, or merged with, another company. In the event of such transaction, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to all collected personally identifiable information, which will then be subject to that party’s privacy policy. CAREERS may also disclose such information to a third party if we believe, in our discretion, that we are required to do so pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process, to comply with requests from law enforcement agencies or a government agency, department, or body, whether or not pursuant to any form of legal process, or to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of CAREERS or of its employees. This also includes sharing information with other parties to detect or prevent the occurrence of fraud.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletters</strong><strong>, Email, Promotions and/or Offers</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, we may use your personally identifiable information to provide information to you, such as to send newsletters, email, promotions and/or offers that you request, or to personalize the Site in accordance with your requests. We will provide you with directions in all emails, newsletters and/or offers on how to be removed from our lists. Please see the “Updating Information and Opting Out” section.</p>
