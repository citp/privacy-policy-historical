###  SSL Security and Data Encryption

At Career FAQs we take the security of our customers' personal details very seriously. We use proven technology to ensure the highest level of protection. Any credit card information that you send to us is encoded with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) using 128 bit encryption technology. This is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure e-commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal transaction-related information, including your credit card number, name and address, as it travels from your computer to ours, and from our computer to the bank. Interception by an unauthorised party is impracticable, as long as your browser and local network support the use of encrypted data transmissions.

###  Credit Card Information

Your credit card details are used only to complete any transactions which you have authorised us to make.

###  Currency

All prices quoted on the Career FAQS website are quoted in Australian Dollars (AUD). This is the only currency used on this website.
