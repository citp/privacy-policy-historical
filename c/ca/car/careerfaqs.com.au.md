Career FAQs Pty Ltd (ACN 111 754 799) (“Career FAQs” or “we”), cares about the privacy of its users (“you”) and understands the importance of protecting any personal information we collect about you as well as clearly disclosing to you what we may do with your personal information.

We are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers and observe the Australian Privacy Principles (“ **APP** ”) pursuant to the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (as amended).

## Collecting Information

The type of information that Career FAQs collects about you is dependent on how you use the services offered on our website.

### (a) Personal Information

Career FAQs collects personal information about its users. Once an individual decides to make an enquiry about a course, subscribe to our newsletter or download a career or education-related resource, Career FAQs (upon the individual completing an online form) will collect all or some of the following personal information:

  * Full name
  * Address
  * Email address
  * Telephone number(s)
  * State and country of residence
  * Enrolment readiness status
  * Career(s) and/or course(s) of interest



We will not collect or solicit personal information via this site which would be unlawful, unrelated to the functions or activities of Career FAQs, or in a manner we believe is unreasonably intrusive. How we use your personal information is set out below in the section entitled “Use and Disclosure of Personal Information”.

There is no obligation on you to provide us with any of the personal information that we may request, however if you choose not to provide us with the requested information we may not be able to offer the requested service or it may affect our efficiency in providing our services to you. 

### (b) Sensitive Information

Generally, Career FAQs does not collective sensitive information about an individual. Sensitive information, as defined in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and Australian Privacy Principles includes, but is not limited to, information or an opinion about an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs or sexual orientation.

### (d) Non-personal Information

  * Pages accessed and documents downloaded
  * Previous site visited
  * Type of Internet browser used
  * IP address
  * Operating system used
  * Domain name of your Internet Service Provider
  * Banner advertisements you have viewed or clicked on.



We use this information, which remains in aggregate form, to understand how our users use our website. We may also share this information with our third-party education partners for the purpose of providing you with the best course choices.

Career FAQs will only collect information about an individual from that individual, unless it is reasonable and practicable to do so or for reasons compliant with the APP.

## Use and Disclosure of Personal Information

Personal information is requested or collected by us when it is required to assist in efficiently handling your request.

## Cookies

Career FAQs uses ‘cookies’ in its website systems. A cookie is a small amount of data that is placed in the browser of your computer or on your mobile device, and allows you to be recognised as the same user across the pages of a website. Cookies enable you to use services such as downloading a resume or cover letter. You are able to disable cookies via your computer’s web browser, however this may restrict access to some services within the Career FAQs website.

In addition to using cookies, Career FAQs sometimes uses web beacons. A web beacon is a tiny graphic image of just one pixel that’s delivered to your computer either as part of a web page request or in an HTML email message. Either directly or through service providers, we use these pixels as part of our online advertisements either on our website or on third-party websites to learn whether a user who’s being shown an online advertisement also makes a course enquiry and to analyse a user’s traffic patterns in order to optimise the career and education-related services we bring to you.

## Security and Storage of Your Personal Information

Career FAQs takes the security of users’ personal information very seriously.  
We take measures to ensure that the personal information you have provided to us is kept confidential and secure and is protected from unauthorised access, misuse, disclosure or alteration.

We conduct regular reviews to implement new security and encryption technologies to ensure the highest level of protection.
