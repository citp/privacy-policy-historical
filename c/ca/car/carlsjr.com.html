Privacy Policy
</h2>
<div class="shared-top"></div>
<div class="shared-content">
<p class="bold">Please carefully read this privacy policy applicable to Carl's Jr.<sup>®</sup> website.  By using this site, you agree to the following:</p>
<p>Carl Karcher Enterprises, Inc. (Carl's Jr.) is very sensitive to the privacy concerns of the visitors to its site on the Internet.  As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected from visitors to the site.</p>
<p>Certain non-personal information of visitors is recorded by the standard operation of Internet servers of Carl's Jr.  Information tracked includes the visitor's type of operating system (e.g., Macintosh, Windows) and the type of browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer).  This information is primarily used to provide an enhanced online experience for the visitor.  Other uses of this information include internal review of the number of visitors to the site, but only in an aggregate and non-personally identifiable form.</p>
<p>E-mail addresses and other personally identifiable information of visitors, such as a first and last name, home or other physical address or telephone number, are known only when voluntarily submitted, for example, via registration for sweepstakes or contests, content submissions, suggestions or participation in online interactive activities.  Personally identifiable information may be shared by Carl's Jr. with its affiliates, including CKE Restaurants, Inc. and Carl Karcher Enterprises, Inc., with Carl's Jr. and Hardee's Food Systems, Inc.'s respective affiliates and franchisees, and with vendors that help access and manage the information (all of the foregoing are hereinafter referred to collectively as "authorized recipients"), but in all instances the information will be used only for the purposes enunciated in this policy.  Specifically, this information may be used: (1) to help Carl's Jr. better understand visitors' use of the site; (2) to respond to specific requests from visitors; (3) to provide notices to visitors, such as marketing information, discount coupons and new product offerings; and (4) to protect the security or integrity of the site.  Unless otherwise disclosed during the collection, this information will not be sold, transferred or otherwise disclosed to anyone other than authorized recipients, except where disclosure is required by law.</p>
<p>To the extent that any of the sites accessible through this site has different practices, those different practices will be applicable at those sites.  Carl's Jr. is not responsible for the practices, policies or content applicable to these third party sites.  Inclusion of a link to another site does not imply endorsement by Carl's Jr.</p>

We adhere to the DAA's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">www.aboutads.info</a> to exercise choice with respect to participants of the DAA.
