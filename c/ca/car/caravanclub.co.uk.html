        Privacy policy
    </h1>
    <div id="mainContent">
        <p>The Caravan Club Limited, company number 646027,&nbsp;the
registered office and correspondence address is East Grinstead
House, London Road, East Grinstead, West Sussex, RH19 1UA, United
Kingdom ('The Caravan Club') has developed this privacy policy as
we understand that the privacy and security of your personal
information is an important issue to you.</p>

<p>This privacy policy explains what personal information we will
collect from you and how it will be used.</p>

<p>If you do not agree with this privacy policy and the terms of
use policy please do not use this website.</p>

<p>What personal information do we collect and how do we use
it?</p>

<p>The Data Protection Act 1998 ('the 1998 Act') places
restrictions on the processing of personal data by a data
controller. The terms processing, personal data, sensitive personal
data and data controller are defined in the 1998 Act.</p>

<p>We collect personal information from you when you communicate
with us by any media. We may also collect personal data which
relates to you from third parties.</p>

<p>Depending on your relationship with The Caravan Club ('The
Club'), we shall process your personal data for the following
purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>to administer your membership</li>

<li>to administer your enquiries about The Club and purchases of
Club (and third party) products and services</li>

<li>to transfer to third parties who provide services to The Club
and/or members</li>

<li>to provide information to you about The Club and membership
benefits provided by The Club and third parties</li>

<li>to send electronic marketing communications with your explicit
consent</li>

<li>to carry out research</li>

<li>the general objectives of The Club</li>

<li>statutory and regulatory compliance</li>
</ul>

<p>The Club is only permitted to process your personal data if a
condition set out in the 1998 Act applies allowing such processing.
If no condition applies, we can only undertake processing with your
consent. In many cases we are obliged by law to process your
personal data for a specified number of years (e.g. if you purchase
goods and/or services from us); therefore, if you withdraw any
consent from us to process your personal data, it will only apply
to processing we undertake for direct marketing purposes.</p>

<p>Any personal information you give to us will be treated in the
strictest confidence.</p>

<p>The Club may continue to process your personal data after you
have ceased to be a member of The Club or we have sent you any
information requested by you.<br>
<br>
 We also use software to analyse how you interact with our
website.&nbsp; Any information collected in this manner is
automatically anonymised.</p>

<p>We use "cookies" on this site to enable our system to recognise
your computer and allow us to see how you use our site.&nbsp; Most
browsers allow you to stop receiving cookies via option /
settings.&nbsp; However, you should be aware that if you do disable
cookies, you will not be able to login into member-only areas.</p>

<h2>Sensitive personal information</h2>

<p>Certain personal information is categorised by the 1998 Act as
'sensitive personal data'. In some circumstances, we provide you
with the opportunity to inform us of your sensitive personal data
e.g. whether or not you are registered as disabled. You may also
wish to inform us about your sensitive personal data to ensure that
we can provide you with the most appropriate service. By providing
us with this data you are consenting to our processing it for the
purposes for which it was given e.g. the allocation of an
appropriate pitch at the National Rally.</p>

<p>Please note that if you fail to inform us of any sensitive
personal data which may be relevant to your circumstances, this may
mean that we cannot provide you with the most appropriate
service.</p>

<h2>Sharing your information</h2>

<p>If you do not wish us to share your personal data with any third
party for marketing purposes, please write to Membership Services
at The Club's address below, or
call&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 01342
318813.</p>

<h2>Member surveys</h2>

<p>From time to time we ask our members to complete research
surveys so we can improve the service given to them.&nbsp; Your
response to such surveys is voluntary and confidential and will be
used only for internal planning and development purposes.</p>

<h2>Access to your personal information</h2>

<p>You can find out what personal information we hold on you by
sending a written request to:</p>

<p>The Compliance Officer<br>
 The Caravan Club<br>
 East Grinstead House<br>
 East Grinstead<br>
 West Sussex<br>
 RH19 1UA<br>
 United Kingdom</p>

<p>You will receive a reply as soon as practicable provided that we
do not require proof of your identity.&nbsp; We reserve the right
to charge you an administration fee of £10, payable by a postal
order or a personal cheque made payable to The Caravan Club Limited
and sent by first class post to the above address, in relation to
each request that you make.</p>

<p>If we request payment of the administration fee then we will not
reply until after we have received your postal order or your cheque
has cleared.&nbsp; If any personal information held by The Caravan
Club is inaccurate or you wish to make any changes to personal
information previously submitted to us, please write to our
Compliance Officer at the above address clearly explaining what
amendments you wish to be made.</p>

<h2>Changes to the privacy policy</h2>

<p>From time to time we may add new features to the website and
enhance the level of service that we offer to you.&nbsp; This may
lead to changes in how we collect and/or use your personal
information.&nbsp; Any such changes will be notified to you either
at the point any new personal information is collected or by us
updating this privacy policy.&nbsp; Your subsequent use of this
website or submission of personal information to us will be deemed
to signify your acceptance to the changes.</p>

<h2>Security and confidentiality</h2>

<p>Any personal information you send to us will be treated in the
strictest confidence.</p>

<p>Where you are required to submit sensitive information to us,
e.g. banking details, we use encryption technology to minimise the
risk of unauthorised access to and improper use of your personal
information.&nbsp; However, please be aware that despite the
security measures we have in place no computer system is completely
secure and there is always some degree of risk whenever personal
information is transferred.</p>

<p>We will not disclose your personal information to any Government
agencies or authorities except if required to do so by law.</p>

<h2>Links to other websites</h2>

<p>The Caravan Club website provides links to other websites that
offer products, services and materials we think will be of interest
to you. Some of these websites are operated in conjunction with
other companies/organisations and some are operated solely by
independent companies/organisations. In particular, although The
Caravan Club administers and governs the Regional and Centre
caravanning groups organised by its members it does not own or
control the websites operated by these groups in any way.&nbsp; No
linked websites are covered by this privacy policy, therefore, you
should check what data protection measures they have in place
before submitting any personal information to them.</p>

<h2>Direct marketing</h2>

<p>You have the right under the 1998 Act to request that we do not
process your personal data for the purposes of direct marketing. If
you would prefer that we cease to send you direct marketing
information please write to Membership Services at The Club's
address below or call 01342 318 813.</p>

<p>Please note that if you make such a request, you will continue
to receive communications relating to the administration of your
membership and any services purchased.</p>

<h2>Monitoring of telephone calls and e-mails</h2>

<p>Your telephone calls and e-mails to us may be recorded and
monitored for quality control purposes.</p>

<h2>Contact us</h2>

<p>If you have any queries relating to this privacy policy, please
feel free to contact us by letter at the following address:</p>
