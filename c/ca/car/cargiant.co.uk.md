In order to facilitate a test drive, your driver’s licence number will also be recorded. If a passport or driver’s licence is scanned to auto-populate the CRF your image will be cropped onto the form. Our system will also automatically flag if your driver’s licence details do not meet our test drive requirements by checking the length the licence has been held by you and also your age.

Information recorded will be primarily used to help support your car buying journey. This includes contacting you following your visit to offer assistance in the event that you have been unsuccessful in finding the right car.

Your CRF will also be relied upon in the event that a Health and Safety or Security matter requires it, where necessary CCTV operated on the Cargiant premises will be used in conjunction. This may include contacting you or passing on your details in the event of the emergency services requiring access to them.

Please note that most service related conversions at our service desks and on the phone are recorded for Training and Compliance purposes and are utilised in the event of addressing a complaint and to providing feedback to staff where applicable.

## 11\. More about Cargiant Cookies

### Strictly Necessary Website Cookies

These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services such as:

  * Determining if you are logged in or not;
  * Remembering your search settings;
  * Remembering if you have accepted our terms and conditions; and
  * Remembering your preferences such as layout



You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the website will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.

Cookies don't harm your computer. Like other online companies, we use cookies to provide you with more relevant and useful information. We don't store personally identifiable information such as credit card details, but we do use information gathered from cookies to help improve your experience of the Cargiant website.

### Anonymous Visitor Statistic & Performance Cookies

We use cookies to compile visitor statistics, such as how many people have visited our website, what type of technology they are using (e.g. Windows, Mac or Android) which helps us to identify when our website isn't working, how long our customers spend on our website, what page they look at etc and so forth. This helps us to continuously improve our website. These “analytics” programs also tell us, on an anonymous basis, how people reached our web site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have been here before, helping us to develop our services for our customers.

All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies on your browser we will not know when our customers visited our site, and will not be able to improve its performance.

### Advertising

Cookies are widely used in online advertising. Neither us, advertisers or our advertising partners can gain personally identifiable information from these cookies. They will be used to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites.

They do not store direct personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.

You can learn more about online advertising at [http://www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/). You can opt-out of almost all advertising cookies at <http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices>. It is also worth noting that opting out of advertising cookies will not mean you won't see adverts, just simply that they won't be tailored to you any longer.

### Third Party Cookies

Our website, like most websites, includes functionality provided by third parties. A common example is an embedded YouTube video or pulling through Feefo Reviews. Disabling these cookies will likely break the functions offered by these third parties.

### Site Improvement Cookies

From time to time we test new designs or website features. We do this by showing slightly different versions of our website to different people and anonymously monitoring how our website visitors respond to these different versions. We might also use anonymised heat mapping software to understand popular pages and specific functionality on our website. This helps us to offer you a better user experience.

### Remarketing Cookies

You may notice that sometimes after visiting a website you see increased numbers of adverts from the site you visited. This is because advertisers, including ourselves, pay for these adverts. The technology to do this is made possible by cookies, and as such, we may place a so called “remarketing cookie” during your visit. We use these adverts to offer targeted messages to encourage you to come back to our site. However, we are unable to proactively reach out to you as the whole process is entirely anonymised and you can opt out of these cookies at any time as explained above and below.

### Social Website Cookies

These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the website to enable you to share our content with your friends and other networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other websites and building up a profile of your interests. This may therefore impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit.

If you do not allow these cookies you may not be able to use or see these sharing tools.

The privacy implications on this will vary from social network to social network and will be dependent on the privacy settings you have chosen on these networks.

### When do our cookies expire?

Except for essential cookies, most of the cookies on our websites expire at the end of your current session on our website. However, some of our cookies have an extended lifespan which ranges from 1 day to 26 years. Some of our cookies are persistent and will never expire. If the cookie used is a flash cookie, please note that flash cookies do not expire.

## 12\. Turning Cookies Off

You can usually switch cookies off by adjusting your browser settings to stop it from accepting cookies. Doing so however will likely limit the functionality of our's and a large proportion of the world's websites as cookies are a standard part of most modern websites.

Amending cookies setting in different types of browser:

Cookie settings in Edge - <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/196955>

Cookie settings in Firefox - <https://support.mozilla.org/en-GB/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences>

Cookie settings in Chrome - <https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/61416>

Cookie settings in Safari - <https://support.apple.com/kb/ph21411>
