													<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
						
                        <p>CaringBridge was founded as a free online service to 
                          keep families and friends informed and in touch during 
                          important life events, such as medical treatment, childbirth 
                          or adoption. CaringBridge respects your privacy and 
                          maintains high standards to protect the information 
                          you, your family, and friends share with us and with 
                          each other through this web site. </p>
                        <p>This Privacy Statement describes the information we 
                          collect when you use this web site; for example, to 
                          create or visit a CaringBridge Page. It also describes 
                          how we use the personal information you share with us 
                          and some of the steps we take to protect your privacy.<br>
                        </p>
                                             
                        <h2>Your Consent</h2>
                        <p>Please take a few minutes to review our Privacy Statement.  By using this web site, you are consenting to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Statement.   </p>
                        
                        <h2>This Privacy Statement May Change</h2>						
						
<p>This Privacy Statement describes CaringBridge's current policies and practices with regard to the personal information we collect through the CaringBridge.org web site. </p>
<p>We are continually improving and adding to the functionality and features of this web site and improving and adding to the services we offer.  As a result of these changes (or changes in the law), we may need to update or revise this Privacy Statement.  Accordingly, we reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Statement at any time, without prior notice, by posting the revised version of this Privacy Statement on this web site.  Your use of this web site following any such change constitutes your agreement that personal information collected from or about you through this web site after the revised Privacy Statement is posted will be subject to the terms of the revised Privacy Statement.  For this reason, we encourage you to review this Privacy Statement regularly.  </p>
<p>For your convenience, whenever this Privacy Statement is changed, we will alert you by posting a notice on our home page for 60 days.  If more than 60 days goes by between your visits to this web site, be sure you review this Privacy Statement to see if it has been revised since your last visit. 
</p><p>You may access the current version of this Privacy Statement by clicking on the button marked "Privacy Statement" at the bottom of each page of this web site.
                        </p><p> This Privacy Statement was last revised on  May 6, 2004.</p>
                        <h2>Definitions </h2>
												<p><b>"Personal information"</b> means information about an identified or identifiable individual.  Your personal information may include your name, your address, and your e-mail address. </p>
												<p><b>"Registration information"</b> means the personal information provided to CaringBridge by the author of a CaringBridge Page as part of the process of creating or updating a CaringBridge Page.  For example, when you create a CaringBridge Page we ask for your name, contact information, and the name of your sponsor (if any).  We also ask you to select the type of page you wish to create, an address for your page, security levels, a user name and password, and so on.  Registration information may include both your personal information and information about others.  For example, if a parent creates a CaringBridge Page for his or her child, the parent may provide information about the child.  </p>

												<h2>What Personal Information Is Collected Through This Web Site?</h2>
												<p>Personal information enters our database in two ways:  First, individuals provide us with personal information in connection with their use of our service.  Second, individuals share personal information with other members of a caring community when they create or visit a CaringBridge Page.  Although both types of information are stored on our server, we handle each type differently.</p>
												<h3>Personal Information You Provide to Us.</h3>
												<p>CaringBridge collects the personal	information you provide to us when you use our web site, for example, the personal
												information you provide when you create or update a CaringBridge Page, complete a survey, 
												make a donation, use our referral service, or provide feedback.  The information you provide 
												when you use our web site may be your own personal information or may be information about 
												another person.  For example, you may create a CaringBridge Page to communicate with friends 
												and family about medical treatment your spouse is receiving and, in the process, may provide 
												us with the name of your spouse and name of the hospital providing the treatment.  Similarly, others may provide us with 
												personal information about you.  If you have a friend or family member who has created a CaringBridge 
												Page, that individual may have given us your email address and asked us to send you a one-time email 
												inviting you to visit his or her CaringBridge Page.  Please	read further to learn how we use this type 
												of personal information.</p>
												
                        <h3>Journal Entries, Guestbook Entries, and Photographs.</h3> 
                        <p>CaringBridge Pages contain a great deal of personal 
                          information about the author of the CaringBridge Page, 
                          visitors to the CaringBridge Page, and other individuals. 
                          CaringBridge stores journal entries, guestbook entries, 
                          and photographs on its server as a service to the author 
                          and his or her family and friends. Please read further 
                          to learn how we use this type of personal information.</p> 
													
                        <h2>How Does CaringBridge Use Contact Information?</h2>				
												<p>CaringBridge uses your contact information to communicate with you.  For example, we use your contact information to respond to your questions or, if you are a CaringBridge Page "author," to communicate with you about your account.  From time to time, we may send you service related announcements.  For example, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we may send all users an email.  These communications relate directly to your use of our service.  You may not "opt-out" of receiving these communications, but you may deactivate your account or cease using our service at any time.</p>
                        <p>In addition, from time to time, we may send you news and information about CaringBridge, our sponsors and 
                          partners, or our services. We may also send you information about our fund-raising activities or requesting a donation. 
                          If you do not wish to receive these updates or requests, you may "opt out" at any time by following the directions 
                          printed at the bottom of the email.  </p>
													
                         <h2>How Does CaringBridge Use Registration Information?</h2>
												<p>CaringBridge uses the personal information you provide when you create or update a CaringBridge Page to create your CaringBridge Page and personalize our web site for you and your visitors.  We also use this information you provide to compile statistics about our users and their use of our site.  These statistics do not identify you personally.  These statistics help us understand the needs and preferences of the groups we serve and improve the content and functionality of our web site.  </p>

												<h2>How Does CaringBridge Use Survey Information?</h2>
												<p>From time to time, we may post a survey on our web site or, if we have your contact information, we may send you a questionnaire or survey.  Your participation in any survey is always voluntary.  We compile statistical information from the responses to our surveys. These statistics do not identify you personally.  These statistics help us understand the needs and preferences of the groups we serve and improve the content and functionality of our web site.  </p>

												 <h2>How Does CaringBridge Use Feedback?</h2>
                        <p>We welcome your feedback about this web site. We use 
                          your feedback to improve our web site. For this reason, 
                          we ask that you not send us any comments, feedback, 
                          ideas, questions, designs, artwork, software or any 
                          other information or materials relating to the design, 
                          functionality, or operation of this web site or service 
                          (collectively, "Feedback") that you consider to be confidential 
                          or proprietary or that you do not wish to assign to 
                          us. By submitting Feedback to us, you assign to CaringBridge 
                          free of charge, all worldwide rights, title and interest 
                          in all copyrights and other intellectual property rights 
                          in the information and/or materials you submit. CaringBridge 
                          will be entitled to use any Feedback you submit through 
                          this web site, and any ideas, concepts, know-how or 
                          techniques contained in any such Feedback, to improve 
                          this web site, our service or for any other purpose 
                          whatsoever. However, CaringBridge will not use any Feedback 
                          you submit through this web site in a way that violates 
                          applicable privacy laws.</p>
                         
												 <h2>How Does CaringBridge Use Journal Entries, Guestbook Etries and Photographs?</h2>
												 <p>CaringBridge Pages contain a 
                          great deal of personal information about the author 
                          of the CaringBridge Page, visitors to the CaringBridge 
                          Page, and other individuals. CaringBridge Pages, including 
                          journal entries, guestbook entries, and photographs, 
                          may be viewed by anyone who has access to the CaringBridge 
                          Page. For this reason, we offer password protection 
                          and let the author of the CaringBridge Page control 
                          the level of security that will apply to his or her 
                          CaringBridge Page.</p> 
                        <p>In general, CaringBridge does not use the personal information contained in journal 
												entries, guest book entries, or photographs, except to provide this online service to you,
											  your friends and your family.  We do, however, reserve the right to review the content of any CaringBridge Page, for example,
											 	if we receive a complaint about misuse of our web site.  We reserve the right to delete any journal 
											 	entry, guestbook entry or photograph and to take legal action against anyone who violates our Terms
												of Service.  We reserve the right to disclose the content of any CaringBridge Page in response to a 
											 	subpoena or as required by applicable law.  Finally we reserve the right to disclose journal and 
											 	guest book entries, photographs, and other information posted on this web site with law enforcement 
											 	authorities if, in our sole judgment, the content of any posting violates any applicable law. </p> 

												<h2>Does CaringBridge Share Personal Information With Others?</h2>
												<p>CaringBridge shares personal information collected through this web site with third party vendors who act for or on behalf of CaringBridge.  For example, when you make an online donation to CaringBridge, a third party processes your donation on our behalf.  These third party vendors may need information about you in order to perform their functions.  These companies are not authorized to use your personal information for any other purpose.</p>
												<p>CaringBridge shares statistical information about the use of our site with our donors, sponsors and partners.  This information does not identify any individual personally.</p>
                        <p>CaringBridge sponsors include organizations, such as hospitals and other treatment 
                          facilities, who have paid a fee to provide this service 
                          to a certain number of individuals. If you have been 
                          served by one of our sponsors, you may identify that 
                          organization as your sponsor when you create a CaringBridge 
                          Page. If you identify a sponsor when you create a CaringBridge 
                          Page, we share your name, the date you created the CaringBridge 
                          Page, and information about activity levels on your 
                          CaringBridge Page with that sponsor. Sponsors use this 
                          information to make certain their fee is being applied 
                          correctly. Sponsors increase their fee based on the 
                          number of individuals using the service under their 
                          sponsorship. If you do not wish us to share this information 
                          with a sponsor, simply do not identify a sponsor when 
                          you create your CaringBridge Page. </p>
                        <p> There may be some other, limited circumstances in 
                          which we may share or transfer the information in our 
                          databases or the content of a CaringBridge Page to an 
                          unrelated third party, for example, to comply with a 
                          legal requirement, to enforce our Terms of Service, 
                          in response to a subpoena, to protect the security of 
                          our web site and the integrity of our databases, if 
                          we transfer the ownership or operation of our web site 
                          to another organization, if we merge with another organization, 
                          or in some similar event. Where appropriate, before 
                          disclosing personal information to a third party, CaringBridge 
                          will contractually require the third party to take adequate 
                          precautions to protect that information against unauthorized 
                          use or disclosure. </p>
													
                        <h2>Technical Information Collected Through CaringBridge.org</h2>
												<p>When you access this web site, we use standard web server technology to collect technical information, such as the name of your Internet service provider, its IP address, the name of your operating system (such as Windows® or MacIntosh®), your browser type (such as Netscape® or Internet Explorer®), the length of time you spend on our site during a visit, the pages you visit, and so on.  This information does not identify you personally, and we do not attempt to tie this technical information to any of the personal information you provide.  We use this information to improve our web site and make it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors. </p>

												<h2>Security</h2>
												<p>The author of a CaringBridge Page has a unique password that permits the author to update his or her CaringBridge Page and set the level of security for visitors to that CaringBridge Page.  The author can select one of two levels of security for the visitors: </p>
												<p><b>Level I</b> permits anyone who knows the web address (the "URL") of the CaringBridge Page to access the CaringBridge Page </p>
                        <p><b>Level II </b>is restricted to individuals who know the web address (the "URL") of the CaringBridge Page and the current visitor 
                          username and password. The username and password are selected by the author. </p>
                        <p>The author may change the author password, the security level or the visitor username and password at any time. </p>
                        <p>Because of the private nature of a CaringBridge Page, CaringBridge does not 
                          post a directory of CaringBridge Pages. A visitor obtains 
                          access information directly from the author or from 
                          a friend or family member who has the author's permission 
                          to distribute access information. The author may also 
                          use an email that is generated by CaringBridge that
