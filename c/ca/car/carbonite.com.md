### HOW CARBONITE USES INFORMATION

**Personal Information.** Carbonite collects personal information relevant to Your subscription with Carbonite, including Your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information and certain non-personally identifiable information from Your computer that reflects Your use and configuration of Carbonite, including, without limitation, statistics relating to how often backups are started and completed, performance metrics and configuration settings. This information collected will be sent to Carbonite and may be used by Carbonite without restriction.

Cookies are files sent to Your browser and stored on Your computer. If You do not want Carbonite to send cookies to Your browser, You can set Your browser options to reject cookies or notify You when a website tries to put a cookie into Your browser. Rejecting cookies may affect Your ability to use some features of the Services. 

Carbonite gathers general information about visits to our website, the files You have marked for backup, the configuration of Your computer and Your computer’s interaction with Carbonite.
