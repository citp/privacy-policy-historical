# Privacy Policy - Carbon

Carbon, Inc.Updated May 24, 2018

Welcome and thank you for your interest in Carbon, Inc. (“Carbon”) and the Service, as described in the Carbon Terms of Service at [https://www.carbon3d.com/terms-of-use/](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use/) (the “Terms”). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Terms, and capitalized terms used, but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given to them elsewhere in the Terms.

This Privacy Policy describes how we use and disclose the information we collect from you through our website at [http://carbon3d.com](http://carbon3d.com/) (the “Site”), our products and related services, and the HTML-formatted email messages that we send to you and other hyperlinks that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy also covers the use and disclosure of information we collect from you offline.

**The Information Carbon Collects:** ** **

**Personal Information**

** ** “Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual, such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, job title and company.

  * **Through the Services:** When using the Services, such as when you sign up to receive a newsletter or other information, register for an account, or order or use products or services through or in connection with the Services, including your use of Carbon products that may communicate with the Services, you provide Personal Information to Carbon.
  * **Offline Information:** We collect Personal Information from you offline, e.g. when you place an order over the phone or contact our Services team.
  * **Information from Other Sources:** We also obtain information, including Personal Information, from third parties and sources other than the Services, such as third parties who market, sell, support or otherwise provide products or services relating to the Services, including publicly available databases such as ZoomInfo and LinkedIn.



We need to collect Personal Information in order to provide the requested Services to you. If you do not provide the information requested, we may not be able to provide the Services. If you disclose any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Other Information**

** ** “Other Information” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual:

  * **“Cookies” Information:** When you use the Site or Services, we send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other traffic data. We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to enhance our sales process and pipeline, and to personalize your experience. We also gather statistical information about use of the Services in order to continually improve design and functionality, understand how our services are used, and assist us with resolving questions regarding them. Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are using the Services. We may also use cookies or other technologies in online advertising to track responses to our offers. Carbon also permits third parties to place cookies on the Services.



Carbon may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Services. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. You may also wish to refer to <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html>. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Services, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Services to their fullest potential. You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant to your interests and needs. The Site and Services do not currently support technology to respond to “do-not-track” browser signals, or other mechanisms to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about users’ online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.

  * **Analytics:** We use third-party analytics services like Google Analytics and Pardot, which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of our Services and report on activities and trends. These third-party analytics services may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/>, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.
  * **“Automatically Collected” Information:** When you use the Services, we may automatically record certain information from our products or your web browser by using different types of technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” We use this information to measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and compile statistics about usage of the Services and response rates.



This “automatically collected” information may include Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”) or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after the Services, the pages you view on the Services, support status, usage statistics and other information regarding your use of our products and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Services. We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly, including calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems and administering the Services. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.

**Your Choices and Access:**

You have the ability to opt-out of receiving marketing communications, either through links provided in the messages or by submitting a request to [privacy@carbon3D.com](mailto:privacy@carbon3D.com).

You may request to review, correct, update, suppress, restrict or delete Personal Information that you have previously provided to Carbon, or you may request to receive an electronic copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), by sending an email to [privacy@carbon3D.com](mailto:privacy@carbon3D.com). Carbon will process your request in accordance with any applicable laws and our policies and procedures for dealing with such requests.

In your request, please make clear what Personal Information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your Personal Information suppressed from our database or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your Personal Information. For your protection, Carbon may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.

Please note that Carbon may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion).

**Retention Period:**

** ** We retain Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law.

The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:

  * The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services);
  * Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
  * Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).



**Third-Party Services:**

The Services contain references and links to Web sites and services provided by third parties.

Any Personal Information you provide on third-party sites or services is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party’s policies governing privacy and security. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third-party sites or services to which links are displayed on the Services. We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with Personal Information.

Some features of the Services are provided by third parties. This includes sharing on social networks, online store functions and other features. Information you provide to such third parties (including when using these features on our Site) is not governed by this privacy policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third-party services before using them.

We may use a third-party payment service to process payments made through the Services. If you wish to make a payment through the Services, your Personal Information will be collected by such third party and not by us, and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party’s collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information. For example, our online store functions are provided by Shopify, whose privacy policy is available for review at <https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy>.

**Third-Party Advertising:**

** ** We may use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you when you access and use the Services and other websites or online services.

You may receive advertisements based on information relating to your access to and use of the Services and other websites or online services on any of your devices, as well as on information received from third parties. These companies place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags). They also use these technologies, along with information they collect about your online use, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile phone and a laptop. If you would like more information about this practice, and to learn how to opt out of it in desktop and mobile browsers on the particular device on which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, please visit <http://optout.aboutads.info/#/> and <http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/>.

**Children’s Privacy:**

Carbon does not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from persons under 16 years of age, and no part of the Services is directed to persons under 16. If you are under 16 years of age, then please do not use or access the Services at any time or in any manner. If Carbon learns that Personal Information of children under the age of 16 has been collected on the Services without verifiable parental consent, then Carbon reserves the right to take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 16 has obtained an account on the Services, then you may alert Carbon at [privacy@carbon3D.com](mailto:privacy@carbon3D.com) and request that Carbon delete that child’s Personal Information from its systems.

**Data Security:**

While we seek to employ reasonable limited physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to help improve the integrity and security of your Personal Information, no physical or technical system, process, transmission, or storage mechanism is completely secure or immune from outages, losses, attacks, circumvention, design or implementation flaws, and human error. Therefore, we cannot and do not ensure or warrant that information you transmit to Carbon will not be lost or compromised, either during or after transmission. Do not provide your personal information if you are concerned with its disclosure.

**Sensitive Information:**

We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Services or otherwise to us.

**International Visitors and Cross-Border Transfers:**

Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we operate or in which we engage service providers, and by using our Services you understand that your information will be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.  In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information.

**Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy:**

Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy, which may be revised periodically at Carbon’s sole discretion, as provided in the Terms. If we modify the Privacy Policy, we will make it available through the Services, and indicate the date of the latest revision.
