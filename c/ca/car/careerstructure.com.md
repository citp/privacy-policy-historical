# Privacy policy

[Home](https://web.archive.org/) Privacy policy

At CareerStructure.com we make every effort to comply with our obligations under the 1998 Data Protection Act. Additionally, we understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of your CV and other information stored about you while using the site. 

You can remove any of the information that CareerStructure.com stores about you, at any time, by logging in to your 'My CareerStructure' account and choosing to close the account. 

Personal data which you supply to us may be transferred to third party service providers to be stored or processed on our behalf, including third parties located outside of the European Economic Area in countries where there may be a lower legal level of data protection. However, we will always endeavour to handle your information in accordance with this privacy policy, wherever it is processed.

## Registration details

Contact and other details you supply as part of the registration process are stored by us and used to provide you with the information you have requested. 

## Profile and CV information

When you complete your CareerStructure.com profile, including your CV, it can be made available for searching, viewing over the Internet and downloading by any direct recruiter, employment consultant or other person or organisation who requests CVs matching your profile to be sent to them. CareerStructure.com does not verify the identity or the nature of the business of such organisations. 

You can choose to prevent our customers from accessing your personal details, CV and profile. 

You can also choose to make your personal details and your CV anonymous, while having your profile available to be searched on by recruiters. In this instance, CareerStructure.com identifies you to recruiters with an ID number. You can then choose to reveal yourself when you reply. 

**IMPORTANT:** Your current employer may be a customer of CareerStructure.com, or a client of one of our customers. CareerStructure.com cannot restrict the customers who access profiles on our database and cannot be held responsible for any eventuality. As part of the registration process CareerStructure.com offers you the option of remaining anonymous. 

CareerStructure will also use the aggregate data to identify employment trends across different industries, such as salary averages. This information will not be capable of being linked to any personally identifying information about users. 

Some of our customers may be located in countries outside the European Economic Area. 

When you 'apply online', we store some information about you in your 'My CareerStructure' area, but it is protected by your password and may only be accessed by you. It does not form part of our CareerStructure.com candidate database and cannot be searched or accessed by CareerStructure.com customers. You can delete your 'My CareerStructure' account at any time. Your CV can only be viewed by a CareerStructure.com customer if you have consented to this within the profile section. 

If you choose to create a profile and upload a CV to our database, we rely on you to ensure that your details are kept up to date. You should update your CV at least every six months, particularly if your contact details have changed. You will still be able to log in at any time and update your CV and profile. 

Please note that CareerStructure.com reserves the right to remove from our database, CVs which include any content that we consider to be illegal or offensive. 

## IP address information

Like many websites, we routinely capture your IP address information to determine your location. This helps us work out whether you are visiting the site from within the UK, EU or rest of the world, and means we can show you content that's specific to your location and ask the right questions about your eligibility to work in the UK or EU should you wish to apply for a job on CareerStructure.com. 

An IP address, or 'internet protocol address', is a unique identifying number given to every device connected to the internet. Like a car license plate, an IP address is a special serial number used for identification. 

## Statistical information

We provide aggregate statistical information about site visitors and users to recruiters (such as the number of CVs on the database, or the number of visitors to the site) and for other lawful purposes. We provide this information to customers, advertisers, suppliers and other reputable third parties. This will not include any information that enables them to identify individuals. 

## Security

The site is protected against unauthorised access using the latest security devices and 'firewalls'.
