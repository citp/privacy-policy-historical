**GDPR Data Protection Principles**

In respect of the collection, holding, storage, use, and processing of your Personal Data:

  * We will process the data lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way.

Where your Personal Data is processed by third parties outside the EEA, we will ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to adequately protect it, as required by applicable law, including the execution of standard contractual clauses (referred to above) if the recipients are not located in a country with adequate data protection laws (as determined by the European Commission) or certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield framework.

  * Prevent or restrict processing of data which is no longer required
  * Request transfer of appropriate data to a third party where this is technically feasible



As a resident of the EEA, you are also entitled to direct any complaints in relation to our processing of your Personal Data to your national or local data protection supervisory authority.
