Please be cautious in determining which information (especially personally identifiable information) you choose to provide. Personal information may include name, email address, physical address, telephone or facsimile number or demographic information such as age, gender and personal interests. Once your information is collected, it is then forwarded to the applicable entity (for example, an educational institution to which you requested information). In the context of education, upon the school(s)’ receipt of your information, an admissions representative will contact you via telephone, email or direct mail to assist with your request. Additionally, a representative from CAREERS or a third party may use your personally identifiable information that you provided to subsequently contact you by telephone in order to confirm your interest and assist you in the process, as well as to obtain your feedback on the quality of the follow-up you received and/or discuss additional education related opportunities.

The personal information you provide to us may also be used and/or combined with aggregated information and information from third parties for such purposes, including without limitation, to: (i) improve the Site’s features and functionality; (ii) provide a more personalized experience by customizing the content, products, events and services offered by us or third parties; (iii) provide information, communicate with you and respond to your inquiries; (iv) conduct research about your Site use through voluntary surveys; and (v) “pre-populate” forms.  These offers and/or other communications may come directly from us, from our affiliates or from other third parties by various forms of media including, without limitation, email, telephone mail or text messaging.  You acknowledge and agree that this personal information can be collected, maintained by or transferred to a company, or other entity, within the sole judgment of CAREERS.  If you do not wish to receive such offers, please use the “Updating” section below to adjust your preferences.

This also includes sharing information with other parties to detect or prevent the occurrence of fraud.
