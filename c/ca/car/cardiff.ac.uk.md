### Data collected automatically

The data collected automatically by our website helps us understand which parts of it are most popular, where visitors are coming from and how they are using it. This allows us to make improvements in future.

#### Usage statistics

As you use our website, data about the pages visited is sent to Google Analytics so that we know how many people are using it. This includes the individual pages visited, an anonymised IP address, the device, browser and the website you came from. Google can also collect demographic and interests information from the DoubleClick cookie, if it's present on your device.

#### Advertising effectiveness

On parts of our website, we use code provided by Google, Facebook, Twitter or Snapchat to serve adverts based on someone’s past visit (retargeting) and to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. This code sends data to Google, Facebook or Snapchat about the individual pages visited, actions completed on the page, IP address, device and browser.

This data may be held outside of the EU. Google, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat are certified compliant with the EU-US Privacy Shield. You can request this data or ask for it to be deleted via the [Facebook Your Information](https://www.facebook.com/your_information), [Google’s Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/), [Twitter privacy controls](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/privacy-controls-for-tailored-ads) and [Snapchat Support](https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/privacy-settings2 "Snapchat Support") pages or visit [Your Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices) and switch off behavioural advertising from a large number of companies.

We may also use code provided by Adform to measure the effectiveness of other online adverts. No personal data is sent to Adform.

#### YouTube videos

On pages containing YouTube videos, data about the videos you watch will be sent to Google and stored in accordance with [Google’s privacy policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy). It may be used by Google to personalise advertising for you.

#### Twitter feeds

On pages that have embedded Twitter content, we instruct Twitter not to record any information about you. You can opt-out of all Twitter tracking from the [Twitter Personalisation](https://twitter.com/personalization) settings page.

On some parts of our website we use Catchpoint to record how long pages take to load. This is so that we can learn how to make it faster. No personal data is sent to Catchpoint but it does record the browser used on the pages we are monitoring.

#### Approximate location

Our website detects the country you are in, based on your IP address. This allows us to personalise parts of our website for international visitors.
