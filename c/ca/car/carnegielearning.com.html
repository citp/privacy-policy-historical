<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Last Updated: Feburary 23, 2001</p>
                    
<p>We will notify our members when we make any significant changes to our Privacy Policy that affect the use of any personally identifiable information we collect. We will not make use of any personally identifiable information which Carnegie Learning, Inc. gathered from individual members or visitors prior to any such significant change in our Privacy Policy without first obtaining the member's or visitor's consent for any new uses. In addition, Carnegie Learning, Inc. reserves the right to make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that will not affect Carnegie Learning's use of a user's personally identifiable information at any time without any notice to you other than posting any such changes in a revised Privacy Policy on the Carnegie Learning website. We encourage you to periodically review our Privacy Policy to be sure you are familiar with the most current version. The Policy will include the most recent date in which any revision has been made.</p>
                     
                         <b>Information Collected by Carnegie Learning, Inc.</b>
                           <ol>
                              <li><u>INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU</u>
                              In order to use many of Carnegie Learning's online features, tools and services, we ask you to register to become a member. During this member registration process, we will ask you for personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, school, school district, and password.
							
                              All information provided by you will be kept confidential to Carnegie Learning, Inc and will not be shared with third parties outside of Carnegie Learning's membership communities without your prior consent.
							
                              Additionally, when registering for a member account you are given the opportunity to prevent personally identifiable information from being viewed by other members of Carnegie Learning's online services. You may change this setting at any time and at your sole discretion.
							
							The sole exception to this rule occurs on the online discussion forums where all posted messages must be attributed to a member's email address.

                              </li><li><u>INFORMATION GATHERED BY CARNEGIE LEARNING, INC.</u>

                              <p>When you visit Carnegie Learning's websites and interact with the services and tools that reside there, Carnegie Learning, Inc. may collect information on your actions. This type of information is generally collected from two sources. One is from the server log files and the other is from cookies. Please read more about them in section B(9). </p>

                            </li></ol>
              
                      
                        <p><b>How Information is Collected and Disseminated</b> </p>
                        <ol>
                           <li><u>MEMBERSHIP REGISTRATION</u>

                           <p>Many areas of Carnegie Learning, Inc.'s websites are reserved for Carnegie Learning members who have registered with us; for example, chats, message boards and access to special services such as product documentation and online support. This is necessary so that Carnegie Learning, Inc. can assure the quality of its forums. In some areas registration is free and in others requires that your school participate in one of our annual SchoolCare programs.</p>

<p>The membership registration form currently requires you to choose a member name (your email address) and password and provide Carnegie Learning, Inc. with your first and last names.</p>

<p>The personally identifiable information you provide during membership registration will not be given to third parties without your consent.</p>

                           </li><li><u>ORDER FORMS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH E-COMMERCE PARTNERS</u><p>

</p><p> When you provide personal financial and other personally identifiable information to one of Carnegie Learning's e-commerce partners, this transaction will occur on the e-commerce partner's site, not the Carnegie Learning Network and as such the financial and personally identifiable information you provide is collected by and controlled by the Privacy Policy of that e-commerce partner. It is important therefore that you familiarize yourself with the Privacy Policy of the e-commerce site you transact with.</p>

                           </li><li><u>ELECTRONIC NEWSLETTERS AND REMINDERS</u><p>

                           </p><p>Carnegie Learning, Inc. offers free electronic newsletters on a variety of topics. If you choose to subscribe to any of these newsletters, currently the only information you will be required to provide is a valid email address. In order to receive these newsletters you must opt-in to receiving them. Carnegie Learning, Inc. does not share mailing lists from its electronic newsletters with third parties.</p>

                           </li><li><u>PUBLIC FORUMS/CHAT ROOMS/MESSAGE BOARDS/BULLETIN BOARDS</u><p>

                           </p><p>Throughout the Carnegie Learning, Inc. Network various public forums such as chat rooms, message boards, and various question and answer areas are available to you as a registered Carnegie Learning member.</p>
                           
<p>Please remember that any information you disclose in these public forum areas becomes public information and is immediately accessible to other Carnegie Learning members on the Carnegie Learning, Inc. Network, so it is important for you to exercise discretion and appropriate caution when deciding to reveal personal information in these areas. Carnegie Learning, Inc. may decide to utilize the content of Q&amp;A's, interactions with Carnegie Learning Staff, and/or chat room and message board content throughout the Carnegie Learning, Inc. Network and in promotions in order to enhance Carnegie Learning's editorial, advertising, promotional and similar activities. In those cases we often provide authorship credit by listing the author's member name.</p>


                           </li><li><u>SURVEYS AND POLLS</u><p>


                          </p><p> Periodically Carnegie Learning, Inc. will post surveys asking for opinions on various issues from its members. Occasionally, we may request demographic information (like zip code, age or gender). Most information obtained through surveys and polls is aggregated and used internally. In the event personally identifiable information is requested as part of surveys or polls about any Carnegie Learning member or subscriber, such personally identifiable information is never provided to third parties without your consent. In these instances you may expressly choose to receive information from a sponsor, in which case your information is provided to that sponsor only. Some survey answers may be added to your member portrait (so that we can better provide you with content).</p>

                           </li><li><u>MESSAGE FORWARDING AND "WELCOME A NEW MEMBER" SERVICE</u><p>

                          </p><p> Carnegie Learning offers the ability to forward an electronic resource to another member via email or to send an electronic message to another member. If you use either of these services, we will use the recipient's email address in order to send the resource or message and it we will also include your email address.</p>

                           </li><li><u>LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</u>

                          <p> The Carnegie Learning websites contain links to other websites recommended by Carnegie Learning staff and members. We cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such non-Carnegie Learning websites, and we do not control the practices of any of the websites to which we are linked. However, we generally will advise you when you are leaving a Carnegie Learning website through a link.</p>
