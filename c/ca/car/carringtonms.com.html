                Carrington Mortgage Services, LLC ("CMS") operates the web site at carringtonms.com ("Site"). We respect the privacy of each user of the Site (referred to as "you" or a "user"). This Privacy Statement gives you specific information about how we protect your privacy, how we treat information we collect on the Site that identifies an individual user ("Personal Information"), and how we use aggregated information.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>BY REGISTERING FOR OR USING THE SITE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT, YOU CANNOT USE THE SITE.</strong>
                We reserve the right to modify this Statement at any time by posting a notice on the Site's home page. Your use of the Site after the date of the last modification listed at the beginning of this Privacy Statement indicates to us that you agree to the changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Location of Servers and Transfer of Information to the United States</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Site is hosted by servers in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, your Personal Information will be transferred to the United States. By submitting your Personal Information, you consent to its transfer to the United States and to its storage, processing, and use there in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Scope of this Privacy Statement</strong>
                This Privacy Statement applies to your use of this Site only. We do not own, operate or control the web sites of third parties, including sales associate, outside referral agents or their brokers. Accordingly, this Statement does not apply to such parties' web sites or their respective collection, use, storage and disclosure of your Personal Information.
            </p>

            <h3 class="bold">1. Collection and Use of Your Personal Information</h3>

            <blockquote>

                <p>We collect Personal Information from you only when you voluntarily submit it in order to obtain certain information, including without limitation (A) requests to find out more about our programs; (B) requests to contact us; and (C) requests to forward your information to one of our affiliates.</p>

                <p>We honor all "do not track" requests and settings.  If you use any signal(s) or other mechanism(s) that provides you the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services, we will not attempt to override such signals or mechanisms, nor will we track your use of any such signal or mechanism.  When you use our website, no other parties can collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites.  Your choice is indicated by your settings in your web browser.  A "do not track" indication sent from your web browser will result in any tracking activity (i.e., tracking cookies) within the website to be programmatically disabled.</p>

                <p><strong>Contacting Us</strong></p>

                <p>If you submit a request through this Site to find or list a property or to find a sales associate, you will be asked to provide Personal Information and we refer this information the sales associates to respond to your request. For example, if you ask that we list your property or if you ask to see more listings in a given area, you will be directed to a Franchisee sales associated in that area. </p>

                <p>If you contact us, we collect Personal Information, which is retained or referred to an independent sales associate depending on the nature of your inquiry. If you are looking for a property or a sales associate, it is referred to a sales associate; if your inquiry requires a response from us, it is referred to the appropriate department for research and a response. The information we collect is not used in any other way.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <h3 class="bold">2. Collection of Non-Personal Information</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Even if you do not send us any Personal Information, we may collect information about how you use our site ("Non-Personal Information"). This information cannot be used to identify you personally and is explained in more detail below under "Non-Personal Information".
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Cookies</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A cookie is a small data file, often including an anonymous unique identifier that is sent from a web site's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Use of cookies is common on the Internet. A web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser permits a web site to access only the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. But if you refuse cookies, some parts of the Site may not function properly and may not provide services or information you have requested. For example, without cookies, we will not be able to provide you with searches that you have asked us to save.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Like many sites, we obtain Non-Personal Information such as IP (internet protocol) addresses, browser types, the name of your ISP (internet service provider), information about where a user comes from before arriving at our Site, what pages a user visits, the order of those pages, and the amount of time spent on each. A vendor performs this service for us by sending a cookie to gather this information, compile it, and report to us. We use Non-Personal Information to customize the advertising and content you see, improve our services, conduct research, and provide anonymous aggregated reporting for internal audits and third-parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Advertising Networks</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We send to your web browser some of the advertisements you see when you use our network of web sites. However, we also allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our web pages. Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network web site, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web page from the web site. Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. As always, remember we authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies only for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access, to any Personal Information about you.
                </p>

                    <b>Opting Out of Third-Party Ad Servers &amp; Carrington Subscriptions</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you must visit each ad network's web site individually and opt out (if they offer this capability). To opt out of any Carrington subscription or e-mail list, please write us at:

                <p>
                    From time to time, Carrington or its affiliates may use the information you provide to us to contact you to present you with potential business opportunities, and may utilize a third-party vendor to deliver such communications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>You should know that neither Carrington nor its affiliates will sell your Personal Information.</strong>
