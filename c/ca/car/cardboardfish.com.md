### Safe Harbor

mBlox processes, on behalf of its customers, Personal Data that has been collected by or on behalf of those customers including Personal Data received from the European Union. mBlox complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. mBlox has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view mBlox's certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/. Under the Safe Harbor Frameworks, mBlox primarily acts as a Data Processor and each customer acts as a Data Controller. For the purposes of the Safe Harbor Frameworks and this Privacy Policy: a "Data Processor" is an entity that processes Personal Data on behalf of a Data Controller; a "Data Controller" is an entity that determines the purposes for which Personal Data are processed. To "process" Personal Data means to carry out an operation or set of operations on such Personal Data, such as collecting, recording, storing, disclosing, or organizing it. The "Data Subject" means the person to whom a certain set of Personal Data relate; for example, the person who responds to a survey.

As Data Processor, mBlox will only process Personal Data pursuant to the instructions of our applicable customer: the "customer" is the person or entity with whom we contract with to provide Services. mBlox may use the services of third party Data Processors to process Personal Data in accordance with purposes identified for such Personal Data by the applicable customer. mBlox will not be responsible for determining the authenticity of any purported Data Subject's request to access his or her Personal Data. In the absence of express instructions to do so from the applicable customer (which is the Data Controller for these purposes), mBlox will not provide a purported Data Subject with access to his or her Personal Data unless it is demonstrated to mBlox's satisfaction that the applicable Data Controller has refused such access.

### Use by Children

We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about Site visitors who are under the age of 13. If mBlox learns or is notified that it has collected Personal Data from Site visitors under the age of 13, mBlox will immediately delete such Personal Data.

### Opt-Out

We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your Personal Data used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you register with us but no longer wish to receive our newsletters and/or related communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at moc.xolbm@ycavirp.

### Security

We cannot guarantee that your Personal Data will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. While we take technical and organizational measures to guard against unauthorized or unlawful processing of your Personal Data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your Personal Data, mBlox, cannot fully eliminate the security risks associated with such Personal Data. Due to factors beyond mBlox's control, mBlox cannot ensure that Personal Data will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, despite precautions, third parties may circumvent security measures to intercept or access such data.

### Referral Programs

If made available to you, you may elect to use the one of our referral programs to inform friends and colleagues about the our Site and Services. The information collected is used by us for monitoring purposes and occasionally to reward those users who attract others to us for their support.

### Third Parties

This includes links to other websites on the Site as well as any companies (other than mBlox) from whom you may have ordered services or products that are transmitted over mBlox's network, and any companies from whom you may be purchasing telecommunications services. mBlox recommends that you be aware when you leave the Site, and that you read the terms of use and privacy policies of any site, product or service that collects Personal Data.
