# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is applicable for the CareerAddict.com and its subdomains (hereinafter ‘CareerAddict’).

To ensure transparency and security, our Privacy Policy as set forth below will inform you about the nature, scope and purpose of the personal data processed by us.

**WHAT IS PERSONAL DATA**

**WHY DO WE NEED YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

When you use services provided on CareerAddict websites, you may be asked to provide certain personal information. We will store this personal data and hold it on computers or otherwise. We will use this data in the following ways:

  * To register you with CareerAddict websites and provide services where you have registered to receive them. You can unsubscribe from these services and delete your account with CareerAddict at any time;
  * To provide you with information about new products and services and special offers we think you will find valuable;

  * For crime prevention and detection purposes;
  * If you have consented to it, we may inform you about new products and services and special offers of selected third parties;
  * Beyond these purposes, we process your data only if you have granted express consent for its stated purposes.



**TO WHOM WE DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

We do not sell, or trade your personal data to third parties. When you use CareerAddict and our services, you decide for yourself, how much contact or other personal information you wish to display.

We may give information about you as follows:

  * We may provide our third party service providers and processors with access to your personal information. These services providers may include: credit or debit card processing companies; our customer support centre; marketing organizations, who may market and promote  our services; internet service providers who provide internet connection  and host our facilities; consumer research companies that assist us with understanding consumer interests by conducting surveys. We only share your personal information to the extent required for the performance of required by you services. We implemented safeguards to ensure that our service providers treat personal information in a way that is consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy and that it is never used except to fulfill our services to our users. We may also disclose your personal information as permitted or required by law. For example, we will disclose personal information to those governmental bodies, who have authority to obtain it, in order to comply with a warrant or subpoena issued by a court of a competent jurisdiction, and to comply with record production requirements.
  * Our websites may also include social media features (e.g., share or like buttons). Such features are provided by third-party social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook. Where data is collected this way, its processing is governed by the privacy policy of the respective social media platforms.

  * In the event of sale of all or substantial part of the assets of DeltaQuest Media, we may transfer personal information in our control to a third party purchaser that agrees to use personal information for the same reasons as  identified in this Privacy Policy.
  * To our employees and agents to do any of the above on our behalf, now or in the future.

**COMPLAINTS RESOLUTION**

We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. As a user of the CareerAddict websites, you understand and agree that you assume all responsibility and risk for your use of the CareerAddict websites, the Internet generally, and the documents you post or access and for your conduct on and off the CareerAddict websites.

Should your personal data be incorrect, you may have it rectified. You may also revoke your consent to use your personal data in the future, in whole or in parts, or request deletion of your personal data. We believe that any complaint that we may receive is a valuable opportunity to improve the services that we deliver to you and to maintain your confidence in our services.
