						  Click the security logo at the bottom of this page.</p>
							<h2>Here are the types of information we gather.
							</h2>
							<p>Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our 
								Web site or give us in any other way. When you request a quote or purchase a 
								policy on this site we ask for your personally identifiable information such as 
								your name, phone number, address, e-mail address and social security number.
							</p>
							<p>Transaction Information: This is information directly relating to the services 
								you acquire using our services. It includes services provided to you and 
								associated costs, payment history, insurance claims history, and information 
								necessary for ongoing service, billing and payment.
							</p>
							<p>Consumer Report Information: In order to provide you with a quote our service 
								providers may order consumer reports relating to your credit, driving record 
								and loss history. If you request they will provide you with the name and 
								address of the consumer reporting agency from whom the reports were ordered. By 
								obtaining quotes or applying for services on our site, you are consenting to 
								the ordering of such reports.
							</p>
							<p>Automatic Information: We receive this information from your computer when you 
								visit our Web site, including the Web site you visited before ours, your 
								browser, screen resolution, and operating system. We also store "cookies" on 
								your computer to save information entered during the quoting and comparative 
								rate process, and collect technical data, such as your Internet protocol (IP) 
								address, operating system, and session ID.
							</p>
							<p>Information from Other Sources: We will receive information from those referring 
								you to us. We will keep and update information necessary to provide comparative 
								quotes and to service policies. We might receive information about you from 
								other sources and add it to our account information.
							</p>
							<h2>Here is how we use the information you provide.</h2>
							<p>&nbsp;We use your personal information to create your quote. We transmit this 
								information to participating service providers to quote and ultimately provide 
								you with the services you select.
							</p>
							<p>We may share aggregated statistical information from our database with our 
								participating service providers or business partners (for example, the 
								percentage of customers who purchased services relative to those who got a 
								quote). When doing this type of reporting we will not disclose your personally 
								identifiable information.
							</p>
							<p>All information you give us on this Web site is stored on our computer servers. 
								You may, for example, retrieve this information to get an updated quote.
							</p>
							<p>Our business changes constantly. This Privacy policy will change also, and use 
								of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at 
								the time of use. We invite customers to visit the website occasionally to check 
								for program changes and the latest Privacy Statement. Please note that this 
								Privacy Policy only governs the data held by CarInsurance.com and does not 
								apply to the participating service provider once you purchase their services. 
								We encourage you to read their policies.
							</p>
							<p>We use your e-mail address to confirm your purchases and to provide you 
								reminders about our products and services. You can opt out of receiving future 
								e-mail reminders from CarInsurance.com by indicating that desire <a href="http://www.carinsurance.com/optout.aspx">
									here</a>.
							</p>
							<p>You can always choose not to provide personal information, even though it might 
								be needed to obtain a quote or obtain service.
							</p>
							<p>At any point while completing the quote questionnaire you can navigate to 
								previous pages and make any necessary changes. When you save your quote 
								information you can return at any time to change the information. Simply log in 
								on the site, select Review or Purchase. To change the information displayed, 
								type the new data in the form and click the Continue button found on the page.
							</p>
							<p>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, you may indicate 
								this. Such an indication would include notices we might send out regarding 
								changes in policies, such as changes to this Privacy Policy. The change will 
								still govern, and it is your responsibility to review these policies for 
								changes. You can choose not to receive this information by:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Using our <a href="http://www.carinsurance.com/optout.aspx">online opt out form</a>.								</li>
								<li>
								Sending an e-mail to CustomerService@CarInsurance.com; or								</li>
								<li>
								Calling 1-800-964-4859&nbsp;								</li>
								<li>
									The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent 
									your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you 
									when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, 
									you will not be able to easily retrieve your quote if you do not allow cookies.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Here is how we safeguard your information.</h2>
							<p>Our systems are configured to provide privacy, integrity, and authentication in 
								Internet communications. The security measures we have taken help ensure that 
								your data is secure and encrypted, so that a third party cannot capture, read 
								or access the information while it is in transit between your computer and our 
								system. Some of the key features are outlined below.
							</p>
							<p>We use a secure server implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to 
								interact with you when you provide personal information during the purchase and 
								payment processes;<br>
								Your information is encrypted using 128 bit encryption. AOL, Netscape Navigator 
								4.06 or higher and Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher are capable of 
								128-bit browsers. You can tell when you are visiting a secure area in our site 
								by looking at the symbol on the bottom of your browser screen. If you are using 
								Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will see either a lock or a key. 
								When the symbol appears unbroken or the padlock is in the locked position, your 
								session connection is taking place via a secure server.
						  </p>
							<p>Our data security architecture provides for extraordinarily limited access to 
								your credit card or checking account information, though we do transmit the 
								entire number to the appropriate service provider when you purchase a service; 
								and
							</p>
							<p>We limit internal access to our servers and require that our people adhere to 
								high standards of ethics and integrity in performing their jobs and conducting 
								business. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be 
								guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your 
								personal information, CarInsurance.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of 
								any information you transmit to us or any information provided by our on-line 
								products or services, and you do so at your own risk. CarInsurance.com will not 
								be liable for disclosures of your personal information due to errors in 
								transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. However, once we receive 
								your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our 
								systems.
							</p>
							<p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password 
								and to your computer. Be sure to close all browser applications when finished 
								using a shared computer.
							</p>
							<h2>With whom we share this information.</h2>
							<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are 
								not in the business of selling it to others. We disclose information about you 
								to the following people:
							</p>
							<p>The service providers who may be providing comparative rates to you. They may in 
								turn disclose this information to others to complete a quote, complete a 
								transaction, and service you after that transaction. The information sought may 
								include credit reports, motor vehicle reports, previous claims activity and 
								other relevant information. The parties providing this information include 
								affiliated insurance underwriting companies, claims representatives, 
								independent contractors, insurance support organizations, insurance agents and 
								brokers, and courts and government agencies.
							</p>
							<p>We may also disclose quote information and transaction information about you and 
								our former customers to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf 
								or to third parties with whom we have joint marketing agreements, and to 
								companies that have referred you to us or that have a relationship with you.
							</p>
							<p>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other companies or 
								assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the 
								transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that CarInsurance.com, 
								Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information 
								will of course be one of the transferred assets. We employ other companies and 
								individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling 
								orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing 
								repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing 
								assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. 
								These companies have access to personal information needed to perform their 
								functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
							</p>
							<p>Aggregate Information: CarInsurance.com shares the information you provided in 
								aggregate form, to serve ads and to provide on-line and off-line promotions. 
								When we say that we will share such information in "aggregate" form, we mean 
								that we will not disclose individual names, addresses, telephone numbers, email 
								addresses, or other personally identifiable information unless we have your 
								permission.
							</p>
							<p>We release account and other personal information when we believe release is 
								appropriate to comply with law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety 
								of our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other 
								companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We 
								may also share information with other third parties to administer our business 
								or provide additional related services, and as otherwise permitted or required 
								by law.
							</p>
							<h2>Our site has links to other web sites.</h2>
							<p>During your visit to our site, you may come across links that will take you to 
								third-party Web sites. CarInsurance.com does not control the content of or the 
								information collected from these third-party Web sites. These third-party Web 
								sites are not subject to CarInsurance.com's Privacy Policy. Links to 
								third-party sites do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by 
								CarInsurance.com of the content, policies, or practices of such sites. 
								Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these sites 
								before you disclose your personal information to these other parties.
							</p>
							<h2>Protecting Children</h2>
							<p>CarInsurance.com does not sell products for purchase by children nor is this 
								site intended for use by children. CarInsurance.com abides by the Children's 
								On-Line Privacy Protection Act.
							</p>
							<h2>Use, notices and revisions</h2>
							<p>If you choose to visit CarInsurance.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy 
								is subject to this Policy and our <a href="http://www.carinsurance.com/TermsOfUse.aspx">Terms 
									of Use</a>, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and 
								application of the law of the state of Florida. If you have any concern about 
								privacy at CarInsurance.com, please send us a thorough description to 
								CustomerService@CarInsurance.com and we will try to resolve it. We may e-mail 
								periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us 
								not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes.</p>
