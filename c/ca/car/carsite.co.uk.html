<h4 class="mt10">7.3 Why we use cookies</h4>
<div class="ml10">
<ul>
<li>Cookies enable us to identify your device, or you when you have logged in. </li>
<li>We use cookies that are strictly necessary to enable you to move around the site or to provide certain basic features. </li>
<li>We use cookies to enhance the functionality of the website by storing your preferences, for example. </li>
<li>We also use cookies to help us to improve the performance of our website to provide you with a better user experience. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>CarSite.co.uk may use online behavioural advertising cookies to enable us to tailor this advertising and make it more relevant to you.</p>
<p>We don't sell the information collected by cookies, nor do we disclose the information to third parties, except where required by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies).</p>
<p>If you wish to control what cookies are set on your device through the CarSite.co.uk website then you can find out how to do this below.</p>
<div>
<h4 class="mt10">7.4 Why we collect your data?</h4>
<p>By collecting your data, it allows us to understand what your needs and wants are, provide personalised content and match the most relevant adverts and services for you. It also allows us to provide targeted offers and services you may be interested to hear about.</p>
<h4 class="mt10">7.4.1. Essential Cookies</h4>
<p>These cookies are essential for the running of our websites. Without the use of these cookies parts of our websites would not function. For example our mobile site uses cookies to help us identify which of our readers is viewing the site on a mobile device.</p>
<h4 class="mt10">7.4.2. Analytical Performance Cookies</h4>
<p>We use these types of cookies to monitor our websites performance and how their users may use it. These cookies provide us with information that helps us provide better products to their users and also to identify any areas that may need maintenance.</p>
<h4 class="mt10">7.4.3. Functional Cookies</h4>
<p>Functional cookies are used to remember your preferences on our websites. This can be anything from remembering your city in a weather forecast or saving your username.</p>
<h4 class="mt10">7.4.4. Behavioural Advertising Cookies/Third Party Cookies</h4>
<p>We, and our advertisers/sponsors, may use cookies to provide tailored advertising to you which we believe are relevant to you.</p>
<p>Online behavioural advertising is a way of providing advertisements on the websites you visit and making them more relevant to your interests. This is done by grouping together shared interests based upon previous web browsing activity. Advertising is then displayed to you when you visit a website which matches these interests.</p>
<p>Behavioural advertising is based upon your web browsing activity over a period of time - so it's different to advertising you may see when you're looking for something online using a search engine (eg Google) or on the website you may be visiting at a particular time.</p>
<p>As an example, you may be doing research in order to buy a car and read a number of different articles on a number of different websites. If a car manufacturer was part of an advertising network, they may think that you are interested in buying a car and serve you with one of their adverts for one of their cars. It is possible that from reading these articles elsewhere, you would see this advert on one of our or someone else's websites.</p>
<p>We cannot control nor do we have access to any cookies placed on your computer by third party advertisers and sponsors.</p>
<p>We may also track IP addresses. An IP Address is a number that can identify an Internet Service Provider and country location. It cannot provide personal information</p>
<h4 class="mt10">7.5 How to control the use of cookies</h4>
<p>You are not obliged to accept cookies and may modify your browser so that it will not accept cookies. The browser you use to surf the web not only allows you to see the cookies that you have got but also allows you to control their use.</p>
<p>You can control them by allowing them, deleting them individually or deleting all of them. You can also set your browser to not accept cookies altogether. If this option is selected, you should be aware that many websites will not function properly or at all. It may be possible to set your browser to not accept cookies and ask for your consent before each cookie is set on your device. This gives you control over what is set on your device, however has the drawback of slowing down your browsing experience.</p>
<p>There are different levels of control too. You are able to prevent just third party cookies being deployed, effectively opting out of behavioural advertising, and some even allow you to block specific companies you do not wish to deploy a cookie, instead of selecting all companies.</p>
<p>In order to manage your cookies, please select your browser from the list below and follow the instructions:</p>
