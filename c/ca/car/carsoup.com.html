					<img src="/images/help_privacy.gif" width="186" height="34" border="0" alt="Privacy Policy"><br>
					<p>
						<b>Last updated on 03/08/12</b></p>
					<div class="privinfo">
						CarSoup of Minnesota, Inc. ("CarSoup"), has adopted this Privacy Policy for its
						www.carsoup.com website (the "Site"). The Policy describes situations in which information
						about users of the Site is collected, the purposes and use of that information,
						and choices you can make about information that pertains to you. In this Policy,
						CarSoup and its franchisees are referred to as "we" or "our." Users of the Site
						are referred to as "you."
					</div>
					<div class="privheader">
						What We Do</div>
					<div class="privinfo">
						We are an online publisher of information about vehicles and vehicle-related products
						and services. Much of the information we publish is aggregated from people and businesses
						who offer vehicles for sale. Other information is obtained from third parties. We
						try to make it easy to use the Site and to deliver relevant information to you and
						other users. In order to accomplish these goals, we need to collect information
						from or about users of the Site.
					</div>
					<div class="privheader">
						Franchise and Marketing Relationships</div>
					<div class="privinfo">
						In some geographical areas we have created franchise relationships in which we license
						use of the Site and of the CarSoup® trademark to enable a franchisee to be the entity
						who compiles and publishes information about vehicles in that geographical market.
						In those cases, the franchisee also has access to information collected from or
						about visitors to pages of the Site that relate to its franchise. Our agreement
						with franchisees is that they will adhere to the terms of the privacy policies.
						</div><div class="privinfo">
						We may also establish relationships in which the Site is integrated into a third
						party website, whether belonging to a franchisee or not (e.g. forming an arrangement
						by which the Site can be accessed from a tab or button on another site). The CarSoup
						Privacy Policy is specific to information that is collected about users of the Site.
						We generally do not know, and cannot be responsible for how information about you
						is handled once you leave our Site.
					</div>
					<div class="privheader">
						Types of Information Collected</div>
					<div class="privinfo">
						There are three general types of information that may be collected as a consequence
						of your use of the Site. The most common is what we describe as "anonymous information."
						It is anonymous in the sense that it ties to an IP address, i.e. the machine used
						to generate the visit to the Site, but provides no information that is specific
						to the user of that machine. The second is personally identifiable information ("PII").
						PII includes your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, or other information
						that is specific to you. Any PII we collect or use about you would have originally
						been provided by you. Finally, we may obtain credit card information if you purchase
						products or services from us. We handle different types of user information in different
						ways. The type of information being collected impacts on whether or how much third
						party access is permitted.
					</div>
					<div class="privheader">
						Anonymous Information We Collect to Provide Better User Experience</div>
					<div class="privinfo">
						In order to make user visits to our Site more productive and enjoyable, we use "cookies"
						to track those visits. A cookie collects anonymous information. It allows us to
						know if users of a particular computer have been on the Site before and, if so,
						enables us to immediately provide users of that computer with information that ties
						to a geographical location or previous interest. Cookies are downloaded onto your
						computer from our servers. They cannot be opened or run by us on your computer and
						they cannot infect your computer with viruses. You can disable cookies or otherwise
						manage them through tools provided with your browser software and with commercially
						available software packages. If you turn off cookies, though, many CarSoup features
						will not work as well or at all. Furthermore, if you simply delete cookies, you
						should be aware that another cookie will be downloaded on your next visit to the
						Site. It is a process that happens automatically. 
						</div><div class="privinfo">
						We also collect anonymous Site
						visit information in order to measure online marketing activity, to determine how
						the Site is working, to evaluate the content on the Site about which users are interested,
						and to otherwise try to make the Site meet user needs. Generally information captured
						for these purposes is reviewed and utilized in an aggregated fashion. That is, we
						focus more on number or frequency of uses than on any particular visit.
					</div>
					<div class="privheader">
						Anonymous Information Collected by Third Parties to Try to Tailor Advertising to
						Your Interests</div>
					<div class="privinfo">
						We allow third party companies ("Ad Networks") to serve ads on our Site and, in
						some instances, to collect certain anonymous information about users of the Site.
						These Ad Networks may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g. click stream
						information, browser type, time and date of visit, subject of advertisements clicked
						or scrolled over) during your visit to the Site in order to provide advertisements
						about goods and services that are likely to be of greater interest to you than what
						would otherwise appear. Ad Networks typically use a cookie or a web beacon to collect
						anonymous information about activities on the Site. Review of those activities help
						Ad Networks develop a "profile" of users of your computer that, in turn, results
						in advertising being targeted to perceived interests of the users of your computer.
						A description of the user experience benefits of filtering out irrelevant messages
						appears on <a id="SEOHyperlink6" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.
						</div><div class="privinfo">
						Ad Networks also collect anonymous information
						about the number of visitors who view or are exposed to an advertisement served
						by them on the Site. That information is primarily used for purposes of being able
						to report to the advertiser or to us. We also collect anonymous information about
						visitors who are exposed to advertising on our Site. 
						</div><div class="privinfo">
						Another way that Advertising
						Networks may use anonymous "profile" information about users of your computer is
						to provide to you targeted information and advertising when you visit another website
						that is a part of their network. Targeted ads may be served to you on our Site based
						on a profile built from your visits to other websites participating in a network.
						Similarly, your activities on our Site may create or contribute to a profile that
						affects what ads are served to you on other websites in that network. 
						</div><div class="privinfo">
						We will not
						allow third party advertising networks to collect information about visitors to
						our Site if we become aware that the networks are selling, renting, or sharing any
						of the anonymous data with other third parties. Third party Advertising Networks
						provide “opt out” mechanisms that are described in the "Privacy Choices" section
						of our Privacy Policy.
					</div>
					<div class="privheader">
						Links to Third Party Sites</div>
					<div class="privinfo">
						Advertisements and promotional offers from third party advertisers, sponsors, affiliates
						and service providers appear on the Site. Some of those advertisements and promotions
						may be served on the Site by third party Ad Networks. Others are the result of advertisements
						or sponsorships sold by us or our franchisees. If you click on a link contained
						on one of those advertisements, you are accessing a website that is not owned, operated,
						or controlled by us. The operator of that site may have its own privacy policy,
						which you should carefully review and which will govern the collection and use of
						information on that site. We are not responsible for any PII or other information
						collected or provided on the site of an advertiser, sponsor, affiliate, or other
						entity to whose website you can link from our Site.
					</div>

						Information About Children</div>
					<div class="privinfo">
						CarSoup’s Site products and services are neither developed for, nor directed at
						children. We do not employ or offer targeting toward children under the age of 18.
						If you believe that your child has provided us with personal information and would
						like to have that information deleted, you can contact us in the manner described
						in the “Contacts” section of this Privacy Policy.
					</div>
					<div class="privheader">
						Social Media Accounts</div>
					<div class="privinfo">
						We may collect information about you through social media accounts affiliated with
						CarSoup. Unless you specifically choose to allow that information to be used in
						other ways (like e-mail newsletters or contests), we will only uses the information
						accessible as a consequence of contact by you through your social media account
						to contact you through the same social media channel where the original connection
						was made.
					</div>
					<div class="privheader">
						Personally Identifiable Information We Collect</div>
					<div class="privinfo">
						When you register with us in order to use Site features such as MyGarage and Car
						Detective, it is with the purpose of enabling us to communicate directly with you
						to further the purposes of the services for which you are registering. We also collect
						PII when you purchase products and services from us, including advertising of a
						vehicle, or purchase products or services from third parties through us (e.g. vehicle
						history reports). In those cases, our primary purpose for collecting the information
						is to enable prompt and accurate processing of your order. If a third party product
						is involved, we will provide your PII to the seller of that product for the same
						purpose. The seller’s use of information about you is solely governed by the seller’s
						privacy policy. Finally, personally identifiable information could be collected
						in connection with your participation in contests or other promotions organized
						by us. In that case, the information would be used in connection with administration
						of the contest or promotion. Other purposes for which PII obtained by us may be
						used (a) include you in email, website or direct mail announcements that contain
						information perceivable to be of relevance to you, and (b) to conduct audits, research
						or other analysis about either operation of the Site or products or services offered
						on the Site. You can opt out of those uses. Furthermore, we will not use your PII
						to contact you by telephone or text message unless you expressly consent (opt in)
						to that contact. Except for the relatively remote possibility described below, we
						will not sell, rent, or share any of your personally identifiable information to
						or with third parties unless you have expressly consented to that use. However,
						if CarSoup were to be sold, the PII we have compiled would likely be sold as part
						of that transaction unless you have opted out of that use. That PII would, though,
						be subject to the same limitations on use by the buyer that are described in this
						Privacy Policy.
					</div>
					<div class="privheader">
						Credit Card Transactions</div>
					<div class="privinfo">
						When you purchase services from CarSoup through use of a credit card, we collect
						information that is of a more sensitive nature. That credit card information is
						used only to process orders placed with us. We utilize secure server software (SSL)
						to encrypt all account and personal information you input in connection with processing
						of an order. We also segregate customer credit card data to protect it from unauthorized
						access.
					</div>
					<div class="privheader">
						Personally Identifiable Information You Provide To Others Through Use of the Site</div>
					<div class="privinfo">
						As a consequence of use of the Site, you may provide personally identifiable information
						to third parties, including dealers and private parties who have listed vehicles
						for sale on the Site. An example of this information sharing is filling out a form
						to obtain a price quote on a vehicle. We do not control, and are not responsible
						for the content or privacy practices of the recipient of information you provide
						to a third party via the Site. That is also true of communications with buyers or
						sellers of vehicles or other products and services that occur after you have left
						the Site. For that reason, we encourage you to be careful about information provided
						to parties with whom you are not familiar. We have provided information on the Site
						about that topic.
					</div>
					<div class="privheader">
						Data Security</div>
					<div class="privinfo">
						We develop, implement and periodically review procedures that are intended to protect
						personally identifiable information and any sensitive financial information stored
						by us.

						Privacy Choices</div>
					<div class="privinfo">
						If you wish to know whether we have collected personally identifiable information
						about you, you can direct your inquiry to <a id="SEOHyperlink5" href="mailto:privacy@carsoup.com">privacy@carsoup.com</a>. We will use good
						faith efforts to respond within a reasonable time to your inquiry. Similarly, we
						will use good faith efforts to respond within a reasonable time to any requests
						to you may make to update or change any PII which has been collected by us about
						you. As noted previously, we will not use your PII to contact you via telephone
						or text message without your prior express consent (opt in). If you do not want
						us to use your personally identifiable information to include you in e-mail, direct
						mail, or website announcements, you can opt out of that use of your personally identifiable
						information. That opting out can be accomplished by clicking “unsubscribe” on an
						e-mail if that choice is provided or by contacting us at <a id="SEOHyperlink2" href="mailto:privacy@carsoup.com">privacy@carsoup.com</a>. We
						will not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties for
						marketing purposes without your express consent (opt in). If you do not want anonymous
						profile information to be used by third party Ad Networks, whether on the Site or
						on other sites, you can opt out of that use. We try to work only with third party
						advertising networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative. Consequently,
						you can generally opt out of online advertising tailored to user interest profile
						by going to 
						<a id="SEOHyperlink4" href="http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>
						. Note, though, that if you
						thereafter delete cookies, change browsers, or use a different computer, you will
						need to again opt out if you wish to continue to avoid targeted advertising. If
						the opt out mechanism available on networkadvertising.org does not work, please
						feel free to contact us at <a id="SEOHyperlink3" href="mailto:privacy@carsoup.com">privacy@carsoup.com</a>. Finally, if there are legally-required
						opt in or opt out choices that apply to us and are different from what is in this
						Policy, we intend to comply with those legal requirements. Please let us know if
						you believe that information about you needs to be handled differently from what
						happens under our current practice.

						Contacts</div>

						Changes to Policy</div>
