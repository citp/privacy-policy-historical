  1. **Collection of Information.**



1.1 Survey Information. Generation-Z collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a Generation-Z survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a Survey). (As used herein, online means using the Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and offline means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Generation-Z or a third party (a Third Party) may ask an individual to provide various information to Generation-Z, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, Survey Information). Generation-Z may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and use that information in combination with information provided from this Website. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Generation-Z or a Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Generation-Z or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Generation-Z.

1.2 Third Party List Information. Generation-Z collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and Generation-Z subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the Seller). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual’s name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, Third Party List Information). When acquiring Third Party List Information, Generation-Z seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to Generation-Z and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller’s list.

1.3 Other Information. Other occasions when Generation-Z obtains information from individuals include: (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Generation-Z or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Generation-Z customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Generation-Z service or newsletter (together, Other Information).

1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology. Generation-Z currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Generation-Z may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future.

_(a)_ Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual’s computer that allows Generation-Z to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in the Generation-Z database. Individuals who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Website.  
_(b)_ Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using a programming function but can also be used to transfer an individual’s unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Generation-Z to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Generation-Z might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party’s website where baseball products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in Generation-Z database, visits the baseball website, Generation-Z receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the baseball site, and Generation-Z would then update Joe’s profile with the information that Joe is interested in baseball. Generation-Z may thereafter present offers of baseball related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Generation-Z also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Generation-Z database.  
_(c)_ New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Generation-Z’s use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Generation-Z strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.

1.5 Outside Information. Generation-Z may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources of information outside of Generation-Z including information located in public databases (Outside Information).

1.6 Individual Information. As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information Generation-Z gathers or receives about individuals such as usage data, file transfer and viewing data.

If Generation-Z obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, Generation-Z has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties. Generation-Z has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

1.8 Credit Card Information. Generation-Z may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card (Credit Card Information) when an individual completes certain surveys or places an order from Generation-Z. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to Generation-Z, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. Generation-Z will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase/survey transaction (if applicable), and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to Third Parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction. Log File Data: When users log-in to access their account, our servers will automatically record and archive certain information that web-browsers send whenever visiting a Website.
