Pryde Multimedia, LLC (at times herein, “CareersinMusic.com,” “we,” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to explain how CareersinMusic.com collects, uses and shares information from you when you use the CareersinMusic.com websites (collectively, the “Website”) and to help you make an informed decision as to whether to use or continue using the Website.

  2.  **What kinds of information do you collect from me?**



The amount and type of information we gather depends upon your use of the website and, in some cases, what type of information you choose to disclose. We may collect the following information from you:

 **(a) Survey Information.** We collect information from you when you voluntarily complete a CareersinMusic.com survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a “Survey”). (As used herein, online means using the Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and offline means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, we or a third party (a Third Party) may ask you to provide various information, which may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS/text messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS/text message), age, highest level of education, military status, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, “Survey Information”). We may also collect information concerning you from a third-party source and use that information in combination with information provided from this Website.

Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and you are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to us or a Third Party, but you may be offered or receive incentives from us in exchange for providing Survey Information.

 **(b) Information about Your Device and Internet Connection.** When you use the Website, we automatically gather information made available by your web browser (such as Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome), Internet service provider (such as Comcast or Time Warner), and device (such as your computer, phone, or tablet), depending on your settings for each. For example, we may collect your IP address, information about the operating system or type of device you use, and the location of your device.

 **(c) Information Provided by Third Parties.** CareersinMusic.com may obtain your information if you have provided it to a Third Party and we subsequently purchase, license, or otherwise acquire the information from the Third Party. Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS/text messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS/text message), age, highest level of education, military status, personal and online interests, and such other information as you may have provided to the Third Party (together, “Third Party List Information”). When acquiring Third Party List Information, we seek assurances from the Third Party that it has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to us and that it has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller’s list.

 **(d)** **Payment Information.** We may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card (“Credit Card Information”) when you complete certain surveys or place an order from CareersinMusic.com. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to us, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. We will only use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase/survey transaction (if applicable), and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to necessary Third Parties (such as our merchant processing vendors) only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.

 **(e) Other Information.** From time to time, we may obtain other information from you, such as when you make a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by CareersinMusic.com or by a Third Party, when you request assistance through from our customer service department, and when you voluntarily subscribe to a CareersinMusic.com service or newsletter. You will always be asked to provide such other information voluntarily, and we will not collect it without your permission.
