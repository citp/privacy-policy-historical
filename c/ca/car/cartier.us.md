This Privacy Notice describes the personal information we collect from our customers through the Cartier client relations center, online, over the telephone and in our boutiques.

**Personal Information Collection**  
In order to place an order through the website, you will be required to register and create an online account. During this process, you will be required to provide valid and up-to-date personal information, including but not limited to your real name, date of birth, phone number and e-mail address, as well as other personal information as applicable, such as shipping address, billing address and payment details (collectively "Personal Information").

Should you contact the client relations center by telephone, you may also be required to provide such Personal Information. Additionally, if you complete a customer card in one of our boutiques, the Personal Information you provide shall be used as described in this Privacy Notice.

Cartier takes the protection of your Personal Information very seriously and therefore additional information may be collected by Cartier or its third party providers for security and anti-fraud purposes (see further information below).

Any Personal Information you make available to Cartier is done so voluntarily, with your knowledge and consent when ordering creations or registering for  
services from Cartier. We will request from you information that is mandatory (required by us to fulfill your order and meet our legal obligations) and  
non-mandatory (which you can give to us if you chose); if you choose not to provide the mandatory information requested then Cartier may not be able to  
respond to your request or activate your option choices.

Cookies are pieces of electronic information stored on your computer. You may disable cookies through the settings in your web browser, but if you do so, some parts of our website may not function properly. We may automatically track and collect information about your IP address, domain service, the type of computer and web browser you are using and the pages you visit (including by using web beacon and other equivalent technology).

**Access to Personal Information**  
Except where stated otherwise, Cartier will not share your Personal Information with any unaffiliated third party without your prior consent or unless required to do by law or legal process.

  3. The identification of the creations you have ordered; 
  4. The price paid for the creations you have ordered;
