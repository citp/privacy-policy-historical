Introduction</h4><p>THIS IS A NEW PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH IS IN EFFECT AS OF December 13, 2018. BY USING THE SITE, YOU ACCEPT THESE NEW TERMS.</p><p>Careesma ("Careesma") has drafted its Privacy Policy to ensure that you can clearly understand our data and security practices and policies as you use Careesma's websites, apps and mobile services (the "Site" or "Sites"). This Privacy Policy describes the types of Personal Data we collect, how we use the information, with whom we share it, and the choices you can make about our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data. The phrase "Personal Data" refers to information that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number or other billing information. We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of your Personal Data and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.</p><p>This Privacy Policy incorporates by reference the Terms Of Use for the Sites, which apply to this Privacy Policy. When you visit the Sites or provide us with information, you consent to our use and disclosure of the information we collect or receive, as described in this Privacy Policy, unless separate terms are offered by you in writing and accepted in writing by Careesma.</p><p>Personal data (“Personal Data”) refers to any information that identifies you as a specific individual, and non-personal data (“Non-Personal Data”) refers to any information that does not identify you as a specific individual. Please note that at all times Careesma will adhere to the applicable statutory definition in determining what is and is not Personal Data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. Where this Privacy Policy refers to “information” or “your information” this may include both Personal and Non-Personal Data.</p><p>Please review this Privacy Policy periodically, as we may update it from time to time without prior notice to reflect changes in our data practices. We will post a notice on our Sites to notify you of any significant changes to our Privacy Policy and will indicate when it was most recently updated.</p><h4>2.

We also may collect aggregate demographic information. Such aggregate information may be collected from data that you have provided to us via usage of the Sites and/or public records, and is not unique to you nor is it linked to any Personal Data that can identify any individual person. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may share this aggregate information with third parties, including our affiliated and parent companies, for various reasons related to our business to assist them in targeting advertisements to appropriate audiences.</p><h6>– When You Log In or Use Careesma from Some Third-Party Sites</h6><p>You may also create an account or log in to your Careesma account using third-party websites including, but not limited to, Facebook or Google. If you do not already have a Careesma account but log in to Careesma using your Facebook or Google account, this creates an Careesma account using the same email address used in your Facebook or Google account. If you agree to provide this information to Careesma, Facebook or Google will authenticate you and redirect you to Careesma’s Site. Please note, when you log in to Careesma using your Facebook or Google account, Facebook or Google will cookie you in order to authenticate you as a Facebook or Google user.</p><p>By accessing Careesma through your Facebook or Google account, you understand that Facebook or Google will share certain data detailed above in this paragraph for the purposes of authentication to permit you to access our Site in a secure manner. You may stop this at any point from your Facebook or Google account. This information will be considered Careesma account information for purposes of your use of the Site.</p><p>You have the ability to disable the connection between your Facebook or Google account and your Careesma account at any time by accessing your privacy settings on your Facebook or Google account or from your Careesma account. Facebook may also ask for your permission to share certain other details with Careesma, including but not limited to your name, profile picture, public profile information, and email address.</p><p>PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH FACEBOOK OR GOOGLE OR ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE.</p><p>We may collect information stored in your social media profile that you authorize us to access when you use your social media profile to invoke features on the Sites. Careesma provides software applications ("Apps") available to the public. If you decide to download one of our Apps, we may collect your profile information, which will be limited to your social network site user ID, email address, name, and picture.</p><h5>2.2 Any Other Personal Data Careesma May Receive from Third Parties</h5><p>Any Personal Data that Careesma may obtain from other third-party sources will be processed by Careesma in accordance with this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws.</p><h5>2.3 Storage of your Information</h5><p>Careesma shall retain users’ Personal Data to the extent such retention is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. In particular, Careesma shall not retain Personal Data for any longer than necessary to perform the services outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>If you create a Careesma account, your information may be collected and stored in a manner that connects to your account email address. Careesma may also create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number. We may collect the name you have associated with your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name, email address, or zip code. The collection of this data is solely used in accordance with the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, to the extent applicable.</p><p>Careesma may also store the information detailed in section 2 of the Privacy Policy on its equipment or the equipment of third parties that Careesma has a relationship with. Such storage services will be governed by appropriate protections, as required by applicable rules.</p><h5>2.4 What Personal Data is Required</h5><p>Careesma will indicate to you at the point of provision as to whether or not particular Personal Data provided by you is required in order to provide particular Careesma services or features to you. Where Personal Data that is required is not provided by you then the particular feature or service may not be available to you.</p><h5>2.5 The Basis on Which Careesma Collects Your Personal Data</h5><p>Careesma collects and processes your Personal Data on the basis of different legal grounds, depending on the nature of the Personal Data being provided and the type of processing involved. More information is provided on this here.</p><h6>- Performance of a Contract</h6><p>Most of the Personal Data processed by Careesma is performed on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you, or in order to take steps at the request of the user prior to entering such an agreement.</p><h6>- Legitimate Interest</h6><p>A second ground relied upon by Careesma for other types of processing of your Personal Data is that it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by Careesma. Such legitimate interests will include where we believe you have a reasonable expectation that we will perform a particular type of processing on your behalf, or where such processing is strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention.</p><h6>- Compliance with a Legal Obligation</h6><p>A third ground relied upon for certain types of processing is that it is necessary in order to allow Careesma comply with a legal obligation.</p><h6>- Consent</h6><p>Finally, in certain limited situations, Careesma relies on your consent in order to process your Personal Data. Where Careesma requires your consent in order to collect and process certain Personal Data, we seek your consent at the time of provision, and such processing will only be performed where consent is secured.</p><h4>3. Limitation of Use or Disclosure of Personal Data</h4><h5>3.1 Where You Want to Close Your Account</h5><p>When you close your account, you will no longer have access to any of the data we make available under that account name. If you use the same email address to set up a new account, this data from a previous account will not become available to you again. Please also note that closing your account may result in you losing access to all Careesma products.</p><p>Careesma reserves the right to keep any materials in a closed account as necessary to preserve and protect its rights to the extent permitted by law (for example, to preserve records of a dispute) or to comply with its obligations under local law (for example, if requested to retain by law enforcement). A closed account does not mean that all of the data is expunged from the Careesma systems, although it will not be readily available under your original account name.</p><p>If you wish to access or delete your Personal Data held by Careesma, you should follow the steps listed in section 6 of this Privacy Policy, and such a request will be processed in accordance with applicable rules.</p><h5>3.2 Where You Want to Delete a Job Application</h5><p>If you want to delete a job application performed from Careesma’s Site, you are advised to contact the prospective Employer directly to request deletion of the application.</p><h5>3.3 Where the Employer Contact Details Provided to Careesma Are Incorrect</h5><p>In the event that the electronic destination provided to Careesma by an Employer is incorrect, your application materials will not be sent to the intended recipient of the application.

This helps us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. These service providers may only use or disclose the information as necessary to perform services on our behalf or as otherwise required by law.

Please also be aware that we may use third-party cloud service providers that provide hosting, data storage and other services pursuant to standard terms and conditions that may be nonnegotiable; these service providers have informed us or the general public that they apply security measures they consider adequate for the protection of information within their system, or they have a general reputation for applying such measures. However, we will not be liable (to the fullest extent permitted by law) for any damages that may result from the misuse of any information, including Personal Data, by these companies. Please see the section on International Data Transfers of this Privacy Policy for liabilities pertaining to the transfer of Personal Data of individuals in the EU and Switzerland.</p><h4>10.
