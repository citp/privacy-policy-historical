<p>CareerJunction maintains relationships with outside service providers for some of the services offered through our site, for example MyGate and Virtual Card Services (VCS).</p>
<p>The information these providers make available may be presented in a "framed" format, where the CareerJunction border will surround the pages served by the service provider, or where pages have the look and feel of CareerJunction. In either case, the service provider is prominently identified. Please be aware that any information you provide on those framed pages is provided directly to those service providers, not to <a href="http://www.careerjunction.co.za">http://www.careerjunction.co.za</a> and is subject to their security and privacy policies.
