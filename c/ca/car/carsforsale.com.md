### Personally Identifiable Information Sharing

We will use the personally identifiable information that you provide to us in any way that is legally permissible, including, without limitation, to provide services requested by you, to contact you regarding products and services, to conduct research and surveys, and to otherwise enhance your user experience.

If you are not a Dealer, the personally identifiable information you provide us may be shared with Dealers. For example, if you ask for more information on a vehicle, set an inventory alert, participate in Live Chat, or comment on a vehicle, we will share this information with Dealers. We may provide Dealers with your personally identifiable information if we believe, in our sole discretion, that you may be interested in any products or services offered by that Dealer based on your interactions with our Website. We may also serve as a conduit for messages, chat, emails, and other communications between Dealers (or other third parties) and you. 

We may store any of the information that you provide us indefinitely, including your personally identifiable information. This specifically includes, but is in no way limited to, the information you provide about yourself or a vehicle.
