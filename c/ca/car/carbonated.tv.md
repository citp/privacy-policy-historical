We have adopted this privacy policy to explain how we collect, store and use the information collected in connection with our Online Services (the "Privacy Policy").

This policy governs usage of the Carbonated.TV Website ("Site", "Website", "Carbonated", "Carbonated, Inc.", "Carbonated Site", "Carbonated.TV", or "Carbonated Website") found at the following URL: www.carbonated.tv and any other sites owned by Carbonated.TV (collectively, "Site").

This Privacy Policy is subject to the Carbonated.TV Terms & Conditions. Any issues or disagreements with this Privacy Policy or the Terms & Conditions are not to use the Carbonated.TV website and not upload or post any media, videos, comments, pictures, or any data whatsoever. The use of the Site after the Privacy Policy or Terms & Conditions has been modified, usage will signify acceptance of the changes that have been made and thus the new changes will govern usage and interaction with the Site.

This Privacy Policy explains how Carbonated.TV collects, uses, or otherwise processes information, including information that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”) and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of such information when you use our website: https://www.carbonated.tv, including on a mobile device, mobile application and related services (the “Service” or the “Services”) or any other service to which this policy is linked.

#### Who is the Data Controller?

Carbonated.TV is the “data controller” of personal data collected by all of Carbonated.TV or its entities; and responsible for deciding how personal data is collected, used, and disclosed. Our advertisers or sponsors may also be data controllers of certain data you provide to them when you consume the content.

You should be aware that when you provide information to us using a third-party site or platform, the information you provide may be separately collected by the third-party site or platform. The information we collect is covered by the Carbonated.TV Privacy Policy only, and the information the third-party site or platform collects is subject to the third-party site or platform’s privacy practices. Privacy choices you have made on the third-party site or platform will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through our Site or Services. Please also keep in mind that our Site and Services may contain links to other sites not owned or controlled by us and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site or Services and to read the policies of other sites that may collect your personal information.

If you use our blog or any community forum on our web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. Although, we are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information.

They may also object to our uses or disclosures of personal data, to request a restriction on its processing, or withdraw any consent, though such actions typically will not have retroactive effect. They also will not affect our ability to continue processing data in lawful ways (for example, if you opt out of the use of your telephone number for direct marketing, we might still decide to contact you by phone regarding potential fraud on your account).

Users in the European Economic Area have the right to opt-out of all of our processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes. To exercise this right, they may contact us.

We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. To dispose of personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Data may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.

####  Data transfers, storage, and processing globally
