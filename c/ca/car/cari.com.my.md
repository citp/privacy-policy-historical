# CARI - Privacy Policy

In general, when you visit our websites and access information you remain anonymous. Before we ask you for information, we will explain how this information will be used. We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission.

Some of our sites require registration to access, although typically all that's requested is an e-mail address and some basic information about you.

There are occasions where we will ask for additional information. We do this to be able to better understand your needs, and provide you with services that we believe may be valuable to you. Some examples of information our websites collect are name, email, home page address, and personal info. We give you the opportunity to elect not to receive materials from us.

If you sign up for CARI's electronic newsletter or e-mail list, each message will include instructions on how to "unsubscribe" from that list.
