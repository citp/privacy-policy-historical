At CareerBliss, we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by CyberCoders, LLC or its related companies (the "Services").

We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as our search functions. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information: 

  1. **Information You Provide.** When you register for an account with CareerBliss.com, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, e-mail address, and account password). We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. 
  2. **Log Information.** When you access CareerBliss services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web or search requests, Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request(s), and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. 
  3. **User Communications.** When you send e-mail or other communications to CareerBliss, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our services. 
  4. **Affiliated Services on Other Sites.** We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to CareerBliss in order to deliver the service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites through which our services are offered may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read those privacy policies. 
  5. **Other Sites.** This Privacy Policy applies to CareerBliss services only. We do not exercise control over sites linked to in advertisements, user-generated content, or web sites or services other than those offered directly from CareerBliss. 



CareerBliss only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In addition to the above, such purposes include:

  * Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising;
  * Auditing, research, and analysis in order to maintain, protect, and improve our services;
  * Ensuring the technical functioning of our network;
  * Protecting the rights or property of CareerBliss or our users; and
  * Developing new services



CareerBliss processes personal information on our services in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners.

When you register with CareerBliss, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask you for your consent prior to such use.

If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy, unless we have obtained your prior consent.

You can decline to submit personal information to CareerBliss, in which case we may not be able to provide all available services to you.

CareerBliss only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of CareerBliss in the following limited circumstances: 

  * We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
  * We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
  * We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy an applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of CareerBliss, its users, or the public as required or permitted by law.



If CareerBliss becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale or some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who have served for a particular term, for example. Such information does not identify you individually.

Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and process practices, and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

We restrict access to personal information to CareerBliss employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

CareerBliss processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage, and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.

When you use CareerBliss services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and he information requested to be accessed, corrected, or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform the service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.

CareerBliss regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or CareerBliss’s treatment of personal information by contacting us through the CareerBliss website or by writing to us at: 

6591 Irvine Center Drive, Suite 200  
Irvine, CA 92618

When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is CareerBliss’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between CareerBliss and an individual.

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page, and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including e-mail notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page.
