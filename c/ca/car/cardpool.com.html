        Blackhawk Consumer Privacy Policy
      </h2>
      <p>Last Updated: 11/2015</p>
      <h3>Introduction and Scope of Practices.</h3>
      <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies to Blackhawk Network Holdings, Inc. (“Blackhawk,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and its affiliates and subsidiaries worldwide, including, but not limited to, Blackhawk Network, Inc., Blackhawk Network California, Inc., Blackhawk Engagement Solutions, Inc., Cardpool, Inc., and CardLab, Inc.   The Policy applies any time you deal with Blackhawk, whether in person, by telephone, by mail, or at any online or mobile site or application that we own and control (“Site”). The only exception to this is if different practices are provided and state that they apply instead of this Policy.</p>
      <p>This Policy explains:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>how we collect, use, and share information from or about you;</li>
        <li>how our online advertisements (such as banner ads) on thirdparty sites treat data;</li>
        <li>your choices about our use of your personal information; and</li>
        <li>how you can access and update your information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sometimes, we appear on a site owned by a third party (like a Blackhawk page or handle on a social media site) or link to a third party site. When we do, that third party’s privacy policies and terms of use, not ours, will apply unless you are told otherwise. Also, some of Blackhawk’s services (“Services”) are offered through banks or other financial institutions. In those cases, the third parties’ policies will govern their use of consumer data.</p>
      <h3>Types of Information We Collect</h3>
      <p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”).</strong> PII means information or a combination of information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate a specific person. We may collect the following types of PII from you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact information, such as name, email address, mailing address, fax or phone number;</li>
        <li>Payment and financial information, such as credit or other payment card information, bank account, or billing address;</li>
        <li>Social Security Number or other national tax ID number</li>
        <li>Device geolocation (geographical location)</li>
        <li>Unique identifiers such as user name, account number, or password; and,</li>
        <li>Preference information such as product wish lists, order history, or marketing preferences.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sometimes, we may combine PII you provide with information from third-party sources. For example, we may confirm your address with the postal service or verify your personal information with a credit-reporting agency. We will treat the combined information in accordance with the terms of this Policy.</p>
      <p><strong>Other Information (“OI”).</strong> OI is any information other than PII that does not reveal your identity or directly relate to a person. We may collect the following OI from you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information about your business such as company name, company size, or business type;</li>
        <li>Demographic information, such as age, gender, interests and ZIP code;
        </li><li>Device and other tracking information, such as browser information, device identifiers, operating system, or information gained from cookies, pixels or other tracking technologies.
      </li></ul>
      <p>OI may also include PII we have de-identified or aggregated to the point where it no longer identifies a particular individual. If we ever combine OI with any PII, we treat it as PII is treated under this Policy. In some jurisdictions, some OI may be considered PII by law. In those cases, we will treat the information as PII is treated under this Policy.</p>
      <h3>How We Collect Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
      <p>We collect PII when you provide it to us.&nbsp; This can occur when you fill out applications, create accounts, send in forms, take surveys, or fill in various online fields on our Sites. We also collect PII when you contact us with inquiries, customer support requests, or employment applications.</p>
      <p>We may also collect the PII of third parties when you provide it to us. If you choose to use our service to send a gift to a friend or register a family member for an account, we will ask you for your their name and address or email address. Blackhawk stores this information for the sole purpose of completing the transaction. If you provide PII of a friend or family member and they want us to delete this information, they should contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@bhnetwork.com">privacy@bhnetwork.com</a>.  We may not always be able to remove their PII. We will let them know if we cannot do so and why.</p>
      <h3>How We Use Personally Identifiable Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>We may use PII we collect for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>to provide you with the Services you requested;</li>
        <li>to verify your identity and/or location in order to allow access to your accounts, conduct online transactions, and secure your PII;</li>
        <li>to send you important information, such as changes to terms, conditions, and policies and/or other administrative information;</li>
        <li>to respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests;</li>
        <li>to track referrals from partner websites;</li>
        <li>to personalize your experience on a Site by presenting content or offers tailored to you;</li>
        <li>to send you marketing communications you have signed up for or that we believe may be of interest to you;</li>
        <li>to allow you to use various Site features.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Please note that some features require that you provide PII in order to use them (e.g.,&nbsp;many of the features at www.paypower.com) whereas other tools do not (e.g.,the features in the GoWallet application). You may request that certain information that you enter into our Sites be stored for future access and use. You have the option not to save the information;</li>
        </ul>
        <li>to assist in verifying your identity and account status when we deal with you through our social media pages . We may combine this information with information we already have;</li>
        <li>to enable you to post your resume, search job postings, and contact or be contacted by Blackhawk for prospective employment;</li>
        <li>for business purposes, including data analysis, audits, developing and improving products and services, enhancing our Sites, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of promotional campaigns; and.</li>
        <li>for risk control, fraud detection and prevention, and compliance with laws and regulations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Blogs:</strong> Some of our Sites offer publicly accessible blogs. Any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@bhnetwork.com">privacy@bhnetwork.com</a>. We may not always be able to remove your personal information. We will let you know if we cannot do so and why.</p>
      <p><strong>Newsletters:</strong> If you subscribe to our newsletters, we will use your name and email address to send them to you. You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or accessing the email preferences in your account.</p>
      <p><strong>Testimonials:</strong> We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on some of our Sites and in print advertisements. With your consent, we may use your testimonial and your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@bhnetwork.com">privacy@bhnetwork.com</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Geolocation:</strong> We may collect your location-based information to help you locate a store offering our products and services in your area. We will only share this information with our mapping provider for the sole purpose of providing you this service.  </p>
      <p>On some Sites (for example, <a href="//www.reloadit.com">www.reloadit.com</a>), we collect location-based information for fraud prevention purposes. </p>
      <p>You may opt out of location-based services at any time by changing the settings on your device. If you do, you might not be able to use certain features, especially when we use location-based information to prevent fraud.</p>
      <h3>How We Share Personally Identifiable Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>We will share your PII with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.  We do not sell PII to third parties.</p>
      <p><strong>Affiliates:</strong> To the extent permitted by law, we may provide information about your transactions and experiences with other affiliated Blackhawk entities, including parent companies and subsidiaries.</p>
      <p><strong>Service providers:</strong> We may provide your PII to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities, such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your PII only as necessary to provide these services.</p>
