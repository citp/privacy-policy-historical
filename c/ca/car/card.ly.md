## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. This document explains how we use private information collected, and your rights and responsibilities regarding your private information. This privacy policy will always be available on our website for you to review. 

## The Information We Collect

As a matter of course and functionality, software on our website will track data deemed non-personal, such as IP Address.

If you register an account on our website, we will also collect your email address, in order to be able to communicate with you better regarding our site.

If you purchase our software, while we do not directly collect payment information from you, our payment processor will send to us certain personally-identifiable information in order to match your transaction and provide a log of payments received through the processor. This information can include, but is not limited to:

  * Address
  * Email address
  * Phone number



We do not directly collect banking or credit card information, and will never have this information stored in our system. Our payment processor may send us a masked copy of your credit or debit card number, however (such as the last 4 digits of your card number).

## The Way We Use Information

We do not directly collect your banking or credit card information when you place an order with us, and as such we do not store this information in our records (outside of the basic log data sent to us by the payment processor). Any information we collect or log will not be shared with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete your order.

Your email address is used to send you notifications about changes to our website (for example to alert you that a new message is waiting for you) and will not be used for any other purpose. Additionally, you can log into your Control Panel, and elect not to receive notifications from the administrator. Only under extremely rare and important circumstances would we override this election on your part when contacting you.

We may use generic statistical information to better enhance our site. For example, we may group activity on our site based on gender, geographical location, or age - however at no time when reviewing statistical information would we use or supply personally identifying information such as your name or address.

Any information submitted to us during registration, ordering, or normal use of our website will not be used for any purpose other than for it's stated intentions, except as outlined above.

## Our Commitment to Data Security

We make every attempt to secure the information and data we have collected through our site. This includes maintaining necessary security updates for the software in use, and implementing practices and policies to prevent unauthorized access to personal information.

## How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information

If you would like for us to change this information for you, we require that you login to the site, and send a personal message to an administrator, to confirm your account security. We may take other necessary or precautionary steps to ensure your account has not been compromised as we deem necessary.
