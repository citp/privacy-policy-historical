# Privacy policy | The Caravan Club

The Caravan Club Limited, company number 646027, the registered office and correspondence address is East Grinstead House, London Road, East Grinstead, West Sussex, RH19 1UA, United Kingdom ('The Caravan Club') has developed this privacy policy as we understand that the privacy and security of your personal information is an important issue to you.

This privacy policy explains what personal information we will collect from you and how it will be used.

If you do not agree with this privacy policy and the terms of use policy please do not use this website.

What personal information do we collect and how do we use it?

The Data Protection Act 1998 ('the 1998 Act') places restrictions on the processing of personal data by a data controller. The terms processing, personal data, sensitive personal data and data controller are defined in the 1998 Act.

We collect personal information from you when you communicate with us by any media. We may also collect personal data which relates to you from third parties.

Depending on your relationship with The Caravan Club ('The Club'), we shall process your personal data for the following purposes:

  * to administer your membership
  * to administer your enquiries about The Club and purchases of Club (and third party) products and services
  * to transfer to third parties who provide services to The Club and/or members
  * to provide information to you about The Club and membership benefits provided by The Club and third parties
  * to send electronic marketing communications with your explicit consent
  * to carry out research
  * the general objectives of The Club
  * statutory and regulatory compliance



The Club is only permitted to process your personal data if a condition set out in the 1998 Act applies allowing such processing. If no condition applies, we can only undertake processing with your consent. In many cases we are obliged by law to process your personal data for a specified number of years (e.g. if you purchase goods and/or services from us); therefore, if you withdraw any consent from us to process your personal data, it will only apply to processing we undertake for direct marketing purposes.

Any personal information you give to us will be treated in the strictest confidence.

The Club may continue to process your personal data after you have ceased to be a member of The Club or we have sent you any information requested by you.

We also use software to analyse how you interact with our website.  Any information collected in this manner is automatically anonymised.

We use "cookies" on this site to enable our system to recognise your computer and allow us to see how you use our site.  Most browsers allow you to stop receiving cookies via option / settings.  However, you should be aware that if you do disable cookies, you will not be able to login into member-only areas.

## Sensitive personal information

Certain personal information is categorised by the 1998 Act as 'sensitive personal data'. In some circumstances, we provide you with the opportunity to inform us of your sensitive personal data e.g. whether or not you are registered as disabled. You may also wish to inform us about your sensitive personal data to ensure that we can provide you with the most appropriate service. By providing us with this data you are consenting to our processing it for the purposes for which it was given e.g. the allocation of an appropriate pitch at the National Rally.

Please note that if you fail to inform us of any sensitive personal data which may be relevant to your circumstances, this may mean that we cannot provide you with the most appropriate service.

## Sharing your information

If you do not wish us to share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes, please write to Membership Services at The Club's address below, or call                             01342 318813.

## Member surveys

From time to time we ask our members to complete research surveys so we can improve the service given to them.  Your response to such surveys is voluntary and confidential and will be used only for internal planning and development purposes.

## Access to your personal information

You can find out what personal information we hold on you by sending a written request to:

The Compliance Officer  
The Caravan Club  
East Grinstead House  
East Grinstead  
West Sussex  
RH19 1UA  
United Kingdom

You will receive a reply as soon as practicable provided that we do not require proof of your identity.  We reserve the right to charge you an administration fee of £10, payable by a postal order or a personal cheque made payable to The Caravan Club Limited and sent by first class post to the above address, in relation to each request that you make.

If we request payment of the administration fee then we will not reply until after we have received your postal order or your cheque has cleared.  If any personal information held by The Caravan Club is inaccurate or you wish to make any changes to personal information previously submitted to us, please write to our Compliance Officer at the above address clearly explaining what amendments you wish to be made.

## Changes to the privacy policy

From time to time we may add new features to the website and enhance the level of service that we offer to you.  This may lead to changes in how we collect and/or use your personal information.  Any such changes will be notified to you either at the point any new personal information is collected or by us updating this privacy policy.  Your subsequent use of this website or submission of personal information to us will be deemed to signify your acceptance to the changes.

## Security and confidentiality

Any personal information you send to us will be treated in the strictest confidence.

Where you are required to submit sensitive information to us, e.g. banking details, we use encryption technology to minimise the risk of unauthorised access to and improper use of your personal information.  However, please be aware that despite the security measures we have in place no computer system is completely secure and there is always some degree of risk whenever personal information is transferred.

We will not disclose your personal information to any Government agencies or authorities except if required to do so by law.

## Links to other websites

The Caravan Club website provides links to other websites that offer products, services and materials we think will be of interest to you. Some of these websites are operated in conjunction with other companies/organisations and some are operated solely by independent companies/organisations. In particular, although The Caravan Club administers and governs the Regional and Centre caravanning groups organised by its members it does not own or control the websites operated by these groups in any way.  No linked websites are covered by this privacy policy, therefore, you should check what data protection measures they have in place before submitting any personal information to them.

## Direct marketing

You have the right under the 1998 Act to request that we do not process your personal data for the purposes of direct marketing. If you would prefer that we cease to send you direct marketing information please write to Membership Services at The Club's address below or call 01342 318 813.

Please note that if you make such a request, you will continue to receive communications relating to the administration of your membership and any services purchased.

## Monitoring of telephone calls and e-mails

Your telephone calls and e-mails to us may be recorded and monitored for quality control purposes.
