The Caravan Club Limited ( **We** ) are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

This policy (together with our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use/ "Terms and conditions") and any other documents referred to in it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our policy and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. By visiting our digital services you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this policy.

For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998, the data controller is The Caravan Club Limited and our Data Security Compliance Manager is our nominated person for data protection.

### 3.2. How do we collect information?

We obtain personal information from you when you enquire about our activities, register with us, become a member or renew membership, send or receive email, make a donation of memorabilia to us, purchase products, ask a question or otherwise provide us with personal information. We may also receive information about you from third parties, for example from our service providers or from a friend who wants to tell you about our digital services.

### 3.3. What information do we collect?

The personal information we collect will depend on the nature of the transaction. It might include name, date of birth, email address, postal address, telephone number and bank account details. Although we may take credit/debit card information to complete a transaction, we do not store this information.

Certain personal information is categorised by the Data Protection Act 1998 as ‘sensitive personal data’. In some circumstances, we provide you with the opportunity to inform us of your sensitive personal data, e.g. whether or not you are registered as disabled. You may also wish to inform us about your sensitive personal data to ensure that we can provide you with the most appropriate service. By providing us with this data you are consenting to our processing it for the purposes for which it was given, e.g. the allocation of an appropriate pitch at the National Rally. Please note that if you fail to inform us of any sensitive personal data which may be relevant to your circumstances, this may mean that we cannot provide you with the most appropriate service.

We also gather general information about the use of our digital services, such as which pages users visit most often and which services, events or facilities are of most interest. We may also track which pages users visit when they click on links in emails. We may use this information to personalise the way our digital services are presented when users visit them, to make improvements to our digital services and to ensure we provide the best service for users. Wherever possible we use aggregated or anonymous information which does not identify individual visitors to our digital services. For more information on this, please see our [Use of Cookies](https://web.archive.org/site-help/cookies/ "Cookies") policy.

### 3.4. Cookies

Our digital services use cookies to distinguish you from other users of our digital services. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our digital services and also allows us to improve our digital services. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them see our [Use of Cookies](https://web.archive.org/site-help/cookies/ "Cookies") policy.

As part of this, we may analyse the personal information we collect to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that we can contact you in the most appropriate way and with the most relevant information. Where relevant, we may also assess your personal information for the purposes of fraud and credit risk reduction.

If you enter your contact details in one of our online registration forms, we may use this information to contact you even if you do not "send" or "submit" the form. We will only do this to see if we can help with any problems you might be experiencing with the form or with our digital services.
