Overview   
CareerMidEast.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We want to provide a safe and secure user experience. We will exert our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private, and is used only for the purposes set forth herein. The following reflects our commitment to you.   
General Information Disclosure   
We do not disclose information about your individual visits to CareerMidEast.com, or personal information that you provide (such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, etc.) to any outside parties, except when it is clear to users that this information will be made public or when we believe the law requires it.   
Information About All CareerMidEast.com Visitors   
In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access the most. We only use such data in the aggregate, to help us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for you. We may share this collective information with our partners, so that they too may understand how all CareerMidEast.com users use our career areas and our site. This will help our partners create a better overall experience for you, as well.   
Information About You Specifically   
In some instances, such as when you sign up to use a service, enter into a contest, or purchase a product, we may need more specific information about you (such as name, address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, type of computer, etc.). We may use that information to make you aware of additional products and services that may be of interest to you, or to contact you regarding site changes. We may also ask you for other information, such as information on your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, the types of jobs you are interested in, etc., in an effort to offer you the best possible site experience.   
PLEASE NOTE:   
ANY contact information, such as names, telephone numbers, website links, etc, cannot be included in content that appears on the site. (This information should only be entered when asked for it). Such content includes, but is not limited to, company profiles, job vacancies and resumes.   
When posting company profiles, job vacancies and resumes, no information may be included specifying physical attributes. This includes, but is not limited to, comments about veils (hijab), looks and beauty. Such comments are discriminatory and will not be supported by CareerMidEast.com. Discrimination based on, but not limited to, sex, religion and race will also not be supported.   
This is to protect our users and the credibility of the services we provide. This is valid for employers, recruiters and job seekers.   
How Can Other Parties Have Access To My Contact Information   
As a job seeker, an employer, headhunter, recruiter, training centers or other subscribers may have your contact information if you have allowed them to (this option is available when adding your resume and when modifying it), or when applying to a job and allowing them to see your phone numbers, or if you provide them with it.   
As an employer, recruiter, training centers or any other subscribed member, job seekers may acquire your contact information if you provide it to them or through external means by knowing the company name (this is a case beyond our control).   
Your Company Profile (for employers, recruiters, training centers and other subscribed members)   
Since CareerMidEast.com is an online recruitment site, we give you the option of putting your company information in our database. If you post your profile and job vacancies, then all job seekers with resumes on our site will have access to them, with all contents, unless specified as otherwise (Your email will not be revealed to seekers unless you give it to them). However, we are not responsible if some other third party, such as someone posing as the afore-mentioned. However, job seekers with resumes on CareerMidEast.com may continue contacting you because they may have retained a copy of a previously posted job vacancy. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of your company information in these instances.  
When choosing to 'Hide Your Company Profile' from job seekers when adding a job vacancy, your company profile is not linked to that specific job, but if /when a seeker searches companies, your profile will be included for viewing.   
Resumes (for job seekers)   
Since CareerMidEast.com is a career site, we give you the option of putting your resume in our database. If you post your resume, then all subscribed members who pay for access to our resume database product will have access to your resume, unless you have hidden it. We exert our best efforts to only grant access to this database to paying recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals. However, we are not responsible if some other third party, such as someone posing as the afore-mentioned and paying for the service, evades security measures and gains access to the database, and, subsequently, your resume. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time by hiding it. However, recruiters who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resume in these instances.   
Feedback   
CareerMidEast.com has an area on the site where you can submit feedback. Any feedback that is submitted through this area becomes the property of CareerMidEast.com. We may use this feedback, such as success stories, for marketing purposes, or to contact you for further feedback on the site.   
Privacy Commitment Changes
