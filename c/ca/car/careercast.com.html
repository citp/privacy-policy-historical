Any other visitors to Adicio.com should refer to the Online Privacy Policy which covers non-ASP Adicio, Inc. website use.</p>
<p>We operate as a data processor for our hosted recruitment, real estate and motors software customers. Our hosted software customers fill the role of data controller. Individual users involved in recruitment, real estate or motors activities usually interact directly with Adicio, Inc.'s customers rather than with Adicio, Inc. Adicio, Inc. provides its customers the option of disclosing their relationship with us by providing notice to individual employees, candidates, agents, brokers, buyers, sellers and dealers of the customer about the Adicio, Inc. technology that they use. Adicio, Inc. maintains only that information related to the user process, which our customers' have asked us to process. This ASP Privacy Policy does not reflect the privacy practices of Adicio, Inc.'s customers and Adicio, Inc. is not responsible for its customers' privacy policies or practices.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Notice/Use of Information</h4>
<p>Because it supplies a hosted system, Adicio, Inc. operates as a data processor for our software customers. Our hosted software customers fill the role of data collector. Individual users involved in recruitment, real estate or motors activities usually interact directly with Adicio, Inc.'s customers rather than with Adicio, Inc. Adicio, Inc. provides its customers with the option of disclosing their relationship with us by providing notice to individual employees and candidates of the customer about the Adicio, Inc. technology that they use. Adicio, Inc. maintains only that information related to the recruitment, real estate or motors process, which our customers have asked us to process. It is the Adicio, Inc. customer's responsibility to ensure that the data the customer collects can be legally collected in the country of origin. The Adicio, Inc. customer is responsible to give its users the appropriate level of notification that Personal Information is being collected and maintained. Adicio, Inc. does collect aggregate and demographic data, which is not associated with an individual's Personal Information, that may be used for statistical analysis and training purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Notification of Changes/Choice</h4>
<p>We will maintain information in accordance with this ASP Privacy Policy. If we decide to change this Policy, we will post the changes on this page so that our software customers or their users are always aware of what information we process, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use Personal Information in a different manner, we will notify our customers by way of email or by posting a notice on our website for at least 30 days prior to the change in use. Customers, in turn, are responsible for notifying users and providing them a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. Onward Transfer</h4>
<p>We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include customer service; information processing, and data storage. If we disclose information of our customers or customers' users to a third party that is acting as our agent or on our behalf, we will ensure that the third party has agreed to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us and abide by the Safe Harbor principles or is subject to the Data Directive, or can otherwise assure adequate protection of such information. We may seek to assure adequate protection, for example, by entering into written agreements with third parties requiring such parties to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Safe Harbor and/or the Data Directive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4. Data Integrity</h4>
<p>Adicio, Inc. will use Personal Information only in ways compatible with the purpose for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by our customers. Adicio, Inc. will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is relevant for its intended use, accurate and complete.</p>
