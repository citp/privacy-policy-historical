> 1\. We disclose information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you indicate that you would like to receive information about the opportunities, products or services of third parties at the time you register for an account, we supply your contact information to third parties such as employers, recruiters, data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or otherwise communicating with you. We use data we have about you (such as the interests and preferences you have expressed) to determine whether you might be interested in the opportunities, products or services of a particular third-party.

> 2\. We disclose information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting our Web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party.

> 3\. We disclose information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.

> 4\. We disclose and transfer information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of our business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, we or our trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. You will be notified of sale of all or a substantial portion of our business to a third party via email or through a prominent notice posted on the CareerCast.com Site.

If you have a CareerCast.com profile, other users or members of CareerCast.com may access your profile, however, they will not have access to your contact information and your contact information is not displayed in any CareerCast.com profile.

**Other Uses of Information**

We also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to CareerCast.com (for example, the number of new profiles created) with its clients, partners and other third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the CareerCast.com Site and how those visitors use the CareerCast.com Site. We may also aggregate on an anonymous basis data regarding job qualifications, schooling, age, experience level or other information relevant to the job search or competition among Seekers for any such job. Such data may be made available to employers or fellow job seekers.

We supply technology, hosting and related services to other leading companies to power recruitment areas on their Web sites (sometimes referred to as "Hosted Career Sites"). Personal and/or demographic information supplied by you in Hosted Career Sites becomes part of the CareerCast.com database, but it is not accessible by anyone other than you, CareerCast.com and the company concerned without your consent. If you attempt to register with CareerCast.com after registering with a Hosted Career Site, CareerCast.com will recognize your information and you will be able to use the information you provided to the Hosted Career Site in your CareerCast.com account registration.

Information gathered on a page in a Hosted Career Site, may become the property of the other company or of both us and the other company. In that instance, the use of such information by the other company will be subject to the privacy policy of that company. We are not responsible for that company's use of your personal or demographic information.

If you apply for a position on CareerCast.com or through a Hosted Career Site, you may be asked to provide information on your gender, race or other protected status where permitted by applicable law.

All information provided will be kept separate from your expression of interest in any job opportunity. Providing this information is strictly voluntary and you will not be subject to any adverse action or treatment if you choose not to provide this information.

**Personal Information on Resumes and Profiles**

Since CareerCast.com is a career site, we give you three options regarding the accessibility of your resume:

> 1\. You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it to be searchable by potential employers. Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume database product.

> 2\. If you allow your resume to be searchable without making it confidential and hiding your contact information, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume.

> 3\. If you have a confidential resume, but apply to a job posting on CareerCast.com, the employer to whom you send your resume will be able to view your contact information.

In addition, portions of your searchable resume (but not your contact information) may be made public in your CareerCast.com profile.

We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. However, the portions of your searchable resume (not your contact information) that are automatically made public in your CareerCast.com profile are accessible to anyone who uses the CareerCast.com profile service. You may remove your resume from CareerCast.com or delete your profile on CareerCast.com at anytime, but, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to the CareerCast.com resume database or to obtain a copy of that database or have paid for access to the CareerCast.com services, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access may have retained a copy of your resume or CareerCast.com profile in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles in these instances.

**Posting to Public Areas of CareerCast.com**

Please remember that if you post any of your personal information in public areas of CareerCast.com, such as in online forums, blogs, chat rooms, or in the CareerCast.com searchable resume database, such information may be collected and used by others over whom we have no control. We are not responsible for the use made by third parties of information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of CareerCast.com.
