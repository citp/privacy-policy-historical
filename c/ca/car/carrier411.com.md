Collection of Information   
You may be asked to voluntarily provide your name, address, phone number, fax number, credit card number, email address or other personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") to subscribe or to have access to some features of the Site. By using the Site and providing us with your Personal Information, you consent to our use of such information as described in this Policy. You may always refuse to provide your Personal Information, and this may lead to our inability to provide you with certain services. We or our business partners may also collect information that is anonymous, such as your IP address (a number used to identify your computer on the Internet) or the type of browser you are using ("Anonymous Information"), through the use of cookies or by other means. We hope that, by using Anonymous Information, we can update the Site to make it more useful to you and other users. We reserve the right to maintain, update, disclose or otherwise use Anonymous Information without limitation. 

Monitoring List   
One of the many benefits of using Carrier411 is the ability to monitor carriers (and brokers) your company uses, get custom reports about their status, and be alerted to changes in authority, insurance, safety and performance issues. In order to monitor companies with Carrier411, you need to maintain a list through our Site, which we refer to as your Monitoring List ("Monitoring List"). 

Carrier411 Services, Inc. treats your Monitoring List as highly confidential information. Accordingly, we neither disclose nor release information about your Monitoring List to customers or any other party, unless required by law. Simply put, your Monitoring List is not available for other Carrier411 customers to access or obtain. The only people who can access information about your Monitoring List are the Carrier411 staff of professionals, and your trusted employees who have been granted access (by your company) to use your Carrier411 account. In a related manner, we trust your company will help guard its account by carefully controlling authorized access. Please restrict access to your Carrier411 account by limiting it to trusted company employees. Should any employee who knows your account username and password leave your company for any reason, we highly encourage you to change your account username and password immediately for security reasons.

Carrier411 Services, Inc. uses your Personal Information for the following purposes: to process your order and administer your account; to administer and improve the Site and related services; to notify you of our products, services, promotional events or special offers that may be of interest to you; to provide Internet security; and to meet legal requirements. Carrier411 Services, Inc. may work with our business partners who may perform certain functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, sending email messages, managing data, processing credit card payments or providing customer service. These business partners have access to your Personal Information only to the extent necessary to perform these specific functions and may not use it for any other purpose. Other than for the specific purposes set forth in this Policy, we will not disclose your Personal Information unless we obtain your prior consent or are legally required to do so. We may use third-party advertising companies to place ads on the Site and to place our ads on other websites. These companies may use Anonymous Information about your visits to this and other websites to provide advertisements on the Site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If Carrier411 Services, Inc. is involved in the sale of a substantial portion of its business assets, Anonymous or Personal Information may be among the transferred assets.
