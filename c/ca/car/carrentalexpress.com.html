<h2>Disclosure</h2>
<p>Car Rental Express will disclose your personal information only if required to do so by law, in the good faith belief that doing so protects the property of Car Rental Express, or to protect the safety of our employees and their families.</p>
<h2>Control of your Personal Information</h2>
<h3 id="choice-opt-out">Choice and Opt-out</h3>
<p>We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you reserve a vehicle but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form. If you do not wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:optout@carrentalexpress.com">optout@carrentalexpress.com</a>. We also offer an opportunity to opt-out on our member information page (<a href="/members">http://www.carrentalexpress.com/members</a>)</p>
<p>You will be notified before personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.</p>
<h2>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service(s), you may edit your information or opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:optout@carrentalexpress.com">optout@carrentalexpress.com</a>. We also offer an opportunity to opt-out on our member information page (<a href="/members">http://www.carrentalexpress.com/members</a>)</p>
<h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our reservation forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link: <a href="http://www.geotrust.com">http://www.geotrust.com</a>. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send an email to us at <a href="mailto:support@carrentalexpress.com">support@carrentalexpress.com</a>.</p>
<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>Your information is stored in Canada, and in the future may be stored in any country where Car Rental Express has facilities. The same privacy policy will apply to your information no matter in which country it is stored.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use session ID cookie on this site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser or leave the browser idle for 30 minutes. We do not use persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site.</p>
<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Car Rental Express. Please be aware that we, Car Rental Express, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.</p>
<h2>Co-branded sites</h2>
<p>Car Rental Express co-brands with car rental agencies world-wide. All these agencies are under contract with Car Rental Express either individually or through marketing associations. Personally identifiable information collected by Car Rental Express for the purpose of a vehicle rental reservation is given to the selected car rental agency. This information is used only to process and facilitate the reservation and subsequent rental. This information is stored in Car Rental Express' database. Making the reservation is voluntary. If you do not want your personally identifiable information shared with your chosen car rental agency, please do not make the reservation through our automated system.</p>
<h2>Business Transitions</h2>
<p>In the event Express Internet Technologies Inc. goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email and prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. You will be able to notify us if you do not wish your personally identifiable information to be transferred. You may email us at <a href="mailto:info@carrentalexpress.com">info@carrentalexpress.com</a>, write us at Express Internet Technologies Inc.</p>
<p>7 - 15715 34th Avenue Surrey, BC, CANADA, V3S 0J6</p>
<h2>The Nature of Express Internet Technologies Inc. Business</h2>
<p>Express Internet Technologies Inc. (ExpressITech or EIT) is the parent company of Car Rental Express.com (CRX). ExpressITech provides reservation software services to Car-Rental Agencies (Agencies). This software system is called the Revolution Reservation System, and it powers reservations both on CRX and at private Agency web sites.</p>
<p>Car Rental Agencies are the direct customers of ExpressITech. Visitors to the Car Rental Express.com web site are direct customers of the Car Rental Agencies represented at the CRX site. ExpressITech functions much like the Yellow Pages does, enabling access to business services by the general public. The ExpressITech Better Business Bureau (BBB) accreditation is dependent on the relationship between ExpressITech and its Car Rental Agency customers. ExpressITech applies fair and reasonable business practices to its Agency customer base. ExpressITech.com support and contact information is directed to these Agencies.</p>
<p>When a renter experiences a difficulty with a particular Agency, either at CRX, or at the Agency web site, then the renter must resolve that issue with the Agency, with whom the renter has a direct business relationship. Agency business policies appear online to assist with that process. In the case where a renter raises a concern to ExpressITech or Car Rental Express.com, regarding a specific Agency or renting experience, then it is ExpressITech's role to forward that concern to the specified Agency. ExpressITech's role is one of facilitating and monitoring communications, not one of intervention or problem resolution.</p>
<h2>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>
