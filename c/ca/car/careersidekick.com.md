# Privacy Policy • Career Sidekick

_Last modified: May 17, 2018_

CareerSidekick.com is committed to ensuring your privacy is protected.

This document outlines our privacy guidelines, to which you agree by navigating this site. Regular updates of the privacy policy are completed, requiring you to check back on this policy from time to time.

### What Information Do We Collect?

**Personal Data.** Personal Data is information that identifies a particular individual. In order for us to provide service to you, we may collect the following Personal Data from you:

  * Your first and last name
  * Your email address



We collect this information from you when you subscribe to our email newsletter, order one of our products, or fill out a form on our website.

If you leave a comment on the website, we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

You may, however, visit our site anonymously.

**Other Data.** When you visit our website, we want to make it easy, useful and reliable. To do this, we also collect other information which does *not* identify you. We do this in the following ways/methods:

  * Google Analytics
  * Server Logs



More information on each can be found below:

**Google Analytics.** Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are small text files placed on your computer, to collect standard internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form – no personally identifiable information is collected about you unless you explicitly submit that information to us. Google Analytics is a free tool that lets us see what’s going on with our website traffic, where our visitors are coming from and what are they doing on our website. Most web browsers allow you to turn off cookies. To do this look at the “help” menu on your browser. Switching off cookies may restrict the use of the Service and/or delay or affect the way in which it operates.

**Server logs.** We use server log information for purposes such as calculating site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with CareerSidekick’s servers and administering CareerSidekick.com. These server logs may include information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, host name, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, the time(s) of your visit(s) and the web page(s) that you visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.

### What Do We Do With This Information?

Any of the information we collect may be used in the following ways:

  * To improve our website and user experience.
  * To respond to your customer service requests and inquiries.
  * To process transactions and fulfill our obligation to you when you order a product or request information from us.
  * To send periodic emails- the email address you provide may be used to send you information about relevant products and services. You can change your mind later with regard to receiving emails from us by contacting us at any time. We also include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email we send.



### How Do We Keep Your Personal Data Safe?

In order to keep your Personal Data and all the other information we have stored safe, we have implemented various security measures and taken reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration, destruction or disclosure of your Personal Data.

Your Personal Data will be stored in a secure environment and treated confidentially. We will, however, use a hosting provider to store data, including Personal Data. The hosting provider may not use your Personal Data for any other purposes besides storing it, and we require the hosting provider to act consistently with this Privacy Policy and to use appropriate security measures to protect your Personal Data.

We will take all reasonable precautions to ensure that our staff and employees who have been specifically granted access to information about you have received adequate training to ensure that they process that information only in accordance with this policy and with our obligations under applicable legislations.

### Do We Disclose Any Personal Data to Outside Parties?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties, with exception to third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, after confirming these parties agree to keep this information confidential.

We may, however, release personal information when required to do so by law enforcement, or in cases where it’s necessary in order to comply with the law.

Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

We make every effort possible to only use data processors and third party companies that are compliant with GDPR and other international privacy regulations.

### How Long We Retain Your Data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

If you order one of our products, the transaction log is also retained indefinitely. This is so we can provide customer support and verify that you did indeed purchase said product if any customer support issues or questions arise in the future.

If you provide your email address on our website, the details you submit are retained indefinitely so we can continue to provide service and information. We will refresh consent every 2 years to ensure we still have your permission to email you.

Google Analytics user and event data is retained for 50 months from the last visit.
