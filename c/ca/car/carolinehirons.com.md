# Caroline Hirons: Legal Stuff/Privacy Policy

**LEGAL STUFF**

**Advice**  
The views expressed on this site are the author's own and are provided for informational purposes only. The author makes no warranties about the suitability of any product or treatment referenced or reviewed here for any person other than herself and any reliance placed on these reviews or references by you is done so solely at your own risk. Nothing on this site shall be construed as providing dermatological, medical or other such advice and you are always advised to seek the advice of a suitable professional should you have any such concerns.  
**  
****Affiliates**  
Some links may be affiliates. This is new to me so I'm monitoring how it goes. It doesn't affect my opinion at all, but then I think regular readers will know that. ;)  
Any sponsored content has always and _will_ always be clearly labelled according to the ASA guidelines.

**Hall of Fame and Product Placement**  
Whilst I do occasional sponsored placement content, the Hall of Fame is not for sale. It is given to products I love, not brands that have money to spend.

**Product Recommendations Disclaimer**  
I am always happy to recommend products and this has obviously become a key part of the blog and now YouTube. Any recommendation is based on my experience with something - or the trusted experience of a tester - but everyone's skin is different and something that works for me may not necessarily work for you in the same way.  
The same with allergic reactions - it is impossible to anticipate allergies - it is pretty much possible for anyone to be allergic to anything.

**Adverts**  
Adverts placed on here are done so by MODE Media and I have no affiliation with the companies featured.  
To provide the best browsing experience, this site uses cookies and by visiting this site you are agreeing to the use of cookies. For more information on the EU e-Privacy Directive or how to disable cookies click here.
