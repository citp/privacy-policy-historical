**Answers**

**Does Care2 ask for personal information?**

Yes. Care2 asks for your name and other personal information when you sign up for our services. 

**Does Care2 ask for credit card information? When?**

Care2 allows you to use your credit card to become a **[Care2 Charter Member](https://commerce1.care2.com/charter.html).** We do not provide your credit card number to any outside parties. Your transaction is conducted on a secure server using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. Care2 does not store your credit card information on our servers. Soon after processing your Charter Member transaction, we delete your credit card number from our servers.

**How Does Care2 use my personal information?**

  1. **Personal and Demographic Information:** Care2 asks for personal information, such as your name, email address, and zip code. Your personal information is used to set up your Care2 account and to allow you to use many Care2 member services. Members may also supply additional information for special site services like Meet Members, Biorhythms, and Stock Portfolios. This information is only used for the specific site feature chosen by the user. Care2 also asks for demographic information, such as your education level, occupation and industry. Care2 does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 and if Care2 later learns that a child under 13 is registered, steps will be taken to remove the child's information from the data base. 

When you register to become a **[Care2 Charter Member](https://commerce1.care2.com/charter.html),** we require personal information (like name, mailing address, credit card number). We use this information to ship products to you and confirm the validity of your credit card. We do not sell this information to any third-party. We do provide your mailing address to a third-party provider of Care2 apparel (T-shirts, Sweatshirts, etc.) so that these items can be mailed to you. We do not provide your credit card number to any outside parties. 

Your transaction is conducted on a secure server using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 

We will not store your credit card information on our servers. Soon after processing your Charter Member transaction, we delete your credit card number from our servers. We retain your address information to ensure that users receive merchandise provided for various charter membership levels and in case we opt to send you additional gifts in the future. If we choose to user your mailing address information for promotional purposes, we would get explicit permission from users first. Without explicit permission, we will not use any addresses gathered through our store except for order processing. 

  2. **Advertising:** Care2's goal in collecting personal and demographic information is to provide our members with the most personalized web experience possible and our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing about you, Care2 can deliver more relevant content and advertisements (e.g. banner ads), and hence better service, to you. 

In delivering targeted advertisements, Care2 plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (e.g. females over 35). Care2 or one of our ad server partners takes and displays the ad to users meeting those criteria. In this process, only Care2 -- not the advertiser – can access individuals' account information. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve some of the ads when you visit our web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements on Care2.com, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information use by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp). 

Advertising revenues help keep Care2 services free, and provide revenues for donations for Wildlife Conservation. 

  3. **[Biorhythm Generator:](http://www.care2.com/biorhythms/)** The biorhythm generator is a Care2 feature that plots graph results of an individual's intellectual, physical and emotional biorhythm cycles based on the individual's birth date. To use the feature, users enter their birth date and the date for which they wish to view results. This information is only used for the Biorhythm feature. The graph results are intended to inform and entertain. Care2 does not share or disclose the birth date or graph information with any other party and is used only for immediate display for the person entering his/her information. 
  4. **[Care2 Café Discussions:](http://www.care2.com/community/cafe/)** To post messages to the Care2 Café discussion boards, users must be Care2 members and must log in. When posting a message, a member's Care2 username will appear hyperlinked as the "author" of each message. The username is required to ensure that every user who posts a message has a unique user id. The username is hyperlinked to allow other Care2 users to e-mail you; our system is designed to allow members to contact you via e-mail without revealing your e-mail address. When posting a message, there is an e-mail notification check off box that is automatically checked off so that you will be notified via e-mail when another user responds to your posted message. If you do not want to receive these e-mail notifications, simply uncheck the e-mail notification box before posting your message. After posting a message, a link to your member profile will appear (if you have submitted a member profile). Because, your member profile will be available for all members of the Care2 community, Do NOT include personal information. 
  5. **[Care2 Share:](http://www.care2.com/community/care_to_share.html)** When submitting information to the Care2 Share form, Care2 users must login and provide the information they want to submit along with their e-mail address. Care2 needs the user's e-mail address to contact users with questions about or acceptance of submissions and to provide the date when the submission will be featured on Care2. When featuring a user's Care2 Share submission, Care2 mentions the user's first name and will link to the user's member profile if he/she has submitted a profile. A member profile can only be viewed by Care2 members and can be hidden from view at anytime if a Care2 member adjusts his/her account profile found in the [My Care2 Page](http://www.care2.com/accounts/manageaccount.html) or on the [Submit Profile page](http://www.care2.com/members/add.html). 
  6. **[E-Cards:](http://www.care2.com/send/categories)** When sending e-cards, Care2 requires your email address and the name and email address of the intended e-card recipient. Care2 will not use the recipient's email address for any reason other than sending the greeting card notification intended by the sender. Care2's [Tell A Friend](http://www.care2.com/members/tellafriend.html) feature ensures the same privacy for recipients. 
  7. **E-Mail:** To provide Care2 members email service, Care2 relinquishes to its email provider, CommTouch, your first and last name, user name, Care2 email address, and an encrypted password that serves as a proxy for your actual password (Care2 does not relinquish your actual password).CommTouch does not use the user's information for any other purpose than to set up their free email account. 
  8. **[Events:](http://www.care2.com/events/index.html)** When submitting events to Care2's Green Event Calendar, Care2 asks members to provide the time, place, country and address of the event, an event description, a name of the event host, and a contact email address. Care2 requires this information to notify the Care2 member that his/her event has been posted to the site. Care2 also requires this information to determine whether a submitted event is environmentally relevant. If the event is not environmentally relevant, Care2 can email the individual who submitted the event asking for clarification. Additionally, by requiring a contact email address, other Care2 users can ontact this individual with questions concerning the event. 
  9. **[Green Lynx:](http://www.care2.com/cgi-bin/search/care2search.cgi)** Green Lynx is a database of links to environmentally related web sites. When submitting Green Lynx, Care2 ask users for a link's page title, site description, search words and an URL. Care2 also requires your email address so we can send you an email confirming that we have added your link to the Green Lynx database. 
  10. **[Member Profiles:](http://www.care2.com/members/index.html)** Member Profiles is a free optional service for Care2 members who wish to meet other members. When submitting a profile, you have the OPTION of submitting any or all of the following information: 
    * Name 
    * City, State, and Country of Residence 
    * Birthdate 
    * Gender 
    * Hobbies/Interests 
    * Occupation 
    * If you could be animal, what animal would you want to be? 
    * Homepage URL 
    * Email address 
    * Marital status 
    * Personal quote 
    * Photos 

Your profile is NOT displayed to others UNLESS you click the "submit" button on the personal profile registration page. If you submit your profile, other members with similar interests will be able to contact you. Our system is designed to allow members to contact you via email, without revealing your email address. Remember: Because, this information will be available for all members of the Care2 community, Do NOT include personal information. Users can hide their profiles from view at anytime by adjusting his/her account profile found in the [My Care2 Page](http://www.care2.com/accounts/manageaccount.html) or on the [Submit Profile page](http://www.care2.com/members/add.html). 

  11. **[Race for the Rain Forest](http://rainforest.care2.com/)** and **[Race for the Big Cats](http://bigcats.care2.com/)** : Members and visitors may participate in the Races without entering personal information. However, to track visits and see how one compares to other Race participants, users must join the Race. Care2 members are automatically enrolled in the Races and hence their Race user name and password is the same as their Care2 user name and password. New visitors become Race participants by creating logins and passwords and an e-mail address, which is used to send Race participants optional Race updates and customer service communications. 

When Race participants login to a Race, Care2 tracks the participant's site visits. Race participants can elect to invite friends to join the Races using a template provided by Care2. Through the template, one e-mail invitation containing a unique url link to the Race is sent to each person whose email is entered by the sender. Care2 has a no-SPAM policy and thus will not collect or sell the e-mail addresses entered by Race participants. All Race participants will also receive periodic Race updates via e-mail. These updates can be disabled using the "account settings" page on the Race web site. Through the unique url, members' friends' Race site visits are tracked and credited to the member using the unique url. Sending the url in personal e-mail or posting it in text or image-link format is entirely the member's option, although Care2 specifically asks members to avoid sending the unique url to anyone they do not know. Players' participation data is aggregated daily and the participation statistics of the top 100 Racers are posted hourly, listed by the member's chosen Care2 login. The posted information for the top 100 Racers includes the number of visits to the Race for the Rain Forest and Big Cats sites and the number of acres the individual has helped protect. 

  12. **[Stock Portfolio:](http://www.care2.com/financial/portfolio.html)** To set up a mock stock portfolio in Care2.com's [Green Money](http://www.care2.com/financial/) area, users must be Care2 members. To access their stock portfolio, users must login by using their Care2 username and password. Care2 does not share user login information with its financial content provider -- Stockpoint. Instead, when Care2 member's input their user name and password, Care2 generates a unique identifier that allows Stockpoint to display a Care2 member's stock portfolio when requested by the member without knowing any personal information about the member. The user can choose to supply the site with additional information to use some of the Stock Portfolio's additional features. This information will only be used for Stock Portfolios. 
  13. **[Tell A Friend:](http://www.care2.com/members/tellafriend.html)** To use Care2's Tell A Friend form, users must be Care2 members. To complete the form, a member must submit his/her own name and e-mail address along with a friend's e-mail address. The member selects the information that will be sent based upon Care2's pre-provided categories; the member may also include a personal message to be included with Care2's pre-provided information. The recipient's (friend's) e-mail address is necessary to send the combined Care2 and member message. The sender's (member's) name and e-mail information is necessary for Care2 to reveal the sender's identity to the intended recipient. Care2 has a no-SPAM policy and thus will not collect or sell the e-mail addresses entered by members using the Tell A Friend form.

**Will Care2 disclose any of my personal information?**

Care2 will only disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights or property of Care2. Care2 will also disclose personal information in some limited circumstances (e.g., when you request an opt-in newsletter or sign-up for e-centives), but this is specifically described to you when we collect the information, such as in a Terms of Service agreement. If you choose to sign up for an e-centives account, we will send e-centives your name, zip code, email address, gender, and age. E-centives uses this information to offer you targeted coupons and savings. E-centives states that they will not sell or distribute this information; however, Care2 cannot guarantee to the user that e-centives will abide by their [privacy policy](http://www.e-centives.com/servlet/product/ehtml/privacy). Under confidentiality agreements, Care2 may match user information with third-party data but will never allow such information to be personally identifiable to outside parties. Also, Care2 does disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, X% of our users are female) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 

* * *

**How do I change my personal information?**

To make changes to your name, password and email address, simply log in to your account and click on the "[Account](https://web.archive.org/accounts/manageaccount.html)" icon. Select the appropriate function(s) to make your desired change(s). For other changes to your account, please send an email to support@earth.care2.com. 

* * *

**What is "Heightened Security"?**

The "[heightened security](https://web.archive.org/accounts/ac-security.html)" option is an account management tool that allows you to set privacy controls. If enabled, heightened security ensures that no one can search for your login information and view it online. 

* * *

**Will Care2 use my information for direct mailings?**

No, unless you request them. Currently, Care2 offers several direct mailing describing our site progress, new features and announcements. If you do not want to receive these occasional mailings, simply opt out of them when registering to become a member. If you elect to receive the newsletter but later change your mind, go to the My Care2 page and change your preferences by unsubscribing to the newsletter. Care2 also offers several opt-in mailings including one from each of our partner nonprofit organizations and several newsletters from a commercial entity. If you elect to receive any of these opt-in newsletters, some personal information including your name and email address will be sent to the respective nonprofit or commercial entitty delivering the newsletter. The user should beware that by opting-in to either the nonprofit or commercial newsletter offerings, Care2 will no longer be able to track and control the user information sent out. 

* * *

**

Does Care2 use cookies?

**

Yes, [cookies](http://www.zdwebopedia.com/cookie.htm) are used on Care2 in two ways. 

(1) We use cookies to be reminded of whom you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) to deliver a better and more personalized service to you. 

(2) Advertising networks serving ads onto Care2 may also use cookies. Care2 has no control over information collected by advertising networks nor can we access this information. 

If you elect to disable cookies on your hard drive, you may be unable to use certain Care2 site features that require your user name, such as accessing your email account, submitting events and Green Lynx, viewing member profiles, and changing your user preferences. 

* * *

**

Does Care2 sell e-mail addresses to advertisers?

**

Not without your direct permission. We respect your privacy and despise [SPAM](http://www.zdwebopedia.com/spam.htm). 

As mentioned above, in some cases you may opt-in to nonprofit partner newsletters, e-centives, or commercial newsletters. In these cases and at your request, we will send your email address to a third party. Depending on the newsletter, this may result in a fee paid to Care2 in exchange for a new customer. 

With regards to e-mail communication with us, we read every message sent to us and do our best to respond quickly. We do save messages that might be needed if the sender contacts us again, but we absolutely do not sell or rent e-mail addresses to other companies. 

* * *

****

**Why does my IP address show on the cards I send?**

The reason we include your IP address* is because Care2 is not intended as an anonymous e-mail / card service. Such systems are open to abuse, and including the IP is one step we take to discourage such inappropriate behavior. Additionally, all sends and pickups, including IP numbers, dates and times are recorded and stored. It's unfortunate this is needed, but the bottom line is that we require our customers to respect the privacy and rights of other members of the web community and we act to uphold this standard. 

There really is not much of a privacy concern by displaying the IP on your card. First, your IP is included with every e-mail you've ever sent. Second, most people's IP addresses are dynamic - meaning they change each time you click on something, so anyone tracking down an IP number would need to know the exact time the IP address was captured. Third, it would cost so much, and would require so much legal work to get the Internet Service Providers to release the customer name, that it is basically worthless to anyone but law enforcement officials. 

If you have any additional questions or concerns, feel free to contact us at support@earth.care2.com. 

* Your "IP Address" is the numeric address of the server (Internet computer) to which you connected to access the Internet. For a more complete definition, [click here](http://www.zdwebopedia.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html).

**

What else should I know about my privacy?

** Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Furthermore, while we strive to protect your personal information, Care2 cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet, and you do so at your own risk. In addition, Care2 partners and third-party Internet sites and services accessible through Care2 have separate, independent privacy and data collection practices. Care2 has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions. The point? You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. 

Also, Care2 uses reputable third parties to serve some of the advertisements that you see on the pages of Care2. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please [click here.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp)

* * *

****

**What happens if changes are made to the privacy policy?**

Care2 reserves the right to change the privacy policy but will notify users of such changes through email and/or by posting a notice on the site. If the change involves the use of a user's personally identifiable information then the notice to users will contain directions on how users can opt-out of the change.
