## Answers to Privacy Questions

### Does Care2 ask for personal information?

Yes. Care2 asks for your name and other personal information when you sign up for our services.

### How Does Care2 use my personal information?

#### Personal and Demographic Information:

Care2 asks for personal information, such as your name, email address, date of birth, street address and zip code. Your personal information is used to set up your Care2 account and to allow you to use many Care2 member services. Members may also supply additional information for special site services such as My Care2. Care2 may also ask for demographic information, such as your education level, occupation and industry. Care2 does not knowingly collect information from children under 13; if Care2 later learns that a child under 13 is registered, steps will be taken to remove the child's information from the database. We also reserve the right to collect publicly available data about you, either obtained directly by us or through a 3rd party.

#### Advertising:

Care2's goal in collecting personal and demographic information is to provide our members with the most personalized web experience possible and to provide our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing about you, Care2 can deliver more relevant content and advertisements (e.g. banner ads), and hence better service, to you. In delivering targeted online advertisements, Care2 plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (e.g. females over 35). Care2 or one of our ad server partners takes and displays the ad to users meeting those criteria. In this process, only Care2 — not the advertiser — can access individuals' account information.

We employ a third party service provider to display advertising on our Web site. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You would continue to receive generic ads.

**Advertising revenues help keep Care2 services free, and provide revenues for donations for wildlife conservation and other charities.**

#### [ThePetitionSite:](http://www.thepetitionsite.com/)

Care2 owns and maintains the nonpartisan petition tool, [ThePetitionSite.com](http://www.thepetitionsite.com/). Petition and Public Comment signers are required to provide certain personal information such as name, email address and often street address. This information is required to validate the petition signature / public comment. Care2 uses cookies and a signature database to provide data integrity and ease of use.

For petitions and surveys you've signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, country and comments as public information. For example, we may provide compilations of petitions, with your comments, to the President and legislators, other targets, or to the press. Unless you have requested to be included as "anonymous," this information will also be visible on the website. We will not make your street address publicly available, but we may transmit it to members of Congress, to other public officials, or to other targets as part of a petition to validate your signature. We may also make your comments, along with your first name, city, state and country, available to the press and public online.

Care2 hosts two kinds of petitions: free petitions sponsored by individuals and paid petitions sponsored by third parties, typically nonprofits or charities.

For the free petitions, only the public information listed above is made available to the petition sponsors or targets.

For many of the petitions sponsored by nonprofits, we provide an advocacy service allowing individuals to send individual e-mails to public officials, legislators, and other targets as well as public comments to government agencies, through our website. These messages are sent in your name, with your e-mail address as the return address and your full name and contact information is provided as part of the submission. These messages will only be sent out under your name as you approve them on an individual basis by signing an action. You are solely responsible for the specific message(s) you send using our email tool. Optional comments will be included in the body of the email message delivered to the petition target.

During the signing process, you may opt to receive certain newsletters and memberships, in which case Care2 will send your contact information to those third-party providers. However, unless you specifically opt to receive such offers or send your contact information to third parties during the signing process, Care2 will keep your email address information confidential. Note that for many campaigns, the default settings assume that you want to receive communications from the petition sponsor. If you do not wish to receive such communications, please uncheck the box next to the signup offer. Please note that when you join a third party we may use your petition activity to personalize the actions you see on the site and that we send to you by email.

#### [Care2 Group Forums:](http://www.care2.com/c2c/groups/)

To post messages to the Care2 discussion boards, users must be Care2 members and must log in. When posting a message, a member's Care2 name and/or user name will appear hyperlinked as the "author" of each message. Login is required to ensure that every user who posts a message has a unique user id. The name is hyperlinked to allow other Care2 users to e-mail you; our system is designed to allow members to contact you via e-mail without revealing your e-mail address. When posting a message, there is an e-mail notification check off box that is automatically checked off so that you will be notified via e-mail when another user responds to your posted message. If you do not want to receive these e-mail notifications, simply uncheck the e-mail notification box before posting your message. After posting a message, a link to your member profile will appear (if you have submitted a member profile). Because your discussion postings and member profile will be publicly available, you should not post personal information. To request removal of your personal information from our discussion boards, contact us using our [Help Form](http://www.care2.com/help/support). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

#### [E-Cards:](http://www.care2.com/ecards/)

When sending e-cards, you must provide your email address and the name and email address of the intended e-card recipient. We will use this information only for the purpose of delivering the ecard notification to the recipient. Care2 retains ecard recipients' contact information only as long as necessary to ensure that the ecard is retrieved by the recipient. Care2 has a no-SPAM policy and thus will not share or sell the e-mail addresses entered by card senders.

#### [Newsletters:](http://www.care2.com/newsletters)

Care2 offers a variety of newsletters. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the "unsubscribe" instructions included in each newsletter, or by going to your [My Subscriptions](http://www.care2.com/newsletters) page and/or [Notifications](http://www.care2.com/c2c/my/edit_notifications.html) page to change your subscription preferences.

#### [Care2 Connect:](http://www.care2.com/passport/login.html?promoID=1&pg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.care2.com%2Fc2c%2Fmy%2F)

Care2 Connect (C2C) is an optional part of Care2 that facilitates new connections between members. C2C is accessible only among Care2 members who have personal profiles. Your personal contact information such as your email address and street address will be kept hidden from the public, and made visible only to you and individuals you have indicated are your friends. The C2C directory helps members locate their friends, and potential friends, by displaying first name, last name, city and other information on search results — but it does not include contact information per the aforementioned limitations. Contact can be initiated for "non-friends" by using an anonymous messaging system that will not reveal either party's address. If you wish to request removal of your information from our directory, you can contact us using our Help Form.

When submitting a profile, you have the option of including information such as: your name, city, state, and country of residence, birthdate, gender, hobbies, interests, expertises, occupation, business, homepage url, email address, marital status, marital status, personal quote, photos, etc. Remember: Because much of this information will be publicly available, do NOT include confidential information. Your personal friends network will be populated based on known relationships you have with other C2C members, as established through use of communications services on the Care2 system and as you specifically indicate while using C2C. Your friends network will be visible to other C2C users, and the privacy of each person is protected as described herein.

#### Tell-a-Friend service:

Care2 Connect members can elect to invite friends to join using an invitation template provided by Care2. Through the template, one e-mail invitation containing a unique url link is sent to each person whose email is entered by the sender. Care2 has a no-SPAM policy and thus will not collect or sell the e-mail addresses entered by Care2 members. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Care2 stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us using our Help Form to request that we remove this information from our database.

Members can remove themselves from the C2C system at any time by adjusting their account settings via their My Settings Page. Some changes may take up to 24 hours to appear on the site.

#### [Click-to-Donate](http://www.care2.com/click-to-donate/):

Members and visitors may participate in the "click-to-donate" features without entering personal information. However, to track visits and see how one compares to other participants, members must be logged in while visiting the site. Care2 members are automatically registered for each of the click-to-donate "Races" the first time they click on the free donation button while logged-in. New visitors can become Race participants after registering for a Care2 account.

Care2 tracks participants' site visits. Participants can elect to invite friends to join, using an invitation template provided by Care2. Through the template, one e-mail invitation is sent to each person whose email is entered by the sender. Care2 has a no-SPAM policy and thus will not share or sell the e-mail addresses entered by participants. Players' participation data is aggregated daily and the participation statistics of the top 100 Racers are posted more frequently on each race.

#### Distributed Services:

Care2 provides 3rd party affiliates access via service modules to certain content and services on the Care2 site. These modules may include discussion boards, user submitted content and other services. The modules may be embedded to appear as if they are part of the 3rd party websites, though the modules themselves are hosted on Care2 servers. All feeds and service modules are subject to our Affiliate Terms of Service. The goal for these distribution services is to expand Care2's network reach to engage more like-minded individuals.

#### RSS Feeds:

Care2 makes some content available as RSS feeds. Content available for syndication is usually denoted with an XML or RSS button. All content syndicated is subject to our Terms of Service. No modifications may be made to any of the materials syndicated. No individual, organization or company may license, sell or otherwise assign use of Care2 RSS content. RSS distribution services help Care2 and its members reach and engage more like-minded individuals.

#### Facebook Connect:

You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.

#### Links to 3rd Party Sites:

Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Care2.com. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit.

### Should I post personal information in group forums?

Users should always be aware that any personally identifiable information submitted to Care2.com can be read, collected, and used by other users of the Care2 site, and could be used to send unsolicited messages to the submitter. Care2 is not responsible for personally identifiable information which users choose to submit. Care2 specifically advises users not to provide information which they regard as sensitive, such as email addresses, passwords, phone numbers, mailing addresses, or financial information.

### Will Care2 disclose any of my personal information?

Care2 will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. Care2 will only disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, or to protect the rights or property of Care2, or as necessary to provide personalized Care2 member services. If Care2 is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. Care2 may also disclose your personal information, including name and contact information in some limited circumstances such as when you specifically opt to receive a 3rd party newsletter. We may also provide information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Care2 under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to communicate with you about offers from Care2 and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information or use for any other purposes other than to provide these services to us. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us through our [Help Request Form](http://www.care2.com/help/support). Under confidentiality agreements, Care2 may also match user information with third-party data. Also, Care2 does disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, _X% of our users are female_ ) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

### How do I change or delete my personal information?

To make changes to your name, password, address, subscriptions and other account information, simply [visit the My Settings page](http://www.care2.com/accounts/index.html). Select the appropriate function(s) there to make your desired change(s). For other changes, or to request deletion of your information, please contact us using our [Help Request Form](http://www.care2.com/help/support). We will respond to your request within a reasonable time.

### Will Care2 use my information for direct e-mailings?

Care2 offers a variety of direct e-mail subscriptions describing our petition success stories, new site features, healthy living tips, activist alerts, and announcements, including commercial and non-commercial offers. If you do not want to receive any of our optional mailings, simply opt out of them when registering to become a member or during other subscription opportunities.

If you sign a petition on [ThePetitionSite.com](http://www.thepetitionsite.com/), you will automatically receive emailed news updates about the petition and other important causes.

If you elect to receive any of our newsletters but later change your mind, go to your [My Settings](http://www.care2.com/accounts/) page; from there you can edit both your "Subscriptions" and your "Notifications." Our emailed newsletters and notifications contain an "unsubscribe" link to allow you to easily remove your address from that mail stream.

Regardless of the above, Care2 may send occasional emailed messages, such as critical service announcements or other correspondence, to all registered members. To stop all such announcements, you must delete your account. You may do so by following [this link](http://www.care2.com/passport/login.html?promoID=1&pg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.care2.com%2Faccounts%2Fdelete_this_account.html).

Care2 also offers optional mailings from our partner nonprofit organizations and from commercial entities. If you elect to receive any of these newsletters, some personal information, including your name and email address, will be sent to the respective nonprofit or commercial entity delivering the newsletter. In these cases, Care2 would no longer be able to track and control the user information. The user would be able to contact the newsletter publishers in order to control subscription preferences.

### Does Care2 use cookies and other Tracking Technologies?

Yes, cookies and other tracking technologies are used on Care2 in several ways.

  1. As is true of most web sites, Care2.com gathers certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do link this automatically collected data to other information collected about site visitors.
  2. We use cookies to be reminded of whom you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) to deliver a better and more personalized service to you. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you elect to disable cookies on web browser, you may be unable to use certain Care2 site features that require membership, such as changing your subscriptions, notifications, and other preferences.
  3. Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Care2 and our advertising partners, affiliates, and analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
  4. We use "local storage" in users' web browsers to store user preferences and to personalize the user's site visit. Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use local storage and/or LSO (Local Shared Objects) and/or "Flash cookies" to store information. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies [click here](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlayer/LSM/WS6aa5ec234ff3f285139dc56112e3786b68c-7fff.html).



Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 "local storage" data. For more information on this topic, you could do a web search for "remove local storage data."

We, or a data provider we have engaged, may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads, content or services. No personally identifiable information is placed into these cookies. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of these cookies or learn more please go to [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

### Does Care2 sell e-mail addresses to advertisers?

We would only provide user email addresses to nonprofit or advertising partners with the user's direct permission. We respect your privacy and despise spam.

As mentioned above, in some cases you may opt to receive nonprofit partner newsletters or other commercial offers. When you opt to receive such an offer via Care2, we will send your email address and other necessary contact information to the newsletter publisher. Depending on the newsletter, this may result in a fee paid to Care2 in exchange for a new customer. Care2 will never offer newsletter subscriptions from, or reveal your address information to, organizations known to be spammers, casinos, or adult-content providers.

Why then do some people receive spam at an account they have only used on Care2? In many cases, spammers create a "dictionary attack" by combining common names and initials to create a list of email addresses that might or might not work. In many cases, Care2 members send email from a Care2 account's email address to a friend or family member whose computer gets a virus or whose email account is hacked, resulting in private email addresses being revealed to the spammer. In other cases, two people have similar addresses, perhaps differing by only 1-2 characters, and one user makes a typographic mistake that results in the other user's address. The bottom line is that if you receive spam, we had nothing to do with it. We despise spam, and we would never associate ourselves with spammers.

With regards to e-mail communication with us, we read every message sent to us and do our best to respond quickly. We do save messages that might be needed if the sender contacts us again, but we absolutely do not sell, rent, give, or share e-mail addresses to other companies, unless you have specifically opted to receive such communications.

### How does Care2 secure your information and its data storage?

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Care2's servers are located at a world-class co-location facility in California, USA. The facility has some of the most powerful physical security systems in the business, from advanced smoke detection and fire suppression systems to 24/7 secured access with motion sensors, video camera surveillance, and security breach alarms. Only qualified Care2 engineers are given access to the building.

Access to the database is restricted. All servers are protected by a firewall and secure data lines. Server access is restricted to qualified Care2 employees, on an as-needed basis to maintain the operation of the website.

Although we maintain strict policies and procedures to safeguard our servers and our customers' data, it is not possible to guarantee security due to the inherent risks of transmitting data over the Internet. 

### What is Care2's data retention policy?

Our data retention policy varies depending on the business and system needs, but remains in harmony with the other policies stated here. Our business systems and databases are securely stored and archived for disaster recovery purposes.

### What else should I know about my privacy?

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online — for example on message boards, through e-mail, Care2 Groups, or in chat areas — that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Furthermore, while we strive to protect your personal information, Care2 cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet, and you do so at your own risk. In addition, Care2 partners and third-party Internet sites and services accessible through Care2 have separate, independent privacy and data collection practices. Care2 has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions. The point? You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.

Also, Care2 uses reputable third parties to serve some of the advertisements that you see on the pages of Care2. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest to you.

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook "Like" button, and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, the URL of the page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

### What happens if changes are made to the privacy policy?

Care2 reserves the right to change the privacy policy, but will notify users of such changes through email and/or by posting a notice on the site. In the event of any material change, this notification will be prior to that change becoming effective. If the change involves the use of a user's personally identifiable information then the notice to users will contain directions on how users can opt-out of the change.
