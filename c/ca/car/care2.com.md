** Answers **

** Does Care2 ask for personal information?  **

Yes. Care2 asks for your name and other personal information when you sign up for our services. 

** Does Care2 ask for credit card information? When?  **

Care2 allows you to use your credit card to become a **[ Care2 Charter Member ](https://commerce1.care2.com/charter.html) . ** We do not provide your credit card number to any outside parties. Your transaction is conducted on a secure server using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. Care2 does not store your credit card information on our servers. Soon after processing your Charter Member transaction, we delete your credit card number from our servers.

** **

**How Does Care2 use my personal information?**

  1. **Personal and Demographic Information:** Care2 asks for personal information, such as your name, email address, street address and zip code. Your personal information is used to set up your Care2 account and to allow you to use many Care2 member services. Members may also supply additional information for special site services such as Meet Members, Biorhythms, Petitions and Stock Portfolios. Care2 may also ask for demographic information, such as your education level, occupation and industry. Care2 does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 and if Care2 later learns that a child under 13 is registered, steps will be taken to remove the child's information from the data base. 

When you register to become a **[ Care2 Charter Member ](https://commerce1.care2.com/charter.html) , ** we require personal information (such as name, mailing address, credit card number). We use this information to ship products to you and confirm the validity of your credit card. We do not sell this information to any third-party. We do provide your mailing address to a third-party provider of Care2 apparel (T-shirts, Sweatshirts, etc.) so that these items can be mailed to you. We do not provide your credit card number to any outside parties. 

Your ecommerce and Charter Member transactions are conducted on a secure server using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 

We will not store your credit card information on our servers. Soon after processing your Charter Member transaction, we delete your credit card number from our servers. We retain your address information to ensure that users receive merchandise provided for various charter membership levels and in case we opt to send you additional gifts in the future. Without explicit permission, we will not use any addresses gathered through our Charter Member store except for order processing. 

  2. **Advertising:** Care2's goal in collecting personal and demographic information is to provide our members with the most personalized web experience possible and our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing about you, Care2 can deliver more relevant content and advertisements (e.g. banner ads), and hence better service, to you. 

In delivering targeted online advertisements, Care2 plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (e.g. females over 35). Care2 or one of our ad server partners takes and displays the ad to users meeting those criteria. In this process, only Care2 -- not the advertiser can access individuals' account information. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve some of the ads when you visit our web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements on Care2.com, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information use by these companies, [ click here](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/c/cookie.html). Advertisers may also use "clear gifs" to track advertising page views, but this information is not connected to personal information collected by Care2. 

Advertising revenues help keep Care2 services free, and provide revenues for donations for Wildlife Conservation. 

  3. **[ Biorhythm Generator: ](http://www.care2.com/biorhythms/) ** The biorhythm generator is a Care2 feature that plots graph results of an individual's intellectual, physical and emotional biorhythm cycles based on the individual's birth date. To use the feature, users enter their birth date and the date for which they wish to view results. This information is only used for the Biorhythm feature. The graph results are intended to inform and entertain. Care2 does not share or disclose the birth date or graph information with any other party and is used only for immediate display for the person entering his/her information. 
  4. **[ Care2 Café Discussions: ](http://www.care2.com/community/cafe/) ** To post messages to the Care2 Café discussion boards, users must be Care2 members and must log in. When posting a message, a member's Care2 username will appear hyperlinked as the "author" of each message. The username is required to ensure that every user who posts a message has a unique user id. The username is hyperlinked to allow other Care2 users to e-mail you; our system is designed to allow members to contact you via e-mail without revealing your e-mail address. When posting a message, there is an e-mail notification check off box that is automatically checked off so that you will be notified via e-mail when another user responds to your posted message. If you do not want to receive these e-mail notifications, simply uncheck the e-mail notification box before posting your message. After posting a message, a link to your member profile will appear (if you have submitted a member profile). Because, your discussion postings and member profile will be publicly available, Do NOT include personal information. 
  5. **[ PetitionSite: ](http://www.petitionsite.com/) ** Care2 owns and maintains the nonpartisan PetitionSite.com. Petition and Public Comment signers are required to provide certain personal information such as name, email address and often street address. This information is required to validate the petition / public comment. Care2 uses cookies and a signature database to provide data integrity and ease of use. Your email address, street address, phone number and other specific contact information will not be available to either the petition creator or petition recipient, unless specifically stated during the petition signing process. During the signing process, you may opt to receive certain email newsletters and online memberships, in which case Care2 will send required contact information to those 3rd party providers. However, unless you specifically opt to receive such online offers or send your contact information to 3rd parties during the signing process, Care2 will keep your email address information confidential. 
  6. **[ E-Cards: ](http://www.care2.com/send/categories) ** When sending e-cards, Care2 requires your email address and the name and email address of the intended e-card recipient. Care2 will not use the recipient's email address for any reason other than sending the greeting card notification intended by the sender. 
  7. **E-Mail:** To provide Care2 members email service, Care2 relinquishes to its email provider, MailCentro, your first and last name, user name, Care2 email address, and an encrypted password that serves as a proxy for your actual password (Care2 does not relinquish your actual password, except on rare occasion as required to provide customer support to an individual). MailCentro does not use the user's information for any other purpose than to set up and maintain their free email account. 
  8. **Newsletters** Care2 offers a variety of Care2 and 3rd party newsletters. If you opt to receive one or more newsletters via a check box or by clicking on a specially marked subscribe link, Care2 will send the required contact information to those 3rd party providers. 
  9. **[ Member Profiles: ](http://www.care2.com/members/index.html) ** Member Profiles is a free optional service for Care2 members who wish to meet other members. When submitting a profile, you have the OPTION of submitting any or all of the following information: 
    * Name 
    * City, State, and Country of Residence 
    * Birthdate 
    * Gender 
    * Hobbies/Interests 
    * Occupation 
    * If you could be animal, what animal would you want to be? 
    * Homepage URL 
    * Email address 
    * Marital status 
    * Personal quote 
    * Photos 

Your profile is NOT displayed to others UNLESS you click the "submit" button on the personal profile registration page. If you submit your profile, other members with similar interests will be able to contact you. Our system is designed to allow members to contact you via email, without revealing your email address. Remember: Because, this information will be publically available, Do NOT include personal information. Users can hide their profiles from view at anytime by adjusting his/her account profile found in the [My Care2 Page](http://www.care2.com/accounts/manageaccount.html) or on the [Submit Profile page](http://www.care2.com/members/add.html). 

  10. **[ Race for the Rain Forest ](http://rainforest.care2.com/) ** , **[ Race for the Big Cats ](http://bigcats.care2.com/) ** , **[ Race for the Oceans ](http://oceans.care2.com/) ** and **[ End Breast Cancer ](http://cancer.care2.com/) ** : Members and visitors may participate in the Races without entering personal information. However, to track visits and see how one compares to other Race participants, users must join the Race. Care2 members are automatically enrolled in the Races and hence their Race user name and password is the same as their Care2 user name and password. New visitors become Race participants by creating logins and passwords and an e-mail address, which is used to send Race participants optional Race updates and customer service communications. 

When Race participants login to a Race, Care2 tracks the participant's site visits. Race participants can elect to invite friends to join the Races using a template provided by Care2. Through the template, one e-mail invitation containing a unique url link to the Race is sent to each person whose email is entered by the sender. Care2 has a no-SPAM policy and thus will not collect or sell the e-mail addresses entered by Race participants. All Race participants will also receive periodic Race updates via e-mail. These updates can be disabled using the "account settings" page on the Race web site. Through the unique url, members' friends' Race site visits are tracked and credited to the member using the unique url. Sending the url in personal e-mail or posting it in text or image-link format is entirely the member's option, although Care2 specifically asks members to avoid sending the unique url to anyone they do not know. Players' participation data is aggregated daily and the participation statistics of the top 100 Racers are posted hourly, listed by the member's chosen Care2 login. The posted information for the top 100 Racers includes the number of visits to the Race for the Rain Forest and Big Cats sites and the number of acres the individual has helped protect. 

  11. **[ Stock Portfolio: ](http://www.care2.com/financial/portfolio.html) ** To set up a mock stock portfolio in Care2.com's [ Green Money ](http://www.care2.com/financial/) area, users must be Care2 members. To access their stock portfolio, users must login by using their Care2 username and password. Care2 does not share user login information with its financial content provider -- Stockpoint. Instead, when Care2 member's input their user name and password, Care2 generates a unique identifier that allows Stockpoint to display a Care2 member's stock portfolio when requested by the member without knowing any personal information about the member. The user can choose to supply the site with additional information to use some of the Stock Portfolio's additional features. This information will only be used for Stock Portfolios.

** **

**Will Care2 disclose any of my personal information?**

Care2 will only disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights or property of Care2. Care2 may also disclose your email address in some limited circumstances (e.g., when you request an opt-in newsletter or sign-up for e-centives), but this is specifically described to you when we collect the information. If you choose to sign up for an e-centives account, we will send e-centives your name, zip code, email address, gender, and age. E-centives uses this information to offer you targeted coupons and savings. E-centives states that they will not sell or distribute this information; however, Care2 cannot guarantee to the user that e-centives will abide by their [privacy policy](http://www.e-centives.com/servlet/ecentives/ehtml/privacyPage). We may also provide information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Care2 under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to communicate with you about offers from Care2 and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. Under confidentiality agreements, Care2 may also match user information with third-party data. Also, Care2 does disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, X% of our users are female) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

**How do I change my personal information?**

To make changes to your name, password and email address, simply log in to your account and click on the " [ MyCare2](https://web.archive.org/accounts/manageaccount.html) " link. Select the appropriate function(s) to make your desired change(s). For other changes to your account, please send an email to support@earth.care2.com. 

* * *

**What is "Heightened Security"?**

The "[ heightened security](https://web.archive.org/accounts/ac-security.html)" option is an account management tool that allows you to set privacy controls. If enabled, heightened security ensures that no one can search for your login information and view it online. 

* * *

**Will Care2 use my information for direct e-mailings?**

No, unless you request them. Currently, Care2 offers several direct e-mail subscriptions describing our site progress, new features, news and announcements. If you do not want to receive these occasional mailings, simply opt out of them when registering to become a member. If you elect to receive a newsletter but later change your mind, go to your MyCare2 page and change your preferences by unsubscribing to the newsletter. Each emailing will also contain unsubscription information in the email footer. Regardless of the above, Care2 may send occasional important updates regarding a member's account, critical service announcements, etc. It is anticipated that such mailings will occur only one or two times per year. Care2 also offers several opt-in mailings from our partner nonprofit organizations and several newsletters from commercial entities. If you elect to receive any of these newsletters, some personal information including your name and email address will be sent to the respective nonprofit or commercial entity delivering the newsletter. The user should beware that by opting-in to either the nonprofit or commercial newsletter offerings, Care2 will no longer be able to track and control the user information sent out. 

* * *

**

Does Care2 use cookies? 

**

Yes, [ cookies](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/c/cookie.html) are used on Care2 in two ways. 

(1) We use cookies to be reminded of whom you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) to deliver a better and more personalized service to you. 

(2) Advertising networks serving ads onto Care2 may also use cookies. Care2 has no control over information collected by advertising networks nor can we access this information. 

If you elect to disable cookies on your hard drive, you may be unable to use certain Care2 site features that require your user name, such as accessing your email account, viewing member profiles, and changing your user preferences. 

* * *

**

What tracking technologies does Care2 use? 

**

In addition to cookies (see above), Care2 tracks information via database records and "clear gifs" that allow Care2 to know if a web page has been viewed. 

If you elect to disable cookies on your hard drive, this will also disable database tracking of personalized statistics such as click-to-donate race clicks, and you may be unable to use certain Care2 site features that require your user name, such as accessing your email account, viewing member profiles, and changing your user preferences. 

* * *

**

Does Care2 sell e-mail addresses to advertisers? 

**

Not without your direct permission. We respect your privacy and despise [ SPAM](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/s/spam.html) . 

As mentioned above, in some cases you may opt to receive nonprofit partner newsletters, e-centives, or commercial newsletters. When you opt to receive a newsletter via Care2, we will send your email address and necessary demographic information to the newsletter publisher. Depending on the newsletter, this may result in a fee paid to Care2 in exchange for a new customer. Care2 will never offer newsletter subscriptions from, or reveal your personal information to, organizations known to be spammers, casinos, or adult-content providers. 

With regards to e-mail communication with us, we read every message sent to us and do our best to respond quickly. We do save messages that might be needed if the sender contacts us again, but we absolutely do not sell or rent e-mail addresses to other companies, unless you have specifically opted to receive such communications. 

* * *

** **

**Why does my IP address show on the cards I send?**

The reason we include your IP address* is because Care2 is not intended as an anonymous e-mail / card service. Such systems are open to abuse, and including the IP is one step we take to discourage such inappropriate behavior. Additionally, all sends and pickups, including IP numbers, dates and times are recorded and stored. It's unfortunate this is needed, but the bottom line is that we require our customers to respect the privacy and rights of other members of the web community and we act to uphold this standard. 

There really is not much of a privacy concern by displaying the IP on your card. First, your IP is included with every e-mail you've ever sent. Second, most people's IP addresses are dynamic - meaning they change each time you click on something, so anyone tracking down an IP number would need to know the exact time the IP address was captured. Third, it would cost so much, and would require so much legal work to get the Internet Service Providers to release the customer name, that it is basically worthless to anyone but law enforcement officials. 

If you have any additional questions or concerns, feel free to contact us at support@earth.care2.com. 

* Your "IP Address" is the numeric address of the server (Internet computer) to which you connected to access the Internet. For a more complete definition, [ click here](http://www.zdwebopedia.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html) .

How does Care2 secure its data storage? 

** Care2's servers are located at a world-class co-location facility in California, USA. The facility has some of the most powerful physical security systems in the business, from advanced smoke detection and fire suppression systems to 24/7 secured access with motion sensors, video camera surveillance, and security breach alarms. Only certain Care2 employees are given access to the building. Access to the database is protected by a firewall and secure data lines and available only to certain Care2 employees on an as-necessary basis. 

* * *

**What are the privacy standards for the Green Thumbs-Up and the TopMoxie software used to run it?**

Care2 has partnered with TopMoxie to provide you with the Green Thumbs-Up. TopMoxie is the only browser companion that places complete control of privacy issues in the hands of the consumer. The service does not collect any personally identifiable information from users and therefore ensures privacy protection and end-user anonymity.

Once you download the Green Thumbs-Up, you will receive customized offers to support your cause while you shop online. TopMoxie performs partner-defined tasks based on your web activity and preferences. We do not collect any personally identifiable information. The information in the Green Thumbs-Up is encrypted and stored on your computer, so it is protected and in your possession.

Since the Green Thumbs-Up includes both a client (software) and server (network) component, Green Thumbs-Up does communicate with your computer on a regular basis. Green Thumbs-Up retrieves various offers for you from our server and stores them on your computer so that they are ready for you when you visit a web site where that offer would be appropriate. In addition, Green Thumbs-Up self-updates to ensure system compatibility. 

The only data TopMoxie transfers from your computer to their servers is a log of the Green Thumbs-Up product performance which they analyze in aggregate to enhance the service. TopMoxie may also share aggregate data with Care2. There is nothing in TopMoxie service, data collection or business analysis that relates to you as an individual. 

And the limited data TopMoxie does store on their servers is physically locked up and protected by a firewall for safety. 

In the future, we may offer additional TopMoxie services. In each such case, you will need to proactively opt-in to the additional services. Some of these services may require personal information. You will be notified at the time you opt-in to any such services that we are collecting new information. 

**Changes to our Privacy Policy and End User License Agreement**

As we add functionality to TopMoxie, we may make changes to our Privacy Policy and End User License Agreement. In some cases, you might be required to actively 'accept' the new Privacy Policy in order to continue using TopMoxie. We will also continue to prominently publish our corporate Privacy Policy on our Web site (www.topmoxie.com). If our Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not – without your permission -- use the information that we received from you in a manner that is materially inconsistent with the Privacy Policy that was in effect when the information was collected. 

**Use of Cookies**

The TopMoxie software does not place cookies (standard Internet technology wherein a small piece of data is stored by your browser on your computer) on your system. The TopMoxie Web site does use a session cookie. We compile standard Web log information such as user IP addresses, browser type, browser versions, and operating system versions to understand market demand. We do not combine our Web log analysis with data stored on your PC in any way. 

* * *

**What else should I know about my privacy?** Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Furthermore, while we strive to protect your personal information, Care2 cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet, and you do so at your own risk. In addition, Care2 partners and third-party Internet sites and services accessible through Care2 have separate, independent privacy and data collection practices. Care2 has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions. The point? You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. 

Also, Care2 uses reputable third parties to serve some of the advertisements that you see on the pages of Care2. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please [ click here.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp)

* * *

** **

**What happens if changes are made to the privacy policy?**

Care2 reserves the right to change the privacy policy but will notify users of such changes through email and/or by posting a notice on the site. If the change involves the use of a user's personally identifiable information then the notice to users will contain directions on how users can opt-out of the change.
