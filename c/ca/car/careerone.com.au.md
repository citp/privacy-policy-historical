## How Information is Used

Information you post in public areas of the site or placed in the searchable CV database will be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world. We strive to provide a safe, secure environment by attempting to limit access to our database to legitimate users, but cannot guarantee that unauthorised parties will not gain access. We also cannot control how authorised users store or transfer information downloaded from the database, so you should ensure that you do not post sensitive information to CareerOne.

Our services may include the display of personalised content and advertising. We may use your information to contact you about CareerOne site updates, conduct surveys, or informational and service-related communications, including important security updates. 

## Disclosure of Information to Others

These third parties may not use that information for any purpose other than assisting us in providing those products and services. 

If you have consented for us to do so, we may use your information to contact you about other products or services available from our affiliates.
