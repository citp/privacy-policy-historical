News Interactive Privacy Policy 

By using this Site, you agree to the Privacy Policy of News Interactive Pty Limited set out below. News Interactive reviews its Privacy Policy periodically and reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify or remove portions of this policy at any time. This page should be reviewed periodically so that you are updated on any changes. News Interactive welcomes your comments and feedback. Please send an email to feedback@news.com.au News Interactive recognises the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about visitors to our sites. 

Personal Information

Personally identifiable information about visitors to our sites is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. For example, we may need to collect such information to provide you with information or a product you requested, in connection with membership, contest entry forms or for billing purposes, or in connection with community postings such as chat and bulletin boards. 

Sometimes News Interactive engages in activities with business partners and sponsors with whom personal information is jointly collected or shared. In situations where your information will be shared, it is recommended that you also review the privacy policy of our business partner or sponsor. 

Use of Information

Personally identifiable information that visitors submit to our sites is used only for the purpose for which it is submitted unless we disclose other uses in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection. 

CareerOne Resume Details

With respect to the CareerOne site, all personal information requested by CareerOne is encrypted and cannot be viewed by anyone other than you. If you choose to post your resume on the CareerOne site, you have the option of three security levels to determine the amount of personal information revealed. 

Use by Third Parties and Public Information

News Interactive may use reputable third parties to manage activities available on our sites including, but not limited to, contests, statistical analysis or chats. These parties may have access to personally identifiable information submitted by visitors who participate in those activities. Similarly, we may contract with third parties to handle the fulfillment of subscriptions or requests for information you submit to our sites, such as sending you a newsletter. In most instances, News Interactive instructs these third parties to use personally identifiable information only for the specific purpose for which it is collected. 

Any information posted on bulletin boards and/or communicated in chat areas becomes public information. While News Interactive strives to protect and respect your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose in a chat room or bulletin board. 

Use of Aggregate Data

We may collect certain non-personal information to optimise our Web pages for your computer (i.e., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address and the domain name of your Internet service provider). We may use such non-personal information for internal purposes, including but not limited to improving the content of our sites. 

News Interactive may use personally identifiable information in aggregate form - not individual - to improve our sites and make them more responsive to the needs of our visitors. This statistical compilation and analysis of information may also be used by News Interactive or provided to others as a summary report for marketing, advertising or research purposes. An example of a summary report may be "20,000 people clicked on an advertiser's banner advertisement on the sports headline page of news.com.au on a particular date." 

Disclosure

Personal information may be disclosed in special situations where News Interactive has reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with News Interactive's rights, property, users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Also, News Interactive may reveal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 

Security

News Interactive strives to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personally identifiable information submitted to our sites, and periodically reviews and updates its security measures in light of current technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. Although News Interactive strives to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warranty the security of any information you may transmit to us or from our online products and services. Once we do receive your transmission, however, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. When credit card information is transmitted, industry standard encryption is used. 

Changing Personal Information and Discontinuing Membership

You may access and change personal information News Interactive has obtained from you at any time, for example, in relation to membership information. If at any time after submitting your personal information to our sites you would no longer like to receive information from us, simply follow the "unsubscribe" directions at the end of any email communication you receive. 

Cookies

Cookies are data that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies, which are an industry standard used by most Web sites, including those operated by News Interactive, can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site. They allow us to track usage patterns and to compile data that can help us improve our content and target advertising. If you do not want information collected through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the Cookie feature. But you should note that Cookies may be necessary to provide you with features such as merchandise transactions or registered services. 

Links to Third Party Ad Serving; Links to Third Party and Co-Branded Sites

News Interactive uses the services of third parties for the serving and/or targeting of advertisements. Some of these third parties collect non-personal information through the use of Cookies. More information on the privacy and third party serving of advertisements can be found at http://www.ni.com.au. News Interactive may establish relationships with reputable business partners that allow visitors to our Internet sites to link directly to sites operated by these partners. Some of these sites may be "co-branded" with a News Interactive logo; however, these sites may not be operated or maintained by News Interactive. These sites may collect personal information from you that may be shared with News Interactive. This Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information we obtain in this manner. News Interactive is not responsible for the content or practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our sites. These links are meant for the user's convenience only. Links to third party sites do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement or approval by News Interactive of the content, policies or practices of such third party sites.
