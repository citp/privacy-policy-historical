## Collected Data

### Cookie

Some data are automatically collected through cookies because of users’ actions on the website. For more information please check our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/info/cookie/)

#### Website Statistics – Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics to track the number of visits, the pages visited and other metrics, which allow us to analyze traffic and review aggregated statistics.

In order to make sure that no PII (Personal Identifiable Information) are collected by Google Analytics, we have enabled the **IP anonymization** and **disabled the “User ID” feature** that could track individual users.

#### Advertising

This website is supported by advertising, i.e. sponsored ads displayed in the form of graphic elements (banners) and/or textual ads.

We are running both ads by direct advertisers through the Google DoubleClick server, and other ads from the Google AdSense network.

To better ensure our users’ privacy protection, we have **disabled the interest-based ads** that rely on information related to the users’ personal preferences and/or previous navigation.

Our ads are purely contextual, which means that they depend exclusively on the topic of the various pages and on a limited set of information about the users – such as country of origin, language and or type of device. These are generic, anonymized data that cannot be considered as PII (personal identifiable information).

However for statistical purposes the data collected by Google Analytics could be linked with the data collected by Google AdSense and/or DoubleClick for Publishers, which could potentially enable the user’s identification

To know more about Google’s privacy policy, and how to disable the personal data tracking, please refer to the page <https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/partner-sites/>
