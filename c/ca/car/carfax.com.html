    submit a request for information on any CARFAX web sites, CARFAX will
    collect any information you submit in connection with your request,
    including but not limited to, name, email address, telephone number, and
    any personalized message included in your request. In addition, CARFAX may

    for vehicles or creating an account such as zip code and/or type of vehicle
    viewed. If you call a toll-free telephone number provided on any CARFAX web

    your call and the phone number from which the call originated, along with
    other information that may be captured, and all such captured information
    may be used as described in this Privacy Statement.
    <br>
    <br>
    CARFAX may also allow you to (1) enter information regarding your vehicle,

    CARFAX web sites may contain web beacons to collect data regarding user
    traffic patterns. CARFAX web sites use cookies to collect information about

    identifiers etc.) and software, including but not limited to, referring
    domains, the type of browser used, operating system software, screen
    resolutions, color capabilities, IP addresses and plug-ins. We may collect,
    or have a third party collect on our behalf, data on the number of visits,
    paths taken, time spent on CARFAX web sites, how visitors use and navigate
    through the CARFAX web sites (examples include, the number of users who
    visit various pages within the CARFAX web sites, information accessed by
    such visitors, whether they scroll up or down on particular pages or
    complete any forms). Currently, CARFAX uses third-party software to monitor
