      At CARFAX, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect
      to process orders and to provide a more useful and personalized experience on our site. Please

      <a href="#top"><font size="1">(back to top)</font></a><br>
      When you order CARFAX Vehicle History Reports, we require your name, mailing address,
      e-mail address, credit card number, and expiration date. This information allows us to process
      your order and deliver your reports to you.</p>

      <p>For each CARFAX Vehicle History Report you request, you will also enter the Vehicle
      Identification Number (VIN). This is the unique 17-character identification number that is used
      to search our database for information about the vehicle's history.  Once you enter the VIN of
      a vehicle, the CARFAX report will appear on screen and an email version of the same CARFAX Report
      will be sent to you via email for your records.  </p>

      <p>You may be asked to complete brief surveys while on the CARFAX web site. These surveys help us
      to better understand how you are using the information, and help us to develop better products
      and services for you. These surveys may be administered by CARFAX or by a third party.</p>
      
      <p>You may receive periodic email communications from CARFAX that include special offers and
      promotions related to the used car buying and ownership process.  Should you choose to "opt-out" of
      receiving these email communications, you will only receive the email communications that contain the
      CARFAX Reports you order. To unsubscribe to any of our communications or have any questions about
      our services or our products, please <a href="http://carfax.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/carfax.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php?">

      <p>We also track user traffic patterns to uncover ways in which we can improve the site and make it
      easier to use. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how many customers look at each page.</p>

      <a href="#top"><font size="1">(back to top)</font></a><br>
