<h2>The Way We Use Information</h2>
<p>We do not directly collect your banking or credit card information when you place an order with us, and as such we do not store this information in our records (outside of the basic log data sent to us by the payment processor).

Additionally, you can log into your Control Panel, and elect not to receive notifications from the administrator.  Only under extremely rare and important circumstances would we override this election on your part when contacting you.</p>

<p>We may use generic statistical information to better enhance our site.  For example, we may group activity on our site based on gender, geographical location, or age - however at no time when reviewing statistical information would we use or supply personally identifying information such as your name or address.</p>

<p>Any information submitted to us during registration, ordering, or normal use of our website will not be used for any purpose other than for it's stated intentions, except as outlined above.</p>

  	
<h2>Our Commitment to Data Security</h2>
