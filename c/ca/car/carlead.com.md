Information Carsmart.com Collects 

Carsmart.com collects e-mail addresses of consumers who communicate with us via e-mail. Information on web pages visited and other information volunteered by consumers such as survey information and/or site registrations are also collected. Information collected for purchase requests includes name, address, and phone numbers, e-mail address and specific vehicle information. Information collected for private ad listings includes name, zip code, phone number, email address, specific vehicle information, and credit card information. 

Collected information is used to improve the content of our Web site, customize the content and/or layout of our Web site for individual users, notification of updates to our Web site and is also used to contact consumers for marketing purposes. Purchase request information is used to route requests to our accredited dealers, manufacturers and fulfillment partners, and to contact consumers regarding vehicle purchases. This information may be shared with other reputable organizations only if the consumer gives permission. For private ad listings, only the vehicle information is made available to potential buyers. When a potential buyer wishes to contact the seller, the seller receives a notice and logs in to the CarSmart.com website to view potential buyer's name, phone number and email address. Credit card information collected for the private ad listings is used solely for charging the listing fee and is shared only with the third party credit card processing company, Verisign CFX Tag. 

Who Owns Purchase Request Data? 

Purchase Request information, including your name, e-mail address, home address and vehicle information, becomes the property of Carsmart.com once it is received in our database. This information is passed on to our accredited dealers, manufacturers and fulfillment partners for completion of the sale pursuant to contractual rights granted by Carsmart.com. Once our accredited dealer receives this information, it becomes the property of the dealership in addition to Carsmart.com. Our accredited dealers use this information to process your purchase request and provide valuable services. Any request to opt out of future dealer communications must be made directly to the dealer. 

Personalization

Carsmart.com offers its users the advantage of personalization on our Web site by using cookies. (see Cookies) You will see this personalization in the "My Garage" area, in the saving of favorite vehicle information in "My Showroom", and used vehicle searches. Personalization in the "My Garage" area creates an individual experience for users by displaying the user's name and current vehicle information. 

If you use our used vehicle searches, our Web site will remember your login name. Our used car page will remember previous vehicle searches you have made. Web site personalization provides our customers with a more convenient online experience and is at no given time used to track information or retrieve data from your hard drive. 

Cookies

Carsmart.com offers consumers the convenience of online personalization by using cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. When this information is stored on your hard drive, our system is able to recognize your browser and in turn customize web page content for you. (See Personalization) 

Cookies cannot be used to retrieve data from your hard drive, obtain your e-mail address or obtain sensitive information about you. When a cookie is set, your browser will check it for length, an expiration date, and where it originated. Only Carsmart.com can access the cookies that we set. 

Carsmart.com allows our ad service company to set cookies as well. These cookies can "recognize" a consumer by a Unique identifier assigned at the time of the first visit, and may be used to measure site and page visits and browser version number. These cookies cannot obtain private information like name, e-mail or other personal information, and are not shared with Carsmart.com. 

We use a third party tracking service who sets cookies on our site to track visits, page views and click stream behavior. The third party tracking service reports this data to use in aggregate so we can better understand our users and to improve our site. This information is not tied to any individual user. 

If you prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will explain how to disable cookies under the help portion of the toolbar or notify you when you receive a new cookie. However, if you choose to disallow cookies on your hard drive, our Web site will not be able to provide personalization services. 

Clear GIFs 

CarSmart.com uses clear GIFs to track user movement through the site for aggregated site traffic metrics. In addition, some CarSmart.com affiliates set Clear GIFs on our web pages to track completed Purchase Requests and Private Ad listings referred from their websites. 

Shared information

You will be notified that your information is forwarded at the time you submit your purchase request. At that time you will become subject to the security and privacy policies that are posted on those Web sites at www.autobytel.com, or www.Autoweb.com.

We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these outside service providers, because their privacy practices may differ from ours.
