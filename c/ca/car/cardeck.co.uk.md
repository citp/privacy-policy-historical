    * A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.

    * You can manage your preferences relating to the use of cookies on our website by visiting ‘http://cardeck.co.uk/settings’.
