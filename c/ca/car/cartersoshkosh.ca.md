_Personally Identifiable Information_

We may collect personally identifiable information from you, such as your name, email address, physical address, phone number, credit card number, gender, birthday, your children’s names, and your children’s gender when you order products through one of our websites or by phone; purchase our products in our stores; save your information with us online; sign up to receive promotional materials over email or in the mail; or participate in a contest, promotion or survey. Some of the personally identifiable information we collect from you, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, and credit card information, is required in order to process your online order, respond to your requests, and contact you about your order, if necessary. Other information we may request is optional information, which you may choose not to provide, but which helps us make relevant suggestions and offers to you based on your shopping history, children’s ages, etc. 

_Non-Personally Identifiable Information_

We also collect non-personally identifiable information when you use our website that enables us to enhance your shopping experience by tailoring information to fit your personal taste and interests, such as the information about your product interests and purchases. Examples of non-personally identifiable information include the date and time of your visit, the originating IP address, the pages and images requested, and your purchases.

_Cookies_

Like most websites, we may place cookies on your computer to collect information about how you use our websites. The information that we collect about you through cookies is not personally identifiable. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies for a variety of purposes, such as to improve the quality of our services and the design and content of our websites; to track user trends; to enable us to provide a more personalized experience when you browse our websites; and keep you up to date on products, promotions, and other email communications that may be of interest. 

Cookies may help us collect information about the browser types, pages visited, purchases made, date and time of your visit, and other click-stream data. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to be alerted when a cookie is being sent. However, some of our features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

We also use third-party providers to help us collect and analyze information on our websites and to measure the effectiveness of information displayed on our websites. Such service providers may place cookies on your computer on our behalf when you access our websites. For example, we work with Coremetrics to help us understand how users interact with our websites. Coremetrics will place cookies on your computer to collect information on our behalf, including information about which search engine referred you, which items you placed in shopping carts, which items you abandoned, and what purchases you made. Coremetrics then analyzes the information it collects from our websites, and reports back to us. We use the information to help us understand your interests and how to better serve you. It also helps us provide you with more personalized product offerings. You may choose to opt out of Coremetrics' collection and analysis of your browsing and purchasing data. You may also choose to continue to benefit from the improved shopping experience that Coremetrics’ analysis allows us to provide, but maintain your anonymity. Learn more about Coremetrics [See Coremetrics Opt Out implementation instructions] and the various levels of privacy and confidentiality you can select with respect to Coremetrics’ services, as well as how to exercise your opt out choices.

We may use information you provide to us for a variety of purposes, including to process and fulfill your transactions, such as purchases, refunds and exchanges; to contact you about new products, services, special events and promotions; to conduct contests, sweepstakes and promotions, if you signed up to participate; to respond to your requests, inquiries and complaints; to help us learn about your shopping preferences; to help us improve our websites, stores, products and services; and to enhance your shopping experience. We may combine any information collected about you in stores with that collected through our websites in order to enhance and personalize your shopping experience, and for promotional purposes.

All personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information we collect about you may be shared with our affiliates and subsidiaries so that they may assist us in fulfilling the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We may also share personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information about you with unaffiliated third parties for purposes of providing services to us. When you complete a purchase, we may share information about you and your purchase with other companies for the purpose of processing your transaction, including credit card authorization, and order processing and fulfillment. We may share your information with our other service providers who collect, manage and analyze our customer information on our behalf and perform services on our behalf, such as sending promotions and other communications and conducting contests and surveys. Some of our service providers may be located outside of Canada. For more information about our policies and practices related to the use of foreign service providers, please contact our Privacy Officer as described below.

Subject to applicable laws, we may also share your information with third parties when we believe such disclosure is required to (i) comply with laws, regulations and/or government policies; (ii) comply with court orders, legal processes, or government enforcement actions; (iii) establish or exercise our legal rights, protect our rights and interests, or defend against legal claims; or (iv) detect, investigate, prevent, or take action with respect to illegal activities, suspected fraud or misconduct, securities or technical issues, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our Terms of Use or our Privacy Policy.

We may provide your information to carefully selected unaffiliated companies when we believe their products or services may be of interest to you or to other merchants and merchant exchanges who may, in turn, use such information for marketing purposes. If for any reason you do not wish us to share your information with unaffiliated third parties who use it for marketing purposes, please contact us as described in the below entitled section “How do I contact you?”.

In the event we, or any of our affiliates or subsidiaries, are involved in a business transaction such as a proposed or actual purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession), lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance or financing of all or any portion of our company or of any of the business or assets or shares of our company or a division thereof, we may transfer your personal information to the buyer in order for you to continue to receive the same products and services from the third party, and your personal information may become subject to a different privacy policy.
