  <p><b>Caribou Coffee Privacy Statement July, 2016 </b><br> Caribou Coffee Company, Inc.

Therefore, this online Privacy Statement tells you about the information Caribou Coffee collects through the services available on www.cariboucoffee.com (the "Site"), and how we use that information. </p>
<p>By using the Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Statement, as modified by us from time to time. If we change this Privacy Statement, we will post a notice on the home page of www.cariboucoffee.com and change the date at the top of this Privacy Statement, so that you are always aware of the information that we collect and how we use it. Therefore, we encourage you to check this page periodically for updates or changes whenever you visit the Site. </p>
<p>All changes will become effective when posted, and by continuing to use the Site following the posting of any changes, you agree to be bound by such modified Privacy Statement. </p>
<p><b>The Information We Collect and How We Use It </b><br> When you visit and use the Site, we gather certain information to help us better serve you. The information that we receive and collect depends on what you do when you visit the Site. </p>
<p>Except as described in this Privacy Statement, we do not sell, rent, share or disclose the personally identifiable information that you provide to us (which is information that can be used to identify you individually) with any other organization. Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. </p>
<p>Currently, Caribou Coffee sends personally identifiable information to third-party service providers that work on our behalf to provide services relating to the ongoing maintenance and operation of the Site. </p>
<p>These third parties do not have the right to use the personally identifiable information beyond what is necessary to assist us.

<p>Some of our employees have access to customer information only in order to serve customers or maintain our information systems. These employees are subject to our corporate privacy policy. </p>
<p><b>Submitting an Order </b><br> When you submit an order we ask for your name, email address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, fax number and credit card information. Your credit card information is sent to, and processed by third party financial institutions and their vendors. These service providers receive this information only for the purpose of verifying your credit card information, and for processing payment for your order, and they are obligated to keep this information confidential. </p>
<p><b>Registering your Caribou Gift Card</b><br> When you register your Caribou Gift Card on the Site, we ask for your name, email address, phone number and mailing address. This information is collected solely for the administration of our Caribou Gift Card program, and for replacing your Caribou Gift Card in the event it is lost or stolen. </p>
<p><b>Submitting a Resume</b><br> If you are interested in applying for a job with Caribou Coffee, we collect the information asked for in the online application, and we use that information solely for the purpose of matching your experience and preferences with the job openings we have, and someone from Caribou Coffee may contact you to ask for your resume and to discuss potential employment opportunities.
