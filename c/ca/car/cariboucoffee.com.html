  <h1>Your Privacy</h1>
  
  <p><b>Caribou Coffee Privacy Statement June 3, 2003 </b><br> Caribou Coffee Company, Inc. ("Caribou Coffee") knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully. Therefore, this online Privacy Statement tells you about the information Caribou Coffee collects through the services available on www.cariboucoffee.com (the "Site"), and how we use that information. </p>
<p>By using the Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Statement, as modified by us from time to time. If we change this Privacy Statement, we will post a notice on the home page of www.cariboucoffee.com and change the date at the top of this Privacy Statement, so that you are always aware of the information that we collect and how we use it. Therefore, we encourage you to check this page periodically for updates or changes whenever you visit the Site. </p>
<p>All changes will become effective when posted, and by continuing to use the Site following the posting of any changes, you agree to be bound by such modified Privacy Statement. </p>
<p><b>The Information We Collect and How We Use It </b><br> When you visit and use the Site, we gather certain information to help us better serve you. The information that we receive and collect depends on what you do when you visit the Site. </p>
<p>Except as described in this Privacy Statement, we do not sell, rent, share or disclose the personally identifiable information that you provide to us (which is information that can be used to identify you individually) with any other organization. Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. </p>
<p>Currently, Caribou Coffee sends personally identifiable information to third-party service providers that work on our behalf to provide services relating to the ongoing maintenance and operation of the Site. </p>

If you refuse cookies, you will not be able to open a shopping cart on the Site, and therefore will not be able to complete an order with us online. </p>
<p>Caribou Coffee uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website.

It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

A customer has the right to choose not to receive Caribou text messages by simply notifying us of their preference or responding STOP to 65017. This process is commonly termed opting-out or unsubscribing. </p>
<p>Caribou keeps your cell phone number private at all times. As the term suggests, "customer identifiable information" is information which can be associated with a specific individual or entity, including, for example, a customer's name, address, or telephone number or any preferences. </p>
<p>Caribou does not knowingly, directly or passively, collect information cell phone information from children under the age of 13.
