### HOW WE WILL USE YOUR INFORMATION

All personal information that we obtain about you will be recorded, used, and protected by us in accordance with current data protection legislation, our Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy. We will primarily use your personal information:

  * to provide the services you request from us 
  * to communicate with you in the event that any services you have requested are unavailable for record keeping purposes 
  * to carry out market research so that we can improve the services we offer

### MOLSON COORS BREWING COMPANY (UK) LIMITED COMMERCIAL PARTNER PROGRAMME

The Molson Coors Brewing Company (UK) Limited Commercial Partner programme is designed to help our website users to find products and services at competitive prices. The programme includes organisations with which we have a business relationship that have a range of products and services available.

### OFFERS AND OPPORTUNITIES

We and/or our Commercial Partners would like to contact you to tell you more about the offers available to you and about a range of other initiatives in a number of ways, including by post, telephone, text/picture/video message or by email.

### USE OF YOUR INFORMATION OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION

Some of the organisations to which we may disclose your personal information may be situated outside of the European Union. In order to provide you with the products and services you require, we may need to transfer your personal information to these countries some of which do not have laws that protect privacy rights as extensively as in the United Kingdom.

### CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

Privacy laws and practice are constantly developing and we aim to meet high standards. Our policies and procedures are, therefore, under continual review.
