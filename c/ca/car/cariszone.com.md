************How Secure is the Customer Personal Information?



  1. Because we are committed to protecting the security of your information, when information is received, and during transmission of information, we warrant safety of information by using **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software** , which encrypts information you input. The Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology is a vital part of the security features offered by Cariszone.com and aims to protect cardholder information from being seen on the open Internet during a purchase transaction. For example when you enter your personal information on our website’s log in page, and you enter submit, the SSL technology is used to protect your information as it is transmitted to us. Another example is when you are about to make a purchase online and you enter all the relevant details as it pertains to yourself and your credit card; to make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser. If you see an ‘unbroken key’ or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or Location line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from "http" to "https." If for any reason you cannot access the secure server, or if you're not quite comfortable shopping online at any websites, please feel free to place your order with us by telephone at the number listed in the section entitled, "Contact Cariszone.com", below.


  2. We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate Credit Card Processor at the Local Financial Institution (Bank) during order processing. 


  3. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer or even your personal computer.
