 				<p>Care.com, Inc. ("Care.com") is committed to protecting the privacy of your

				operate our company with protecting your sensitive personal 
				information in mind. This privacy policy covers the service offered at the <a href="/">Care.com</a> Website (the "Site")
				and outlines the type of information we collect, its uses, and steps
				we take to safeguard it.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify;">
				<img src="/img/truste_seal_ctv.gif" style="float:right; padding: 0px 0 5px 10px; cursor:pointer;" onclick="window.open('http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.care.com&amp;sealid=101','myWindow','menubar=1, scrollbars=yes, width=600,height=450')">
				Care.com, Inc. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. 
				TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission 
				is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by 
				promoting the use of fair information practices.  This privacy 
				statement covers the Care.com Website at <a href="/">www.care.com</a>.  Because 
				this Website wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, 
				it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its 
				privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
				
				<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, 
				you should first contact our Legal 
				Dept. at <a href="mailto:legal@care.com">legal@care.com</a>.  If 
				you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry

				<p><b>Information We Collect</b><br>
				Care.com is committed to helping match users who are seeking home or
				care services ("Care Seekers") to users who are providers of home or
				care services ("Care Providers"). Accordingly, we collect user
				submitted personally identifying information and other information
				specific to the services requested or provided. As part of providing
				you our services, we may obtain personal information from the
				following sources:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Information you provide to us on forms that you enter on the 
					Site or that you provide to us in writing.</li>
					<li>Information that you provide to us by telephone, such as 
					when you contact our customer care department.</li>
					<li>Information we receive automatically when you visit our web
					site. Please see "Cookies and other Technical Data" below.</li>
					<li>Information from third parties, including verification 
					services, payment processing services, and other online and offline
					sources. For example, this would include information we receive from
					a third-party verification service in response to a user requesting a
					background check on themselves. It would also include updated address
					or contact information that we might use to correct our records so
					that we can communicate with you more easily.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>The information we collect may include: first name, last name,
				city, state, address, ZIP code, phone, email address and other
				information specific to the service requested or provided. If you
				become a registered subscriber we may collect your credit card
				information and billing address. If you become a registered Care
				Provider, we may collect your date of birth, gender, company name (if
				applicable), and ZIP codes served. If you are a company or agency 
				registering as a Care Provider, we may also collect information 
				about the company including the tax id, the year established, and 
				the number of employees.  If you request a background check
				on yourself we may collect your Social Security Number. In addition,
				if you request a background check on yourself we may obtain criminal
				background information from a third-party verification service. Use of
				such a verification service is voluntary.</p>
				
				<p>We may also collect information about third-party references from Care 
				Providers. This information may include the name, phone number, and email 
				address of the third-party reference. This information is collected when a
				Care Provider creates or updates their profile. This information is 
				collected so that a Care Seeker or Care.com acting on behalf of a Care 
				Seeker can contact the third-party reference to verify information 
				provided by the Care Provider. The information collected about third-party
				references will not be used for other purposes including marketing.  
				If a third-party reference would like to have their information removed 
				from Care.com, they can contact Care.com Member Care at 
				membercare@care.com.</p>
				
				<p>If you use our blog on this Site, you should be aware that any personally 
				identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used 
				by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited 
				messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable 
				information you choose to submit in this forum.</p>
				
				<p>We use the information we obtain to develop and deliver our
				services and to fulfill legal requirements. We limit the collection
				and use of customer information to the minimum we require to deliver
				superior service to our customers and to administer our business.				
				</p>
				
				<p>Providing your information is voluntary and you can always
				choose not to provide it by choosing not to use our Site, services, or
				features.</p>
				
				<p><b>Cookies and Other Technical Data</b><br>
				Our web servers also use "cookies". A cookie is a small text
				file that is stored on a user's computer. We use cookies to administer
				and customize our service and to better understand, on an aggregate
				basis, how users interact with our Site. If you choose to disable
				cookies, you may not be able to use certain features of the Site. For
				example, we require that you have cookies enabled to enroll in our
				service or to log in to your account. We do not store any personally
				identifiable information in cookies.</p>

				<p>As is true of most web sites, when you visit our Site we gather certain
				information automatically and store it in log files. We gather technical
				information about your computer such as your IP address, operating system,
				browser type, pages visited, manner of connection to the Internet, and
				referring URL. We use this information in aggregate to analyze trends
				and administer our service. The information that we collect through
				log files is not tied to personally identifiable information.</p>

				<p>We and/or advertising affiliates may employ "tracking pixels"
				(also referred to as "web beacons") to count the number of users that
				visit a page on our Site that includes these tracking pixels. Tracking
				pixels are used to analyze the effectiveness of advertising campaigns
				and to better understand the way that users interact with our Site.
				These tracking pixels do not identify individual users and analysis of
				data obtained by these tracking pixels is performed on an aggregate
				basis.</p>
				
				<p>We also employ a third-party service provider to assist in tracking
				site usage. This service provider uses cookies and "tracking pixels" to
				collect information on our behalf about the pages you visit while on our
				site. This service allows us to better administer the site and our
				service. The data collected by this service provider does not identify
				individual users and the analysis of this data is performed on an
				aggregate basis.</p>
				
				<p>We may use third-party advertising companies, such as Performics 
				Inc., to serve or track ads on our web site and other web sites.  
				These companies may use non-personally identifiable information about 
				your visits to this and other web sites in order to measure 
				advertising effectiveness and to provide advertisements about 
				goods and services that may be of interest to you.  To find out 
				more about the use of cookies and the information-gathering 
				practices and opt-out procedures of Performics, please <a href="http://performics.com/our_company_files/privacy.htm" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
		
				<p><b>Third Party Information Sharing</b><br>
				The information collected by Care.com is used in the operation of
				the Site, including the sharing of certain Care Seeker information 
				with prospective Care Providers and vice/versa. In addition, we may
				share your personal information with third parties that offer related
				products or services. However, we will only do so with your consent. </p>
				
				<p>We do not share your personal information with other third
				parties except as permitted or required by law or as described within this
				privacy policy and including the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In order to provide our services, we may share any of 
					the information we gather about you with agents and service
					providers to perform functions on our behalf, such as to
					send email, process background checks, host videos (if you
					decide to post one to your account), or process credit card
					payments. In addition, address information may be shared
					with a service provider to determine geographic information.
					These service providers have access to personal information
					needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for
					other purposes.</li>
		
					<li>We may disclose personal information about you to third
					parties when we believe such disclosure is appropriate to comply with
					a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena
					or search warrant, or in the course of a legal proceeding. We may
					also disclose personal information as we believe appropriate to
					enforce or apply our rights under our agreements with customers, to
					protect the rights, property or safety of Care.com, our customers and
					others, including exchanging information for fraud protection and
					credit risk reduction.</li>
		
					<li>If there is a change of control in Care.com's business
					(whether by merger, sale, or otherwise), its customer information
					could be sold as part of that transaction and your personally
					identifying information potentially could be used by the purchaser.
					However, if that business materially changes this statement or the
					information-handling practices as described in this statement, you 
					will be notified by email and/or through a notice posted on our Site, 
					and you will have a choice as to whether your existing information is 
					used in a new manner.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Your Choices</b><br>
				Care.com provides users the ability to opt-out of receiving email 
				communications from us. If you wish to cease future communications, 
				you can opt-out by using the link on the bottom of an email that you 
				receive from Care.com or, if you are a registered member, by visiting 
				the Profile section of your account.</p>
				<p>Care.com reserves the right to send you specific administrative 
				notices that are required by law, regulation, or as needed to service 
				your account. Administrative notices also include notifications of new 
				messages or job postings in your area and responses to jobs that you have posted. 
				You may not opt-out of receiving these administrative emails.</p>
				<p>Care Providers have the ability to suppress certain 
				information, such as their phone number(s), from displaying to Care 
				Seekers. Care Providers can set such preferences in the Profile 
				section of their account.</p>

				<p>Care.com provides the ability for a user to conduct a background 
				check on themselves with a third-party verification service. If you 
				decide to use this service, a summary of the background check 
				results are made available to you on the Site. You have control 
				over which other users can view the results of your background check. 
				The results may include personal information, such as your first name 
				and last name. Your use of such a service is voluntary.</p>
		

				<p><b>Your Access to Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
				If your personally identifiable information changes, you may update this 
				information by logging into your account and accessing the "Profile" 
				section within "My Account". If you no longer wish to participate in our 
				service you may contact Care.com Member Care at membercare@care.com and 
				request that your account be closed.</p> 
				
				<p><b>How We Protect Your Information</b><br>
				Care.com is committed to earning and keeping your trust and we understand 
				the need to keep your information secure and private. As a result we have
				implemented industry-recognized safeguards to protect your information.
				These safeguards include:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>
					Care.com is registered with Verisign, the leading provider of digital 
					authentication services and products for electronic commerce and other
					forms of secure communications. With Verisign, you can be assured that
					your communication with the Care.com web site is secure. We use SSL 
					(Secure Socket Layer), the industry standard method for computers to
					communicate securely without risk of manipulation or recipient 
					impersonation. We utilize SSL in the online registration process, in 
					the login process, and in the account management section of the Site.
				</li>
				<li>
					Care.com uses encryption technology to protect sensitive information 
					such as credit card information, date of birth, and information 
					related to background checks.
				</li>
				<li>				
					Care.com employs firewalls and system monitoring to protect against
					 unauthorized access of our systems. 
				</li>					 
				</ul>

				<p>Please remember that you also play a valuable role in data security. 
				You should never share your Care.com password with anyone. If you feel 
				your password has been compromised, you should change it immediately by 
				logging into your account and accessing the "Profile" section within 
				"My Account". After you have finished using our Site, you should log out
				of your Care.com account and exit your browser.
				</p>
		
				<p><b>Privacy Policy Changes</b><br>
				This Privacy Policy may change, from time to time, due to changes on 
				our Site, legal developments, business factors and ever-changing 
				technology. Notifications to changes of our Privacy Policy will be 
				posted on our Site, and other places we deem appropriate so that you 
				are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under 
				what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to 
				modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it 
				frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify 
				you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>
