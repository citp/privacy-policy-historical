Your privacy is important to us. To help you understand how we protect your privacy, we have adopted a policy that explains our online information practices. Our Privacy Policy is available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

This web site (the "Site") is operated by CarSoup. The Privacy Policy that follows describes CarSoup's collection, use and disclosure of information practices in connection with the Site. This Policy applies to the national version of the Site, located at [www.carsoup.com](http://www.carsoup.com/), as well as to any versions of the Site that CarSoup co-brands or private labels with its media affiliates and other partners (collectively "Affiliates"). For example, you may have arrived at a co-branded version of the Site from an Affiliate's web site, in which case, that Affiliate will be clearly identified at the top of the home page of this Site. In this Policy, CarSoup refers to those versions of the Site as "Affiliate Versions". Please be aware that an Affiliate Version is customized by CarSoup for the Affiliate, with whom CarSoup may share any information you submit through this Site, as described below. During your visit to any Affiliate Version, the Affiliate may independently collect other information from you.

This Policy does not describe CarSoup's collection, use and disclosure of information through means other than this Site (e.g., off-line) or the collection, use and disclosure practices of any Affiliate or other third party. For information on the privacy policy applicable to an Affiliate's information collection, use and disclosure practices, please review the privacy policy on the applicable Affiliate's web site. Also, please note that this Site contains links to other web sites. CarSoup and its Affiliates are not responsible for the web sites, content, or privacy practices of any third party. By using this Site, you acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to the CarSoup terms of service.

 **Your Consent** :

By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information by CarSoup.com. This Policy explains what personally identifiable information may be collected. We have established a procedure for handling claims if you believe that your personal information has been improperly used by us. That procedure is also described in this Policy. It must be followed if you have any such claims.

 **How (and what) we learn about you:**

CarSoup collects personally identifiable information about you to improve your auto buying and selling experience. In most cases, our collection of personal information involves you affirmatively giving that information to us to receive services or to participate in specific site activities:

  * When you register with the site to use features such as My Garage and Car Detective, we ask for your e-mail address and additional information to help refine your searches and allow us to serve you better.
  * When you place an ad with CarSoup, we ask for your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This allows us to process and post your ad as quickly as possible and to notify you of its status. This same information allows us to accurately process your order for CarSoup products and services.
  * When you participate in a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address so we can administer the contest or promotion.
  * When you visit our web site, we use third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads to you on our behalf. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp>.



In order to make your visits to our site more productive and enjoyable, we use "cookies" to track your visits. Downloaded onto your computer from our servers, cookies record information that helps our site respond to your preferences and interests. Cookies cannot be opened or run on your computer and they cannot infect your computer with viruses. You can disable cookies or otherwise manage them through tools provided with your browser software and with third-party software packages. If you turn off cookies, many CarSoup features will not work as well or at all.

 **What we do with what you tell us:**

We have programs in place that seek to ensure that any credit card information you provide to complete a transaction with us is used solely for that purpose.

We use personally identifiable information about you to better provide the services that cause you to visit our site. Unless you tell us, in writing, that you don't want your personal information used for other purposes, (a) we may use your information to inform you about products, services, and promotions that might be of potential interest to you, as well as to get your feedback about our site and partners, and (b) we may send personally identifying information to third parties, such as auto dealers, advertisers, and radio/TV stations who work with CarSoup to provide products and services to you. Generally, this sharing of information occurs because you specifically request additional information, such as a vehicle price quote. CarSoup does not control what these third parties may do with personally identifiable information they receive. However, we believe that all of our service partners have their own privacy policies in place.

In addition, we use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. These statistics might be shared with auto dealers, advertisers, and media sponsors, and include statistics on visitors to a promotion or advertisement, or describe general characteristics about our site users.

 **Data Security** :

CarSoup's Secure Server Software (SSL) encrypts all account and personal information you input before it is sent to us. In addition, all customer data we collect is carefully protected from unauthorized access.

 **Ad Banners & Affiliate Links**:

CarSoup may run advertisements and services offers from third party advertisers, sponsors, and other companies. What happens to any personal information you provide in response to those advertisements and offers can be obtained by contacting the company who makes the advertisement or offer. Furthermore, we may establish links to sponsor, affiliate, advertiser or other sites. CarSoup is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any sites promoted on Carsoup.com or to which links on CarSoup.com connect.

 **Sellers of Vehicles** :

You may provide personal information to dealers, private parties, or other entities who are offering to sell vehicles on CarSoup.com. CarSoup is not responsible for what any of those entities do with personal information you provide to them, even if that information is provided through use of CarSoup.com.

 **Review of Information Collected** :

We do not currently have a process by which you can review or request changes to personally identifiable information collected by us. We will do the best we can to respond to review requests but can make no promises about our ability to respond quickly or effectively to your request. Any such request should be made to [help@carsoup.com.](mailto:help@carsoup.com) As we make future changes to the site, we may explore ways in which we could create a process by which consumers can review or request changes to personally identifiable information we collect.

 **Complaint Procedure** : If you feel that any of your personal information or other data collected from or about you has been used improperly, please immediately contact [help@carsoup.com.](mailto:help@carsoup.com) We will ask you to detail what improper action you believe to have occurred. Upon receipt of that information, we will promptly investigate your complaint. If we cannot reach a mutually agreeable resolution of your complaint, either of us can initiate an arbitration proceeding to be conducted under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association at its Minneapolis, MN office. This arbitration procedure is the exclusive manner of resolving unresolved privacy-related complaints unless this dispute resolution procedure is inconsistent with the laws of your State. The arbitrator will determine if CarSoup violated this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information or otherwise violated duties imposed by law on CarSoup relating to privacy issues. The arbitrator will also determine what actual damage you suffered if the arbitrator rules that we have done something wrong. In no event will CarSoup be liable for any consequential damages, including lost profits; any emotional distress, pain and suffering or similar tort damages; or any punitive or exemplary damages unless (a) the arbitrator determines that we acted maliciously and with specific intent of harming you in the use of your personal information, or (b) the arbitrator decides this limitation of liability is ineffective under the laws of your State.

 **Your Opinion** :

Please feel free to direct any questions or comments about our privacy policy to [help@carsoup.com](mailto:help@carsoup.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Question).
