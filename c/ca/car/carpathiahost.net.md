#### Privacy Policy

QTS is committed to maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of the personal information that we collect. For these reasons, we are disclosing to you our practices in gathering and using information that you provide us. 

#### What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Collect It?

In general, you can visit QTS on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Our web servers collect our visitors' domain names and IP addresses, but not personal email addresses. This information is used to diagnose problems with our server, measure the number of visits and number of pages viewed, and register methods by which our site was found, and methods used for viewing our site. QTS will use this information to evaluate how you use our Web site and how we can improve the content of the site.

Our analytics tools also collect information regarding the user. Specifically, this includes screen resolution, color depth, whether or not Java and Flash are installed, browser version, operating system, and mobile device type. A summary of this information, without identification of any individual user, is sometimes shared with certain third parties when discussing browser compatibility.

Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (such as their e-mail address), unique identifiers (like their names), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level).

On the QTS Customer Portal, we may collect personal information from individuals acting on behalf of our business clients, such as name, address, email address and phone number. The QTS Customer Portal generally provides access to company level operational information with some limited display of personal contact information of those accessing the portal or submitting a help desk ticket.
