Web Beacons  
We may use web beacons on the Website, in our advertisements on other sites and in e-mails. A web beacon is an electronic image that can be used to recognize a cookie on your computer when you view a web page or email. Web beacons allow us to recognize users by accessing our cookies. They help us measure the effectiveness of our site, our advertising and our email campaigns in various ways, for example, by counting the number of individuals who visit our site from a particular advertisement, as well as by telling us when a web page is viewed and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Web beacons also help us count the number of individuals who open or act upon an email message. The information we collect may include personal information. We may also combine the information that we collect through web beacons with other personal information we have collected from you, such as your registration information. We use this information to respond to your questions (for example, if you do not remember registering on the Website or don’t know how we received your email address).

Members of our affiliate program may also use web beacons to help us track the number of individuals the affiliate has directed to the Website. These web beacons do not collect any personal information.

We will not share any personal information collected through web beacons with any third party, except for service providers who act on our behalf and who are contractually prohibited from any other use or disclosure of the information.
