Personal Information – When you register with Careersandeducation.com, we collect personal information from you, including your email address, name, postal address, phone number, gender, and date of birth. We do not request collect sensitive personal information such as your credit card number, bank account information or social security number in order to register with Careersandeducation.com; however, when you choose to complete an advertising form in the registration process for one of our advertisers this sensitive information may be requested by the advertiser and therefore collected by Careersandeducation.com for the sole purpose of providing this information to the advertiser. Careersandeducation.com does not store or use this information for any other purpose. During this process we ensure that this information is encrypted in transit using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Please see the Security section below for additional information. 

**Submitting Information during the Registration Process:**   
During the registration process you will be directed through a number of third party websites displaying advertisements for Universities, Education Programs and other Special Offers that may be of interest to you. If you select "Yes" on any of these advertisements or choose to complete the forms provided, you will be asked to submit personal information. On behalf of certain advertisers, we will request sensitive personal information such as your credit card number or social security number. In all cases, when you click on the Submit button we will securely transfer your personal information to the third-party advertiser you selected. We will not use the information that you submit for transfer to a third-party advertiser for our own purposes; nor will we retain or disclose it. You may be prompted by some advertisers to answer additional questions. These pages may be "co-branded" or "framed." This means that they may appear to be part of our Website because they have a Careersandeducation.com look and feel, but they are, in fact, part of the advertiser's site. All framed pages contain the following disclaimer at the bottom of the page: "*By submitting the form above I agree to provide this information to the advertiser and to be contacted by this advertiser directly." On these framed pages, we do not collect any of the additional information you submit; the advertiser does, and it does not share this information with us. The advertiser uses your information to deliver additional information to you about its particular product or service and perhaps for other purposes. Its collection and use of your information is subject to its own privacy policy.

Third-Party Cookies - To try and bring you offers that are of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place third parties' ads on our Website. These companies may set and access their own cookies on your computer. This means that, as a result of your visit to our Website, these companies may collect non-personally identifiable information from you, such as your domain type, your IP address and clicking behavior. These cookies are not connected to any of your personal information. These companies' collection and use of your information are subject to their own privacy policies. 

Web Beacons - We may use web beacons on the Website, in our advertisements on other sites and in e-mails. A web beacon is an electronic image that can be used to recognize a cookie on your computer when you view a web page or email. Web beacons allow us to recognize users by accessing our cookies. They help us measure the effectiveness of our site, our advertising and our email campaigns in various ways, for example, by counting the number of individuals who visit our site from a particular advertisement, as well as by telling us when a web page is viewed and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. 

Web beacons also help us count the number of individuals who open or act upon an email message. The information we collect may include personal information. We may also combine the information that we collect through web beacons with other personal information we have collected from you, such as your registration information. We use this information to respond to your questions (for example, if you do not remember registering on the Website or don't know how we received your email address). 

We also use this information to prevent fraud by members of our affiliate program and others. We will not share any personal information collected through our web beacons with any third party, except for service providers who act on our behalf and who are contractually prohibited from any other use or disclosure of the information. You can make some web beacons unusable by rejecting cookies. 

Third-Party Web Beacons - Members of our affiliate program may use web beacons to help us track the number of individuals the affiliate has directed to the Website. The web beacons used by our affiliate program members do not collect any personal information.

**Security:**   
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter a credit card number and/or social security number on our advertisers' pages or on our registration or order forms, we ensure that information is encrypted in transit using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

**Information Sharing:**   
We share the information we collect from and about you as follows: We share your information with our employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries and service providers, if the disclosure will enable any of these entities to perform a business, professional or technical support function for us.
