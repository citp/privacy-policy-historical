	<h2>AIM Online Privacy Statement</h2>
AIM is committed to protecting your privacy. Please read the AIM Online Privacy Statement below and also any
supplemental information listed to the right for additional details about particular AIM sites and services
that you may use. This AIM Online Privacy Statement applies to data collected by AIM through the majority of
its Web sites and services, as well as its offline product support services.
<br><br>
	<h2>Collection of Your Personal Information</h2>
In order to access some AIM services, you will be asked to sign in with an e-mail address and password, which
we refer to as your credentials. At some AIM sites, we ask you to provide personal information, such as your
e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information,
such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. If you choose to make a purchase or
sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card
number and billing address that is used to create an AIM billing account. We may collect information about
your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with AIM
sites and services. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you
visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses. In
order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with AIM, information
collected through one AIM service may be combined with information obtained through other AIM services. 
<br><br>
	<h2>Use of Your Personal Information</h2>
AIM collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve its sites and deliver the services or
carry out the transactions you have requested. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer
service; making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same
information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and
displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences. We also use your
personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as
welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. We may
also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services
available from AIM and its affiliates. Sharing of Your Personal Information Except as described in this statement,
we will not disclose your personal information outside of AIM and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates
without your consent. Some AIM services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you
register for or use such services, both AIM and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction
with the co-branded services. We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is
necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on AIM; (b) protect and defend the rights or
property of AIM (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the
personal safety of users of AIM services or members of the public.
<br><br>
	<h2>Resumes And Resume Databases</h2>
AIM allows you to post your resume in our database. This feature allows you to market yourself to potential
employers. When you post your resume in our resume database, then all businesses subscribing to our services will
have access to your name, resume and contact information. We use our best efforts to grant access to this database
only to subscribing businesses, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not, without our consent, gain access
to this database. You may remove your resume from our search-able database at any time. However, businesses
subscribing to AIM services may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not
responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes
by any of such parties for resumes submitted to our database. By using your selected ID and password, you may, at
any time log in to the resume feature to, inactivate, change or correct your resume from the resume database or
inactivate, change or correct your name and contact information.
<br><br>
	<h2>Online Applications Hosted by AIM</h2>
Information you submit in response to a specific job posting is considered "personal information" and will be retained in our database. We use logins and passwords to protect this information. The information may also be provided in computer readable form directly to the respective employer for retention within system(s) that are solely under the control of that employer. We believe the employers represented on this site consider any resumes they receive to be valuable and worthy of appropriate protection; however, we cannot control how the application information provided to employers is used, stored, protected or distributed.
<br><br>
	<h2>Online Applications Not Hosted by AIM</h2>
Some employers request AIM to direct applicants to an online application hosted by the employer or by a third
party. AIM will attempt to provide notification when a visitor is leaving an AIM Web site. AIM is not responsible
for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. You should review the privacy policies of any other
Web site.
<br><br>
	<h2>Communication Preferences</h2>
You can stop the delivery of future promotional e-mail from AIM sites and services by following the specific
instructions in the e-mail you receive. These communication choices do not apply to mandatory service
communications that are considered part of certain AIM services, which you may receive periodically unless you
cancel the service. 
<br><br>
	<h2>Security of Your Personal Information</h2>
AIM is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security
technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or
disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access,
which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit
card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure
Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it
is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you
are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving a site or service to
protect access to your information from subsequent users.
<br><br>
	<h2>Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information</h2>
Many AIM sites and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal
information from children. When an AIM site does collect age information, and users identify themselves as
under 13, the site will either block such users from providing personal information, or will seek to obtain
consent from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information. We will not
knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide
our services. We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing
personal information online.
<br><br>
	<h2>Use of Third Party Ad Networks</h2>
The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on AIM Web pages are displayed by AIM. However, we
allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on AIM Web pages.
Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to recognize your computer
each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where
you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on.
This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most
interest to you. AIM does not have access to the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or
ad networks. AIM maintains a relationship with a third-party currently operating as Salary.com. Salary.com might
maintain relationships with a number of third-party ad servers or ad networks. Those ad networks that use
persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting. You may find more information at the Web site
of either the individual ad network or the Network Advertising Initiative at
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>.
<br><br>
	<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
This site may contain links to other sites. AIM is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of
such Web sites. You should review the privacy policies of any other Web site. 
<br><br>
	<h2>Controlling "Spam" or Unsolicited E-mail</h2>
AIM is concerned about controlling unsolicited commercial e-mail, or "spam." AIM will not sell, lease or rent
its e-mail subscriber lists to third parties.
<br><br>
	<h2>Enforcement of This Privacy Statement</h2>
If you have questions regarding this statement, you should first contact
<a href="mailto:privacy@aiminstitute.org">privacy@aiminstitute.org</a>.
<br><br>
	<h2>Changes to This Privacy Statement</h2>
We will occasionally update this privacy statement to reflect changes in our services and customer feedback.
When we post changes to this Statement, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this statement.
If there are material changes to this statement or in how AIM will use your personal information, we will notify
you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly
sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how AIM
is protecting your information.
<br><br>
	<h2>Contacting Us</h2>
AIM welcomes your comments regarding this privacy statement. If you have questions about this statement or
believe that we have not adhered to it, please contact 
<a href="mailto:privacy@aiminstitute.org">privacy@aiminstitute.org</a>.
