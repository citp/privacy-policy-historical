We are committed to protecting your privacy and to developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience. You can travel through most of our site without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use in those situations. Please read the complete CarInsurance.com privacy statement. By using CarInsurance.com, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

**Collecting your Personal Information**  
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are requesting a quote, service or giving us feedback about CarInsurance.com products. Personal information collected by CarInsurance.com often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested.

**Use of your Personal Information**  
We use your personal information for these primary purposes: 

  * To make the site easier for you to use by not making you enter your personal information more than once. 
  * To help you quickly find quotes, services or information on CarInsurance.com. 
  * To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you. 



Information collected on CarInsurance.com may be shared within CarInsurance.com, including its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates. We use other companies on this site and you may be giving information to them and not to CarInsurance.com. Additionally, we occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including quoting and answering customer questions about products or services. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

CarInsurance.com will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on CarInsurance.com or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of CarInsurance.com and its family of Web sites, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of CarInsurance.com, its Web sites, or the public.

It will only be used for the purposes stated above. We don't not control all information given on this site. Some quoting companies are used as a service on this website and the information you submit is not submitted to CarInsurance.com, but to them directly.

CarInsurance.com strictly protects the security of your personal information and honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under conditions explained above.

Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where CarInsurance.com, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located, and by using CarInsurance.com, you consent to any such transfer outside of your country.
