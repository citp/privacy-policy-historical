Personal Information:  
Any information you provide online will only be used to enhance your online experience at calumetphoto.com, unless you specifically indicate otherwise. Your email address will never be sold or shared with any other company. That's our guarantee.   
Your Mailing Address:  
When you register on our site, you will be asked for your name and address information. We ask for this information because without it we can't determine freight prices accurately for your shopping list. If you don't plan to place an order, you can simply choose not to provide address information. If, when you register, you prefer not to receive catalogs, just indicate that on the registration form. You can always change that preference at a later date. We'd ocassionally send email notification of special offers, or news about our site to registered users.   
Email Addresses:  
We have an email notification service for special offers and news about our site. We respect your privcy, and your email addresses will never be sold or shared with other organizations. You have the option during registration, or at any time thereafter to opt-out of this free service.
