<a name="1"><h2>1. <strong>What kinds of information does  Callaway Golf collect?</strong></h2></a>
<p>Callaway Golf websites can collect information about you in a number of  ways. One way we do this is by directly requesting information from you (such as  on a product order form when you make a purchase, during customer service communications,  as part of a sweepstakes or contest entry form, on registration pages, in  response to a survey or on similar web pages where you are able to enter  information into data fields and then send this information back to Callaway  Golf). You may be asked to provide us with your name, address, credit card  number, credit card expiration date, password reminders (such as your mother’s  maiden name or the name of your favorite pet), phone number, fax number, email  address, shipping address and similar information  about you as an individual. We may also ask you questions about your golf game,  your buying preferences or your lifestyle. We refer to all of this information  as your "<strong>Personal Information</strong>."</p>
<p>Another way  we collect information is by automatically recording information about your  visit to our websites. For example, we might collect data regarding your  activity while on our websites or record the web pages that you have chosen to  visit. This is a common practice for many websites on the Internet. The  information collected does not personally identify you, but may be helpful to  us for marketing purposes or improving the services we offer. We refer to this  type of information as "<strong>General  Data</strong>." For example, we automatically log visitors' domain and IP  addresses (a unique string of numbers that identifies a computer on the  Internet). At times, this General Data may be combined with the Personal  Information that you have provided.  As described below, we also use  cookies to enable the website to personalize your future visits and to help you  navigate.</p>
<p>From time to  time, you may also be given the opportunity to give us feedback about our  products or services or to post messages for others to read. Sometimes this is  done anonymously. Other times your name or other identifying features may be  attached. This process will always be voluntary and we will explain to you how  the information will be used whenever we ask for it.</p>
<p>Callaway  Golf intends to give you as much control as possible over your Personal  Information. In general, you can visit Callaway Golf on the Internet without  telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.  There are times, however, when we may need your Personal Information in order  to do such things as process an order, respond to your information requests or  to allow you to participate in online promotions.</p>
<p>If you  choose to give Callaway Golf Personal Information via the Internet, it is also  our intent to let you know how we will use such information. If you tell us  that you do not wish to have this Personal Information used as a basis for  further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.  For more information, you can call us at 800-200-4726  or 512-247-7617.  You can also email <a href="mailto:support@callawaygolfpreowned.com">support@callawaygolfpreowned.com</a> for more information or you can write to us by addressing requests to Internet  Customer Service Representative, Callaway Golf Pre-Owned &amp; Outlet, 9013 Tuscany Way,  Building 1, Suite 110,  Austin, Texas   78754.</p>

<h2>4. <strong>How do I let Callaway Golf  know that it is okay to contact me?</strong></h2>
</a>
<p>When you  make a purchase online at one of our websites, you will be asked to provide  certain Personal Information that will allow us to process the order.  By making a purchase with us online, you  agree that Callaway Golf and its fulfillment partners may contact you regarding  your order status and other order fulfillment issues.  If you are uncomfortable providing Personal  Information online, you can also make a purchase by calling us at 800-200-4726  or 512-247-7617.

<p>When you provide us with your  Personal Information, you also may be asked whether you would like to receive future  contacts from Callaway Golf and from our select business partners and  affiliates (as described in Section 8 below).   You elect to receive these future contacts by “<strong>opting in</strong>” in the designated check box.  Once you opt-in, you are granting us  permission to use the Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy,  including transferring and storing your Personal Information at one or more  locations within the United States of America. Your election to opt-in also is  your agreement that we may share your Personal Information with selected  business partners and affiliates. The opt-in process further means that  Callaway Golf and the entities that we share your Personal Information with (as  described below) may contact you directly in accordance with this Privacy  Policy. Whenever we share Personal Information pursuant to this Privacy Policy,  we will inform the party receiving it that the Personal Information may only be  used for a specific, limited purpose in accordance with this Privacy Policy and  as agreed upon in advance by  Callaway Golf. We also may use confidentiality agreements to further protect  Personal Information that becomes the property of Callaway Golf. <br>
If you  provide us with your mailing address, telephone number or facsimile number, and  tell us that we may contact you, we may also get in touch with you by one of  these methods.</p>
<p> </p>
<a name="5"><h2>5. <strong>What happens when I make an  online purchase at a Callaway Golf website?</strong></h2>
</a>
<p>Callaway  Golf collects and stores Personal Information that you provide to us when you  make an online purchase, conduct certain online transactions or communicate  offline with our customer service department.   When you place an order, open an account or make certain inquiries, you  will be asked to provide various Personal Information that we will collect, use  and store as described in this Privacy Policy.   Among other things, this Personal Information will be used to facilitate  your online transactions (including the processing and shipping of your orders),  send you order-related confirmations and provide you with customer service  support. This Personal Information also may be used to contact you about sales,  special offers and new site features, unless you have elected not to receive  promotional communications in connection with this website.</p>
<p>In some  instances, your Personal Information will be shared with and stored by third  parties who perform services and carry out functions on our behalf and/or in  connection with an order.  These include,  among others, third party payment and order processors, our network of  fulfillment entities (such as local retailers and other product distributors),  package delivery services, data management and analysis companies, marketing  professionals, fraud protection services, website evaluators and the like.</p>
<p>For example,  we may disclose Personal Information that we collect about you to third parties  who we use to provide order processing, fulfillment, financial, marketing or  other services on our behalf or as otherwise permitted or required by law.  In some cases, we use these companies or  individuals to service, process and fulfill transactions, to protect against  fraud, for institutional risk control, to respond to judicial process or to  perform other duties on our behalf. </p>
<p>We also may collect and store  information about you that we receive from other sources, to enable us to  update and correct the Personal Information contained in our database and to provide product recommendations and  special offers that we think will interest you.</p>

<h2>6. <strong>Where does Callaway Golf store  this information and is it secure?</strong></h2>
</a>
<p>Callaway  Golf operates in many countries throughout the world. To enable us to offer  consistent service to our customers, wherever they may live, we manage most of  our Internet sites from within the United States. Information may be  collected outside of the U.S.  and transferred to the U.S.  in certain instances.  Information that  we collect may also be transferred to and stored by third parties who perform  services and carry out functions on our behalf and/or in connection with an  order.  These include, among others,  third party payment and order processors, our network of fulfillment entities  (such as local retailers and other product distributors), package delivery  services, data management and analysis companies, marketing professionals,  fraud protection services, website evaluators and the like.  </p>
<p>Callaway  Golf takes precautions to protect your Personal Information, including our  policy of allowing access to this Personal Information to only to those  individuals and entities with a need to know. We also use available technology  and encryption, when legally required or when appropriate for your protection,  to provide a more secure environment and to reduce the chance of unauthorized  access.</p>
<p>Personal  Information is stored in a secure environment protected by a combination of  physical and technical measures.

<p>From  time-to-time, in order to provide you with the services, information and  products that you have requested, to fulfill an order, to conduct contests,  promotions or sweepstakes or to provide you with services, information and  products that we think might be of interest to you, we may share your Personal  Information with the following entities and individuals:</p>
<p><a name="whoweare"></a><strong>Our Corporate Entities:</strong> This includes  Callaway Golf Company and our subsidiaries (collectively, the "<strong>Callaway Golf Companies</strong>").  Currently, Callaway Golf has subsidiaries in the United   States, Canada,  Europe, Japan, Korea and Australia.

In  addition to the Callaway Golf® brand of products, Callaway Golf's brands  include, among others, Odyssey®, Top-Flite® and Ben Hogan®. To the extent that  Personal Information is shared among the Callaway Golf Companies, or to the  extent that one of our subsidiaries obtains your Personal Information directly  from you, we will inform them that the Personal Information may only be used in  accordance with this Privacy Policy. In the event that one or more of the  Callaway Golf Companies merges with, acquires or is acquired by another  company, in whole or in part, we may also share information with this other  business entity and/or transfer this information as a company asset.

<p><strong>Third Party Service Providers and Golf Retailers:</strong>  In some instances, your Personal Information  will be shared with third parties who perform services and carry out functions  on our behalf and/or in connection with a product order.  These include, among others, third party  payment and order processors, our network of fulfillment entities (such as  local retailers and other product distributors), package delivery services,  data management and analysis companies, marketing professionals, fraud  protection services, website  evaluators and the like.

<p>You may  request a copy of the Personal Information that Callaway Golf has collected.  You may also correct any inaccuracies contained in this Personal Information.

Please address  requests to Internet Customer Service Representative, Callaway Golf Pre-Owned  &amp; Outlet, 9013 Tuscany Way,  Building 1, Suite 110,  Austin, Texas   78754 or email <a href="mailto:support@callawaygolfpreowned.com">support@callawaygolfpreowned.com</a>.   We will provide you with a readable copy of the Personal Information within a  reasonable time period after your request (usually 30 days, although we will  acknowledge your request within 14 days). You may challenge the data that we  hold about you, and, where appropriate, you may have the data corrected or  completed. In some instances recognized by law, we may refuse to provide you  with a copy of the Personal Information or change the data, but we will give  you reasons for our refusal. </p>

<p>We also may offer links to websites that are not operated by Callaway  Golf. If you visit one of these linked sites, you should review their privacy  and other policies. We are not responsible for the policies and practices of  other companies. Similarly, while all websites operated by the Callaway Golf  Companies have similar privacy policies that govern their use and operation,  policies may vary from site to site based upon local customs, practices or laws  or due to circumstances unique to that site.

<p>Any Personal Information that Callaway Golf receives from third parties  is subject to the privacy polices of those entities. We are not responsible for  the policies and practices of other companies. You should carefully review the  privacy policy of any third party to make sure you are comfortable with how  they are going to treat your personal data. For example, some companies may  require you to opt-out of their information exchange programs. In those  instances, Callaway Golf may receive and/or use information gathered by these  outside companies or agencies, and the handling and processing of your data  will be governed by such third parties’ policies and not by this Callaway Golf  policy.</p>
