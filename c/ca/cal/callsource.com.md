This type of information is only collected from you voluntarily; we will never gather or store such information without your knowledge and consent. Examples of where we might gather such information from you: when you sign up to receive e-mail updates or newsletters about the site, our products, or services; to allow you to register or update your individual profile on the site; to help personalize the site for you; or to allow you to provide feedback, or ask a question. In some situations, you will need to provide some or all of the above-described personally identifiable information in order for certain personalized features of the site to function properly (e.g., accessing the partner program portals).

When you provide such information for a specific purpose, such as receiving product alerts, we will use such information to contact you solely for that purpose, except that we may at times also contact you to provide you with critical site information that impacts the features, product information, or services you have requested.

We do not share personally identifiable information collected at this site with third parties, except for the limited instances noted below. The exceptions are:

  * We may also disclose personally identifiable information if we are required to comply with laws, or if in our good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to any claims, or to protect the rights of _CallSource_ ®, its customers and the public.
  * In the event of an acquisition of all or part of _CallSource_ ® by another company, or in the event that _CallSource_ ® were to sell or dispose of all or a part of the _CallSource_ ® business, the acquirer would have access to the information maintained by _CallSource_ ®, which could include personally identifiable information, subject to applicable law. Similarly, information may be transferred as part of a reorganization or insolvency proceeding.
