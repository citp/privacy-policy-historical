    <h3>1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p class="maintext">
        <b><i>Caliber Home Loans, Inc.</i></b> and its affiliates (collectively "<b><i>Caliber Home Loans</i></b>" or "we") 
        will treat personal data that you provide through this web site or any related web sites (collectively the "Site") 
        according to this privacy policy (this "Policy"), which is consistent with our treatment of personal data that you 
        provide offline to us or to our brokers and dealers. By visiting the Site, you agree to be bound by this Policy. 
    </p>
    <h3>2. FOREIGN VISITORS</h3>
    <p class="maintext">
        If you are visiting the Site from outside the United States, please do not provide any personal data through the 
        Site or by e-mail, as this Policy may not comply with local laws in your jurisdiction. 
    </p>
    <h3>3. CHILDREN</h3>
    <p class="maintext">
        This Site is not intended for visitors under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal data 
        from or about people under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly market our products or services to people under 18 
        years of age. 
    </p>
    <h3>4. PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT FROM VISITORS</h3>
    <p class="maintext">
        Personal data identifies an individual by, for example, name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. We may 
        collect the following types of personal data: (1) if you apply for a job, your name, address, references, and 
        employment history; (2) if you apply for credit, your name, address, social security number, credit history, and 
        financial information, directly or through one of our brokers or dealers; (3) if you use this site to check the 
        status of your account, your name, account number, and other information, such as a password, to verify your 
        identity; and (4) if you send us e-mail or request information, your name, email address, and any other personal 
        data you supply in your e-mail message. 
    </p>
    <h3>5. OTHER DATA WE AUTOMATICALLY COLLECT</h3>
    <p class="maintext">
        When you visit the Site, <b><i>Caliber Home Loans</i></b> collects certain non-personal data by various means, one 
        of which is "cookies." A cookie is an alphanumeric string of text (a unique identifier) that our web-server stores 
        in your computer by means of your web-browser. The cookie allows us to recognize your computer when you revisit the 
        Site. We can then improve your use of the Site, for example by providing quick log-in, displaying only web pages 
        that interest you, and saving you from retyping information in a form. Cookies also allow us to analyze aggregate 
        traffic on the Site, in order to streamline navigation and keep the content fresh for all visitors. You can configure 
        your browser to reject cookies, but doing so may disable some of the Site's features. Cookies do not contain personal 
        data, nor can they read or transmit any data on your computer's hard drive. They can, nonetheless, be combined with 
        personal data that you knowingly provide, to create a profile.  <b><i>Caliber Home Loans</i></b> does not use cookies 
        in this manner without your express consent.<br><br>
        Regardless of cookies, all web-browsers transmit the IP address of the computer on which they are running (so that 
        the web-server knows where to send the requested web page). We analyze IP addresses only in extraordinary circumstances 
        to attempt to track hackers. 
    </p>
    <h3>6. HOW WE USE THE DATA WE COLLECT</h3>
    <p class="maintext">
        We may use the data that you provide as follows: (1) if you apply for a job, to consider you for the position and to 
        contact references; (2) if you apply for credit, to assess your credit-worthiness (including retrieving credit reports) 
        and to approve or reject your application; (3) if you check the status of your account, to respond to your inquiry; 
        (4) if you send us e-mail or request information, to reply to your request. We may also use the data that you provide 
        to help us improve the content and function of the Site or other sites, to better understand our customers and markets, 
        to improve our products and services, to enhance our marketing and promotional efforts, to improve product offerings, 
        and to later contact you, electronically or otherwise, about products or services that we believe will interest you. 
        If required by law, such communications will explain how to "opt out" of receiving future communications. You cannot, 
        however, opt out of receiving communications about your account, such as service announcements and administrative notices. 
    </p>

        <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Affiliates</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. We may share your name, address, and information about your transactions and experiences 
        with us (such as your payment history or other facts about your account) with our affiliates.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We may also share other personal data that you provide with our affiliates in order to 
        provide you with information about products or services that may interest you.<br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>b.  Agents and Service Providers -</b> In order to establish, administer, and manage our customers' accounts, 
        evaluate credit, provide customer service and benefits, process account transactions and account statements, conduct research 
        and analysis, or process job applications, we may disclose personal data to companies that work with us to perform services 
        or business operations on our behalf. We may also share personal data with companies that perform marketing services on our 
        behalf, or with other financial institutions (including insurance companies) with whom we have joint marketing 
        agreements.<br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>c.  Third Parties (Disclosures Permitted or Required by Law)</b> - In certain instances, we are permitted or 
        even required to disclose your personal data to third parties. Examples of this type of permitted disclosure are reporting 
        information about your transactions with us to credit reporting agencies, responding to regulators or auditors, protecting 
        against fraud, or providing information in connection with proposed or actual business transactions involving our companies 
        or accounts. We may also disclose your personal data to third parties when legally compelled to do so, or when we believe 
        that such disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce our terms of use, or to protect the rights, property, 
        or safety of <b><i>Caliber Home Loans</i></b>, its employees, customers, visitors to the Site, and others. Please be aware 
        that these disclosures are permitted by law without your consent.<br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>d.  Business Transfers</b>- As we develop our business, we may sell or buy businesses or assets, or be 
        involved in mergers or other corporate reorganization. In transactions such as these, your personal data may be one of 
        the transferred business assets.<br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>e.  Other Third Parties (Optional Disclosures)</b>- We may share, as permitted by law, your personal data 
        with third parties with whom we do not have joint marketing agreements, such as other financial service providers, insurance 
        companies, or non-financial companies such as service organizations, retailers, travel services or direct marketers. These 
        companies may wish to provide you with information about products or services that may interest you.<br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Option for our Consumer Customers</b>: If you are a consumer (as opposed to commercial) 
        customer of <b><i>Caliber Home Loans</i></b>, you may direct us not to share personal data with other third parties, except 
        as permitted by law, by sending an e-mail to 
        <a href="mailto:US.Privacy@CaliberHomeLoans.com" target="_top">US.Privacy@CaliberHomeLoans.com</a>.
