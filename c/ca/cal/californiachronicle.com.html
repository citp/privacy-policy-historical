           PRIVACY POLICY</b></font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Your 
                privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of 
           our operations, we gather certain types of information about 
           our users. This 
                Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") explains the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how you may correct or change information that 
           we may collect.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>
           Information Collected</b><br>
                     We collect two types of information about users: personal information (such as name and e-mail address) and aggregate information (such as 
                     information about how many users log on to our sites on a daily basis).</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Personal Information</b><br>
                     Personal information is collected when users voluntarily register for membership services 
           or sign up as authors. These services include receiving electronic newsletters, creating personal stock 
                     portfolios, using community and communication services, answering surveys, purchasing items, and entering contests and other promotional opportunities provided on our 
                     sites. We may collect personal information from you in other areas of our sites, but we will provide on-screen notification that we are doing so. We may receive personal 
                     usage and demographic information from our third-party partners, and we also collect e-mail addresses from users who send us support mail or request technical or other 
                     help. This information enables us to improve our sites to make your online visits more productive and enjoyable.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Aggregate Information</b><br>
                     One method of collecting aggregate information about your activities online (such as the pages you access most frequently or the search terms you enter), and information 
                     volunteered by you (such as survey or registration information), is by tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned 
                     to your computer whenever you surf the Web. The computers that deliver the Web pages to you automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page 
                     from one of our sites, our servers log your IP address.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our sites record IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and 
                     to provide aggregate data to advertisers about the volume of use on our sites. We also create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers 
                     and partners. This allows these parties to advertise more effectively, and allows you to receive advertisements that are most relevant to your personal interests. An 
                     advertiser will not know that you clicked its advertisement unless you voluntarily and explicitly permit us to provide such information.</font><br><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Search Terms</b><br>
                     As a measure of user interest, we track search terms that are entered into our sites' search features. Search data and user-provided information help to improve the 
                     relevancy of search results by learning user preferences and prioritizing search results accordingly. The intended result is a more efficient search feature for visitors 
                     to our sites.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
                     Our sites use 'cookies' to record information. A cookie is a small data file that Web sites store on your hard drive when you visit them. Cookies allow us to measure 
                     activity on our sites and to improve your user experience by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, and allowing you to visit various members-only parts of 
                     our sites without re-registering. Cookies allow us to determine which areas and features of our sites are most popular by measuring user activity. This information allows 
                     us to make improvements and updates to improve your California Chronicle experience. Our sites do not use cookies to retrieve any information from your computer.</font><br> </p><p>
                     <font face="Verdana" size="2">Most browsers are set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you may set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being 
                     sent. However, some parts of our sites, such as the members-only areas (i.e. shopping, contest and game areas) will not function properly if you choose not to accept 
                     cookies.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
           You may occasionally get cookies from our 
           advertisers. We do not control these cookies, and they 
                     are not subject to our Privacy Policy.</font><br><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>
           Use of Information Collected</b><br>
                     We use the personal information we collect to improve the content of our sites; to customize the content and/or layout of our sites for each 
                     individual user; to notify users about updates to our sites or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to users; and to investigate 
                     violations of our terms and conditions of use.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Sharing Data with  Affiliates</b><br>
                     We may share the personal and aggregate information we collect with our affiliates and other sites operated by or for 
           Ultio LLC.</font><br> </p><p>
                     <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Sharing Data with Third Parties</b><br>
                     Our organization shares aggregate information with third parties for advertising and promotional purposes. With user permission, 
                     we access personal information on behalf 
                     of pre-screened third parties for 
                     marketing or promotional purposes. We 
                     will always request permission to share 
                     such information on our sites. You may 
                     elect not to participate by clicking the 
                     appropriate on-screen button. We may also share personal information with consultants and 
                     affiliates for internal business purposes and may divulge personal information if such information is subpoenaed, or if 
                     we believe that membership 
                     has been used to commit unlawful acts, or acts that may endanger the health or safety of another user or of the general public. In some situations, we will share your 
                     personal information, on a confidential basis, with third parties who perform a particular service on our behalf, such as sending e-mails. These parties are not allowed to 
                     use personal information except for the limited purpose of providing the particular service on our behalf. In addition, 
                     we receive personal usage 
                     and demographic information from third parties and uses this information to improve our products and services.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Occasionally, we may 
                     post the name of a user (for example, a contest winner) on one of our sites. 
           We will notify you of this possibility when you provide your information 
                     or, if possible, will notify you when the information is posted.</font><br> </p><p>
           <font face="Verdana" size="2">We use a third-party 
           advertising company to serve ads when you visit our 
           sites. This company may use information (not 
           including your name, address, e-mail address or 
           telephone number) about your visits to our and 
           other Web sites in order to provide advertisements 
           on this site and other sites about goods and 
           services of interest to you. In addition, we share 
           Web site usage information about visitors to our 
           sites with such company for the purpose of managing 
           and targeting advertisements on our sites. For this 
           purpose, we and our third-party advertising company 
           note some of the pages you visit on our sites 
           through the use of pixel tags (also called clear 
           gifs).</font><br><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>
                     Membership Services and Service Providers</b><br>
                     When you register to use membership services, 
           we may share your registration information with content or service providers. For instance, the 
                     personal information that you provide to our e-mail, sports, discussion boards and gaming services is shared with the companies that provide those services in order to 
                     retrieve your password when necessary. You do not have to register your personal information with our sites, but if you choose not to, certain services, such as e-mail and 
                     sports, will not be available to you.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Electronic Newsletters</b><br>
                     Some of our sites offer free, electronic newsletters as a service to our users. You will only receive a newsletter if you agree to receive it during registration to one of 
                     the areas of our sites or directly from our newsletter sign-up form. We will not divulge your membership in a newsletter mailing list to any third parties, including 
                     advertisers or partners, if you request that we not do so when you register.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you have registered through our online registration 
                     system and have subscribed to one or more of 
           our e-mail newsletters but do not want to continue receiving such e-mail newsletter(s), 
           please deactivate your subscription.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Shopping</b><br>
                     Our shopping services allow you to search merchant sites and make online purchases through our affiliated site,
                     <a href="http://www.reliablelinks.com">ReliableLinks.com</a>. These purchases may require credit card and personal contact information. The ReliableLinks's shopping 
                     services store your information and send it to the merchant automatically when you make your purchase, using encryption technology to protect your information during this 
                     transfer.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We strive to make your shopping experience as worry-free as possible. We use secure server software (SSL), the industry 
                     standard for ensuring the security of your electronic commerce transactions. SSL encrypts all of your personal information transmitted over the Internet, including your 
                     credit card number and name and address. This technology is designed to protect your information by rendering it useless, should it ever be intercepted in transit. We will 
                     continue to provide the highest level of security by implementing improved technologies as they become available.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Note that each of 
                     our online merchants follows separate privacy policies. 
           Ultio LLC is not responsible for policies other than our own. For more information about a 
                     merchant's policy, visit the merchant's home page and read carefully its privacy policy.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>CHILDREN AND PRIVACY</b><br>
                     We encourage parents and guardians to spend time with their children online, and to be familiar with the sites their children visit. At various 
                     places on our sites, we ask whether users are under the age of 18 or 13. 
           We rely on our users to be truthful in responding to these questions.</font><br>
                </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Individuals Under 13</b><br>
                     No information should be submitted to or posted on our sites by users under the age of 13. Individuals under the age of 13 are not allowed to become registered users of 
                     our sites.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Individuals 13 Through 17</b><br>
                     We request that children under the age of 18 not submit or post information to our sites. If an individual between the ages of 13 and 17 does so, 
                     we may collect information (including personally identifying information). This information may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by 
           Ultio LLC or one of our affiliated sites and may, with the user's permission, be shared with pre-screened third parties. If a user or his/her parent or guardian changes his/her mind with 
                     respect to such use, that user, parent or guardian may stop that use either by e-mail request or by modifying his/her registration information online.</font><br> </p><p>
                     <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Community and Public Areas</b><br>
                     Information posted to message boards, chat areas, clubs and home pages is available to the general public. Please use caution when posting any such information. Users 
                     under the age of 18 should be particularly careful not to provide any personally identifying information while using chat rooms or message boards. Users of chat areas and 
                     message boards must follow acceptable standards of behavior when posting messages online. 
                     We reserve the right to, but are not obligated to, refuse

                     information and use it in a way inconsistent with 
           our privacy policy. We do not control the content that appears on these
