        <p>
            <strong>The Information We Collect.</strong><br>
            At California Psychics<sup>®</sup> you can do a variety of things! You may be
            able to talk to a psychic, enter contests, participate in surveys, subscribe to
            a service (like our horoscopes), take quizzes, post to message boards, or participate
            in a chat room. When you visit CaliforniaPsychics.com we collect your IP address
            and standard web log information, such as your browser type and the pages you accessed
            on our website. The types of personally identifiable information (i.e. information
            that can directly identify you or indicate where you might be contacted) that may
            be collected at these pages includes: name, address, age, date of birth, sex, e-mail
            address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information
            about your interests in and use of various services. You can view or change your

                    info@californiapsychics.com</a>.</p>
        <p>
            We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information (i.e. generic
            information that does not identify you personally) when you visit any of our web
            pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari,
            Firefox), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows or Mac) and
            the domain name of your Internet service provider.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How We Use and Disclose the Information.</strong><br>
            We will use the personal information you provide online for the purpose(s) you have
            submitted. Examples of us using your personal information for the purpose(s) submitted
            include if you sign up for horoscopes, we will send to an e-mail with your horoscope
            for the day or, if you have won a contest, sending to you an email notification
            that you have won. In addition, we may send to you an e-mail offering products or
            services which we think you may be interested in or to ask you to participate in
            a survey. If you want us to stop using the personal information you provided in
            these ways, please contact us at info@californiaspsychics.com.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How We Share Your Personal Information.</strong><br>
            We will not share the personal information you provide except (a) if it is for the
            purpose(s) you provided it; (b) with your consent; (c) as may be required by law
            or as we think necessary to protect our company or others from injury (for example,
            in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency
            request, when we believe that someone is causing (or about to cause) injury to or
            interference with the rights or property of another, or when we believe that someone
            has violated our Terms and Conditions); (d) with other persons or companies with
            whom we contract to carry out internal site operations or our business activities
            (for example, third party contractors - see below); and/or (e) notifying you when
            we make changes to one of our subscriber agreements or this policy. As we continue
            to develop our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries, or business units. In
            such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business
            assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy
            (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the event that Outlook
            Amusements, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information
            will of course be one of the transferred assets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our business needs may change from time to time and we reserve the right to make
            changes to our Privacy Policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy
            applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We will not
            materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer
            information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.</p>
        <p>
            If intended uses differ from this Policy, we will seek to obtain your consent at
            the place where the information is collected either by an "opt-in" or "opt-out"
            method, or by other means (such as sending to you an e-mail).
        </p>
        <p>
            Our operations and maintenance contractors sometimes have limited access to your
            personally identifiable information in the course of providing products or services
            to Outlook Amusements, Inc. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that
            provide us with credit card processing, e-mail distribution technology, services,
            and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our Web site. Access to your
            personally identifiable information by these contractors is limited to the information
            reasonably necessary for the contractor to perform its limited function for Outlook
            Amusements, Inc. We also contractually require that our operations and maintenance
            contractors 1) protect the privacy of your personally identifiable information consistent
            with this Privacy Policy, and 2) not use or disclose your personally identifiable
            information for any purpose other than providing us with products and services as
            required by law.
        </p>
        <p>
            CaliforniaPsychics.com<sup>®</sup> is committed to handling your customer information
            with high standards of information security. We are VeriSign secured and we maintain
            physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations
            to guard your nonpublic personal information.

            <strong>Our Psychics/Your Privacy</strong><br>
            <strong>Note that our psychics are independent contractors and not employed directly
                by Outlook Amusements, Inc. We contractually require that our psychics protect the
                privacy of your personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy and not
                use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than providing you
                with the services you request through the Web site or by phone. You should also
                take care to protect your personal information and privacy. There is no reason that
                you should provide any of our psychics with personal contact information, specific
                financial information including but not limited to account numbers, or other confidential
                information related to your identity. It is a violation of our <a href="terms_of_Service.aspx">
                    Terms of Use</a> for you to be in direct contact with any of our psychics outside
                the online service – if you do so, Outlook Amusements, Inc. bears no liability
                for any resulting actions, and your ability to use our services may be revoked.</strong></p>
        <p>
            <strong>Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Information.</strong>
            <br>
            We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to
            improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your
            Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze
            how our site is used, as well as to offer you products, programs or services. We
            may also share aggregate information with others, including affiliated companies
            and non-affiliated companies.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Collection of Information by Others.</strong><br>
            Our site may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different
            than ours. You should check the other sites' privacy notices since we have no control
            over information that is submitted to or collected by them.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Cookies.</strong><br>
            To enhance your online experience with us, many of our web pages use "cookies."
            Cookies are text files placed on your hard disk by our web server to store your
            preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other
            personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information
            to us. However, once you choose to provide the personally identifiable information,
            this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. Cookies cannot
            be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.</p>
        <p>
            We use cookies as a convenience feature to save you time, to understand how our
            site is used, and to improve the content and offerings on our site. For example,
            we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages or recall your
            specific information on subsequent visits (e.g. to recognize you by name when you
            return to our site). You can opt to have your browser reject cookies without any
            effect on your use of our site. If you do that, you may need to re-register with
            us every time you visit our site in order to participate in certain promotions.
            You should also know that companies that advertise on our web site (and their agents)
            might use their own cookies. This policy does not cover how these companies use
            their cookies.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Web Beacons.</strong><br>
            Some of our Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons, which
            are also called single-pixel gifs. These images allow us to count users who have
            visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used
            to access your personally identifiable information but they are a technique we use
            to compile aggregated statistics about our website usage. Web beacons collect only
            a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page
            view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. Some of our
            Web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there to help us determine the effectiveness
            of our advertising campaigns.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Clickstream Data.</strong><br>
            As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site
            you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream
            data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream data
            can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of
            the web site from which you linked to CaliforniaPsychics.com<sup>®</sup>. We
            may use clickstream data as a form of non-personally identifiable information to
            anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of CaliforniaPsychics.com<sup>®</sup>,

        <strong>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS </strong>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            Outlook Amusements, Inc. collects various types of personal information about you,
            both online and offline, during the course of our business relationship. Under California
            law, if you are a resident of California, you may make a written request to Outlook
            Amusements, Inc. for information about how we have shared your personal information
            with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the prior calendar
            year, as well as a list of categories of information shared. For purposes of this
            California Privacy Rights notice, third parties include companies within our “family”
            of companies, such as those companies we own, that own us, or under common control
            with us.</p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            Under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if
            the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its <a href="#top">Privacy Policy</a>)
            a policy of not disclosing customer personal information to third parties for their
            direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the
            disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather,
            the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right
            to prevent disclosure of personal information and by providing a cost-free means
            to exercise that right.</p>
        <p>
            As stated in our <a href="#top">Privacy Policy</a>, we do not share information
            with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively
            agree to such disclosure -- typically by opting in to receive information from a
            third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of
            our sites. If you do ask us to share your information with a third party for its
            marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific
            promotion, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual basis.
            To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by
            a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personally identifiable
            information on one of our sites. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive
            future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the
            third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third
            party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly,
            as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always
            review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine
            how that entity will handle your information.</p>
        <p>
            California customers may request further information about our compliance with this
            law by e-mailing <a href="mailto:info@californiapsychics.com">info@californiapsychics.com</a>.
            Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each
            year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through
            this e-mail address.</p>
