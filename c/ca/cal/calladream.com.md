### Security

www.Calladream.com takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the Secure Socket Layers (SSLs) encryption software. SSL encrypts your own information, so only we are able to decode the information. 

However, security systems are not infallible, including encryption systems. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

We ask all our customers to take measures to help protect information in their online accounts, including the following:

Install the latest security updates and anti-virus software on your computer to help prevent malware and viruses.

Reset your e-mail account passwords frequently.

Use complex passwords (a minimum of 6 alpha/numeric letters).

Do not use the same password on more than one website.

Do not share your password with others.

If you receive an e-mail that looks like it is from us asking you for private information, do not respond. Cause we will never request your password, credit card information or other information through e-mail

We reserve the right to change this privacy policy, and any of our policies or procedures concerning the treatment of information collected through the site, without prior notice. Any changes to our privacy policy will become effective upon posting of the revised policy on the Internet, accessible through the site. Use of the site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy then in effect.
