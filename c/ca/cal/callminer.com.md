# PrivacyStatement

Please feel free to contact the webmaster with any questions, comments, or problems that might arise. INFORMATION CALLMINER COLLECTS: The type of information we maintain on our secure Personal Information server falls into two categories. The first is general information about you such as name, billing address, e-mail address, company name, etc. The second is product-specific information that enables us to customize information for you depending on which of our products or services you have purchased or registered. Our Technical Support department also utilizes this information when you contact it. COOKIES: "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. They only contain a secure identifying code that we use to match you to your Personal Information whenever you return to our site. Your Personal Information is never directly connected to nor stored on your computer, but is accessed when we identify your cookie to provide you with a more personalized experience when visiting our site. ONLINE REGISTRATION: When you register a product, whether purchased online directly from CallMiner or otherwise, we store the Personal Information you give us on a secure server. That information is treated in the same manner as any Personal Information. In some countries, CallMiner is represented by an exclusive reseller who provides marketing, sales, and support services on behalf of CallMiner in the interest of providing better service to customers residing in that country. When you submit your Personal Information to CallMiner, you understand and agree that if you reside in a country where an Exclusive Reseller represents CallMiner, CallMiner may forward your customer profile to that Reseller. Your personal information will not be leased, sold, rented or otherwise made available to any other third party except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws, police investigations, or in legal proceedings where such information is relevant. c) To allow us to inform you of product updates and upgrades, special offers, new services and products, as well as updated information that may be made available to registered users. You take online privacy seriously, and so does CallMiner, Inc. It's our way of sustaining your trust in CallMiner, Inc. as well as in our products and services. NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION: In general, you can visit CallMiner on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. PERSONAL INFORMATION: CallMiner.com may ask you to register and provide information that personally identifies you, such as name, e-mail address, mailing address or phone number ("Personal Information"). This will occur in certain circumstances, including for example, when you download trial software or purchase software among others. We use your Personal Information for three primary purposes: a) To enable you to find or gain access to information, software or services on our web site. CallMiner, Inc. ("CallMiner") will not provide your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, or any other Personal Information to any third parties except for Authorized Resellers. We may, from time to time, select other companies with pertinent information or products we think might be appropriate for you, and send you that information on behalf of that third party. To accomplish that, we would not disclose your Personal Information to them. If you do not desire us to send you information on third party products, please let us know by sending us e-mail with your Personal Information. Similarly, if you don't want CallMiner to send you e-mail or postal mail regarding CallMiner’s products, services, or special offers, let us know by sending us an e-mail to sales@callminer.com. [**_Home_**](https://web.archive.org/web/20040602195347id_/http%3A//www.callminer.com/Main.aspx) b) To register your license and rights, if any, to technical support.
