## Privacy Policy

Calligraphr.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

Certain visitors to Calligraphr.com's websites choose to interact with Calligraphr.com in ways that require Calligraphr.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Calligraphr.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with Calligraphr.com by purchasing an upgrade are asked to provide additional information, including financial information required to process those transactions. However, Calligraphr.com does not store any such information.
