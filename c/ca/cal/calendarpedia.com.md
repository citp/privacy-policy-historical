This page outlines the types of personal information we receive and collect when you use Calendarpedia.com, how we use it, and the steps we take to safeguard and protect this information. We hope this will enable you to make an informed decision about sharing personal information with us. Calendarpedia.com strives to maintain the highest standards of decency, fairness and integrity in all our operations. Likewise, we are dedicated to protecting our visitors' privacy on our website. If you have any questions about this or any other issue, please [contact us](http://www.calendarpedia.com/contact.html).

**Personal Information**  
Calendarpedia.com collects personally identifiable information from visitors to this website only on a voluntary basis and only when a visitor [contacts us](http://www.calendarpedia.com/contact.html) via the contact form or by e-mail. The only personal information collected in the contact form is your name and e-mail address. Both of these pieces of information are voluntary, and you're not required to enter this information into the contact form in order to contact us (however, if you would like us to be able to reply to you, please give us your e-mail address). Calendarpedia.com will use personal information received from you for internal purposes only and will _never_ sell, rent, distribute, provide or give your information to any third party, nor will it be used in any way other than to respond to your enquiry and/or notify you of updates to Calendarpedia.com relating to your enquiry. We also collect each visitor's IP address, which helps us combat spam and fraud. We do not use IP addresses for any other purpose.

Any personally identifiable information that we may collect from you is held securely to prevent any unauthorised access and/or disclosure to third parties.

If we make material changes in the collection of personally identifiable information, we will inform you by placing a notice on our site.

If you have provided us with personal information and would like to update or correct that information, or have the information we hold on you deleted from our records, please [contact us](http://www.calendarpedia.com/contact.html).

**Non-personal Information**  
We collect information about you that is not personally identifiable, such as web server data and your IP address. We use this information to track the movements of visitors around the site, to analyse trends, to administer and improve the site, and to understand how our users as a group use the services and resources provided on our site. Non-personally identifiable information may include the browser name, the type of computer, and technical information about your method of connecting to our site, such as the operating system and the Internet service provider you used, and other similar information.

This information is used solely by us and is not shared or passed on in any way.

**Use of Cookies and Web Beacons**  
We use cookies to help you personalize your online experience. Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize the site's pages, a cookie enables Calendarpedia.com to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.

Cookies are used on nearly all web sites. All web sites in the European Union that use cookies are legally obliged to inform about their use of cookies in a document such as this.

You can delete cookies stored on your computer at any time. Please visit [aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-delete-cookies/) for more information.

A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor your journey around a single website or collection of sites. They are also referred to as web bugs and are commonly used by sites that hire third-party services to monitor traffic. They may be used in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with the pages and content on the pages of a website.

Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be used to override web beacons. Taking either of these actions shouldn't cause a problem with your access to and use of Calendarpedia.com.

In the course of ads being served on our website, we may serve third-party advertisements that use cookies and web beacons in order to ascertain how many times you've seen a particular advertisement.
