This notice will govern our Privacy Policy for users of   this or any other Calora Media website, whether or not a transaction of   any sort is conducted while visiting.</p>
              <p><strong>Your Personal Information</strong></p>
            <p>The   information we learn from customers helps us to personalize and   continually improve our customer service, while developing ways to   improve your experience at Calora. Following is some of the information   we gather about our users.&nbsp;</p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li><strong>Information You Provide Us</strong>:   When you complete a Customer Profile or other form online or   communicate with us via e-mail, letter, fax or phone, we receive and   store the information you've provided. This information is basic,   including: name, addresses, phone, fax and cell phone numbers, e-mail   address, interests and business information (if applicable). We use this   information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your   requests, communicating with you and customizing future services for   you.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li><strong>Third Party Vendors:</strong>   In addition to collecting your information, we have third party vendors   who will also collect your information in order to provide the products   and/or services you've requested (e.g. credit card companies or banks,   fulfilment companies, call centres, suppliers, affiliates and marketing   companies). In general, these companies are intermediaries acting solely   to provide services related to your request. Most of these vendors have   their own privacy policy to protect your information, and have access   to personal information needed to perform their functions on behalf of   Calora Media, but may not use the same for other purposes.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul type="disc">

Google will use this information for the   purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on   website activity for website operators and providing other services   relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also   transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by   law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's   behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data   held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the   appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do   this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.   By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you   by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above. </p>
            <p><strong>Information from Other Sources:</strong>   We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to   our account information. Examples may include, but not be limited to,   updated delivery and address information from our carriers or other   third parties, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next   purchase or communication more easily; account information, purchase or   redemption information, and page-view information from some merchants   with which we operate co-branded businesses or for which we provide   technical, fulfilment, advertising, or other services; search term and   search result information from some searches conducted through the Web   search features offered by certain organizations; search results and   links, including paid listings (such as Sponsored Links); and credit   history information from credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent   and detect fraud and to offer certain credit or financial services to   some customers, and information from data providers.</p>
            <p><strong>Does Calora Share the Information It Receives?</strong></p>
            <p>Simply   said, no. Under no circumstances will we ever give away or sell your   personal information to anyone else for any reason whatsoever, without   prior written approval from yourself. Any information we gain through   our use of customer polls, surveys, cookies, session tracking or   anything else, is used internally and for the sole purpose of providing   you better service. If you are on our mailing list and you ask us to   remove you, we will immediately and will not attempt to sell on your   information. As we do with our own, we respect your privacy.</p>
            <p>Information   about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are   not in the business of selling it to other companies. We share customer   information only as described in this statement and with subsidiaries of   Calora Media with controls that are either subject to this Privacy   Notice or follow the practice at least as protective as that described   in this Notice.</p>
            <p><strong>How Secure Is Information About Me?</strong></p>
            <p>All   of our employees and partners are familiar with our security policy and   practices. Your personal information is only accessible to a limited   number of qualified people who are given a password in order to gain   access to the information. We audit our security systems and processes   on a regular basis. Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers   or social security numbers, is protected by encryption protocols, in   place to protect information sent over the Internet.</p>
            <p>While   we take commercially reasonable measures to maintain a secure site,   electronic communications and databases are subject to errors, tampering   and break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or warrant that such events will   not take place and we will not be liable for any such occurrences. You   will find that almost all Internet e-commerce providers make this same   claim, especially if they use privacy policy templates such as this one   to make known their company or organization privacy policies.</p>
            <p>We   reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when   confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card   number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.   Protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your   computer by signing off when you finish using a computer.</p>
            <p><strong>What Choices Do I Have?</strong></p>
            <p>As   discussed above, you always have the choice not to provide information,   even though it might be needed to make a purchase with Calora. You can   add or update certain information on your Personal Calora pages at any   time. If you do not want to receive e-mails or other mail from us,   simply click the Preferences link at the footer of any email sent by   Calora Media and you will be removed from our mailing list. To remove   other personal information from Calora Media, please contact our   offices. Please note that you cannot opt-out of communication pertaining   to services such as making a purchase on Calora Media.</p>
            <p><strong>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</strong></p>
            <p>If   you choose to visit Calora, your visit and any dispute over privacy is   subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations   on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the laws of the   Republic of South Africa. If you have any concern about privacy at our   site, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to   resolve it.</p>
            <p>Because our   business changes constantly, our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of   Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices   and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should   check our Web Site frequently to see recent changes.</p>
            <p>Unless   stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information   that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises   we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and   practices to make them less protective of customer information collected   in the past without the consent of affected customers.</p>
            <p>Calora   Media features public forums where users with similar interests can   share information and support one another or where users can post   questions. Our communities are open to the public and should not be   considered private.<br>
              Any information you share in any online community   area is by design open to the public and is not private. You should   think carefully before posting any personal information in any public   forum. What you post can be seen, disclosed to or collected by third   parties and may be used by others in ways we cannot control or predict,   including to contact you for unauthorized purposes. As with any public   forum on any site, the information you post may also show up in   third-party search engines like Google, Yahoo, MSN, Bing etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Consumer Protection Act (CPA)</strong></p>
            <p>South   African CPA laws shall supersede any Calora Media terms and conditions   which conflict with the act or any other laws in the Republic of South   Africa. </p>
