<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>Although you may generally use our site without providing us with any personally identifiable information, for some site applications or services, we may collect certain types of personally identifiable information, including: name, postal address, e-mail addresses, and phone number. This type of information is only collected from you voluntarily; we will never gather or store such information without your knowledge and consent. Examples of where we might gather such information from you: when you sign up to receive e-mail updates or newsletters about the site, our products, or services; to allow you to register or update your individual profile on the site; to help personalize the site for you; or to allow you to provide feedback, or ask a question. In some situations, you will need to provide some or all of the above-described personally identifiable information in order for certain personalized features of the site to function properly (e.g., accessing the partner program portals).</p>
<p>When you provide such information for a specific purpose, such as receiving product alerts, we will use such information to contact you solely for that purpose, except that we may at times also contact you to provide you with critical site information that impacts the features, product information, or services you have requested.</p>
<p>We do not share personally identifiable information collected at this site with third parties, except for the limited instances noted below. The exceptions are:</p>
<ul><li>We may share your information with our agents who assist us in administering the site and various programs and promotions. They can only use the information to administer our site, services, and products. These agents are required to keep your information private and secure.</li>
<li>If you opt-in (either at the time of providing personally identifiable information, or at a later time) to have us share your information with our partners for the purpose of receiving information from our partners and other companies.</li>
<li>We may also disclose personally identifiable information if we are required to comply with laws, or if in our good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to any claims, or to protect the rights of CallSource®, its customers and the public.</li>
<li>In the event of an acquisition of all or part of CallSource® by another company, or in the event that CallSource® were to sell or dispose of all or a part of the CallSource® business, the acquirer would have access to the information maintained by CallSource®, which could include personally identifiable information, subject to applicable law. Similarly, information may be transferred as part of a reorganization or insolvency proceeding.</li>
</ul><p>We may on occasion combine information we receive with outside records or site usage information to enhance our consumer profiles for our own marketing and development purposes (in accordance with this Privacy Policy).</p>
<h3>Cookie/Tracking Technology</h3>
<p>This site may use cookie and tracking technology. A "Cookie," is a tiny file that your browser places on your computer's hard drive, which acts to identify your computer. Cookie and cookie tracking technology is useful for gathering information such as browser type and operating system, tracking the number of visitors to the site, and understanding how visitors use the site. Cookies can also help tailor the site to visitors' needs and help customize the site for visitors. For example, we may use cookies to store your site preferences, usage patterns, and other information so that the site will function better for you on subsequent visits. The site may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and for other similar purposes. Personally identifiable information cannot be collected via cookies and other tracking technology; however, if you previously provided personally identifiable information (as discussed above), cookies may be tied to such information. Aggregated cookie and tracking information may be shared with third parties. If you choose to reject the site's cookies, some areas of the site may not function properly or may not be accessible.</p>
<h3>Automatically Collected Log Information</h3>
<p>In addition to the information discussed above, when you visit the site we may collect and store the following information in our logs for each browser request. We may use such information for development and marketing purposes (we will not use IP addresses externally except as set forth above)</p>
<ul><li>the date and time</li>
<li>the originating IP address</li>
<li>the type of browser and operating system used (if provided by the browser)</li>
<li>the URL of the referring page (if provided by the browser)</li>
<li>the object requested</li>
<li>completion status of the request</li>
<li>pages visited</li>

<h3>Demographic Information and Surveys and Polls</h3>
<p>We may ask for demographic or profile (age, gender, household, interests, etc.) information in a survey/poll or at registration. This information is used to assist us in tailoring the site, our communications, and our services and products to visitors and consumers. We may share aggregated demographic and survey information, as opposed to individual information, with third parties.

If you have any questions regarding security you can contact us at http://www.callsource.com/home/contact/.</p>
<p>If you have signed up to participate in our partner programs or receive newsletters and email from us, we will make every effort to have all such communications allow you to opt-out of further such communications.
