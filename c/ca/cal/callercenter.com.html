  CallerCenter, Inc. (“<strong>CallerCenter</strong>”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of the CallerCenter website located at http://callercenter.com (the “<strong>Site</strong>”) and any services or software offered by CallerCenter (including but not limited to our CallerCenter Mobile App) (any and all of the foregoing the “<strong>CallerCenter Service</strong>” or “<strong>CallerCenter</strong>”).&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies only to information provided to us by users through CallerCenter.<br>
  This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.&nbsp; We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site or via the CallerCenter Mobile App.&nbsp; You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes.<br>
  As used herein, the term “<strong>Non Registered User</strong>” means an individual who has (i) submitted his or her Caller ID Data (as defined below) to CallerCenter so that information can be made available to Members; or (ii) submitted his or her phone number to CallerCenter to request that we block information from appearing in CallerCenter results; and the term “<strong>Member</strong>” means a user who has registered with CallerCenter and created an account. <br>
  <strong>Information - What We Collect and How We Use It</strong><br>
  <strong>What we collect.</strong> <br>
  We collect information from users to provide and improve our Site and the CallerCenter Service and to administer use of CallerCenter by Members and Non Registered Users.&nbsp; This information includes “<strong>Mobile Phone Data</strong>” which is the data contained on a mobile phone which you choose to upload to CallerCenter , including but not limited to your mobile phone contacts and your mobile phone number; and “<strong>Caller ID Data</strong>” which is the data and any other information that you choose to submit to us as a Member or Non Registered User to display in CallerCenter Caller ID results for your own phone number, including but not limited to your name, phone number, and other contact details.<br>
  In the course of using CallerCenter, some of what we’ll ask you for is considered “<strong><em>Personal Information</em></strong>.”&nbsp; This term refers to personally identifiable information about you that can be used to contact or identify you. Such Personal Information typically includes but is not limited to your name, phone number, email address, credit card or other billing information, and home and business postal addresses. While some Personal Information is required to join CallerCenter, you have the option to provide additional Personal Information in your CallerCenter Caller ID Data.<br>
  We may also ask for other information, such as your zip code and personal preferences, which is typically considered “<strong><em>Non-Identifying Information</em></strong>” since it can’t be used to identify you on its own. Sometimes Non-Identifying Information can be considered part of your Personal Information if it is combined in such a way that it enables you to be identified (for example, combining your zip code with your street address).<br>
  <strong>How we use it.</strong> <br>
  We use your Personal Information (in some cases with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the CallerCenter Service, and to respond to your inquiries.<br>
  We may also use your Personal Information with your Non-Identifying Information and combine it internally with information collected from other CallerCenter Users (as defined below) so as to provide you with a better experience; improve CallerCenter and understand how our services are used; and to serve you specifically, for instance to send you administrative notices or to deliver a product to you according to your individual preferences or restrictions.<br>
  Except as set forth in the section below titled “Information Sharing and Disclosure”, we never disclose your Personal Information to anyone without your permission.<br>
  <em><u>Technical Data</u></em><u>.</u>&nbsp; When you visit the Site or interact with one of our services, whether as a Member, Non Registered User or a visitor just browsing (any of these, a “<strong><em>CallerCenter User</em></strong>”), our servers automatically record certain information that your browser transmits so that we may keep track of which of our services you access. We do this in order to ensure that the elements of the CallerCenter Service are available to you and customized for your use. During this process we may also collect your IP address and browser details, as well as store cookies in your browser, all of which help us personalize and improve CallerCenter. While you have the option to stop your browser from accepting CallerCenter cookies at any time, if you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of CallerCenter or all of its functionality. For more information on how to stop accepting cookies, please refer to the help menu for your web browser.<br>
  <em><u>Additional Phones</u></em><u>.</u>&nbsp; CallerCenter is for use only with mobile phones that you own and control.&nbsp; We may send a security code to your mobile phone by text message to confirm that you own any phone you use with CallerCenter.<br>
  <strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong><br>
  <em><u>All CallerCenter Users</u></em><u>.</u>&nbsp;Any comments or submissions that you post to our corporate weblog, phone number complaint website, and support forums will be publicly available. Any information you choose to provide in a comment or a submission should reflect how much you want other users to know about you.&nbsp; We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage CallerCenter Users to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their comments or submissions.<br>
  <em><u>Members.</u></em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>If you call or text a Member, we will display the information from your Caller ID Data to them.<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>If you choose to use our free CallerCenter Caller ID service, CallerCenter will use the information in your mobile phone contacts, in addition to information made available via other third party sources, to verify Caller ID results for other Members. If you prefer not to allow CallerCenter to use the information in your mobile phone contacts in this manner or you do not have the permission of your contacts as required by the CallerCenter Terms of Service, do not opt in to use the free version of CallerCenter Caller ID.<br>
  <em><u>Non Registered Users</u></em><u>.</u>&nbsp; If you have submitted your Caller ID Data to CallerCenter this information will be shared with Members in accordance with the “user preferences” you set to make your Caller ID Data visible.<br>
  <em><u>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</u></em><u>.</u>&nbsp; We combine your Mobile Phone Data and Caller ID Data and the data of many other CallerCenter Users into anonymous sets of “<em>aggregated information</em>.”&nbsp; All Personal Information is stripped out and all mobile phone records are replaced with random numbers.&nbsp; We share this aggregated information, Non-Identifying Information, and log data with third parties for analysis so that we can continuously improve CallerCenter.&nbsp; We will not, however, share your Personal Information for these purposes.<br>
  <em><u>Service Providers</u></em><u>.</u>&nbsp; We may employ third party service providers to assist us in administering and providing CallerCenter.&nbsp; However, service providers never have access to your Personal Information in non-encrypted form except for information that they need to perform a specific task on our behalf.&nbsp; For example, a company managing our email list will have access to your email address if you receive email from CallerCenter.&nbsp; Such service providers are obligated not to disclose or use the data to which they have access for any other purpose. With your explicit prior permission in each case, we also provide outside technology developers who have registered with CallerCenter access to your Personal Information so that they can deliver products and services that you request, which may be used to enhance your use of CallerCenter.<br>
  <em><u>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</u></em><u>.</u>&nbsp; CallerCenter will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of CallerCenter or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.<br>
  <em><u>Business Transfers</u></em><u>.</u>&nbsp; CallerCenter may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information and your Mobile Phone Data or Caller ID Data, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy.<br>

<h3>callercenter.com Enables Consumers To Conduct a Reverse Phone Lookup On Unknown Numbers And Make Public, Online Complaints About Harassing Phone 

Callers</h3>

<br />

<h4>Learn from the personal experiences of other consumers as well as communicate your complaint to potentially thousands of other consumers</h4><br />



<p><b>Bellevue, WA . June 28, 2010 .</b>

callercenter.com today announced 

that due to the high volume of consumer complaints reported on its site 

regarding potential telemarketing fraud and harassing phone calls, it 

has enhanced its reverse phone lookup service with a dynamic heat map 

that helps users identify the area codes that have the most reports 

of potential fraud.<br /><br />

Every consumer experiences unwanted 

calls on their phones.  Some can be attributed to wrong numbers 

but there are a lot of different kinds of unwanted calls that can be 

truly annoying such as telemarketers and prank callers.  callercenter.com 

is a reverse phone lookup site and phone number consumer complaint service 

that makes it easier for consumers to accurately find callers identities, 

widely communicate complaints and read others complaints about harassing 

phone calls and potential telemarketing fraud.  <br /><br />

Until recently, most users could only 

complain to friends or file a complaint with various government organizations, 

such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These organizations don.t 

typically reveal complaint information to the public and rarely with 

any significant detail.  With this information, the consumer may 

be able to find out enough about their unwanted calls without having 

to pursue any additional action simply by using some of the information 

learned from finding callers. identities and reading other people.s 

complaints and comments. <br /><br />

callercenter.com is one of the 

few consumer advocate sites that goes one step further and reports valid 

phone number complaints to organizations that have the ability to investigate 

and take action. callercenter.com gives consumers the collective 

power to not only report potential fraud to each other, but bind together 

to take action to eliminate these phone callers altogether.  <br /><br />

callercenter.com is a leading 

provider of reverse phone number lookup services that enable consumers 

to simply search a number, including cell numbers (where available), 

landline numbers and VoIP to accurately find the owner of that number. 

Now you can be assured that if you don.t recognize a number or if 

you miss a call from a person that doesn.t leave a message, you can 

use this service to find out if the number is from a business associate, 

bill collector, or just a wrong number.  Reverse phone lookup services 

can be easier to use than traditional white pages people searches because 

phone numbers are more easily linked with specific people helping to 

get you to the right person faster.  <br /><br />

It is important as consumers to learn 

how to recognize and report telephone fraud to help stop some scams.<br /><br />

<h3>Organizations to contact:</h3>

<ul type="DISC">

  <li>Contact a consumer advocacy 

  group like the Better Business Bureau, which seeks to resolve complaints 

  on behalf of consumers.</li>

  <li>Look up the Attorney General.s 

  office for the state in which the business is based: <a href="http://www.naag.org" target="_blank">

<u>www.naag.org</u></a><font size="3" face="Calibri">.</li>

  <li>Contact the Federal Trade 

  Commission at <a href="http://ftc.gov/phonefraud" target="_blank">ftc.gov/phonefraud</a>.</li>

</ul>

Of course, if you put your number on 

the National Do Not Call Registry, you can reduce the number of unwanted 

telemarketing calls you get.<br /><br />
