We only have access to/collect personally identifiable information about you that you voluntarily give us. Other information we collect automatically – such information is not personally identifiable information; it relates to your use of the website and other statistical and page view information that our software collects automatically and is not linked to your personally identifiable information.

When you register your children for enrollment in Calvert Education schools or schools of our affiliated companies, we and they may collect information regarding you and your children; this information is only used to provide you with information about special promotions, new products and services, or upcoming events from Calvert Education and its affiliated schools, and only in compliance with FERPA.

We take the security of personally identifiable information very seriously. Our website and database servers are hosted in a secured physical and network environment. Reasonable efforts are made to secure web servers, networks, host operating systems and databases against unauthorized access.

Therefore we can only state that we will make a reasonable effort to protect from unauthorized access the information that you provide, and that if we are notified of a breach, we will comply with applicable law, however, unless a statute provides you a right that cannot be waived, you specifically waive and covenant not to sue us for any data loss or breach of our system resulting in loss of personal information.
