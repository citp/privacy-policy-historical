your own risk.</p>

<p>In the event of a complaint, we may receive personal information about you from other
parties in our Network, other Users or third parties who may communicate information to
us about you in relation to that complaint.</p>

are up to on the Internet and discuss privacy and safety issues with them. Public
discussion areas on the Network are not private. Any information posted by your child in
such areas may be seen, collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited

instruct your child not to post any such information without first seeking your permission.
