### INTRODUCTION

**_Caliber Home Loans, Inc._** and its affiliates (collectively " ** _Caliber Home Loans_** " or "we") will treat personal data that you provide through this web site or any related web sites (collectively the "Site") according to this privacy policy (this "Policy"), which is consistent with our treatment of personal data that you provide offline to us or to our brokers and dealers. By visiting the Site, you agree to be bound by this Policy. 

### FOREIGN VISITORS

If you are visiting the Site from outside the United States, please do not provide any personal data through the Site or by e-mail, as this Policy may not comply with local laws in your jurisdiction. 

### CHILDREN

This Site is not intended for visitors under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal data from or about people under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly market our products or services to people under 18 years of age. 

### PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT FROM VISITORS

Personal data identifies an individual by, for example, name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. We may collect the following types of personal data: (1) if you apply for a job, your name, address, references, and employment history; (2) if you apply for credit, your name, address, social security number, credit history, and financial information, directly or through one of our brokers or dealers; (3) if you use this site to check the status of your account, your name, account number, and other information, such as a password, to verify your identity; and (4) if you send us e-mail or request information, your name, email address, and any other personal data you supply in your e-mail message. 

### OTHER DATA WE AUTOMATICALLY COLLECT

When you visit the Site, **_Caliber Home Loans_** collects certain non-personal data by various means, one of which is "cookies." A cookie is an alphanumeric string of text (a unique identifier) that our web-server stores in your computer by means of your web-browser. The cookie allows us to recognize your computer when you revisit the Site. We can then improve your use of the Site, for example by providing quick log-in, displaying only web pages that interest you, and saving you from retyping information in a form. Cookies also allow us to analyze aggregate traffic on the Site, in order to streamline navigation and keep the content fresh for all visitors. You can configure your browser to reject cookies, but doing so may disable some of the Site's features. Cookies do not contain personal data, nor can they read or transmit any data on your computer's hard drive. They can, nonetheless, be combined with personal data that you knowingly provide, to create a profile. ** _Caliber Home Loans_** does not use cookies in this manner without your express consent.

Regardless of cookies, all web-browsers transmit the IP address of the computer on which they are running (so that the web-server knows where to send the requested web page). We analyze IP addresses only in extraordinary circumstances to attempt to track hackers. 

### HOW WE USE THE DATA WE COLLECT

We may use the data that you provide as follows: (1) if you apply for a job, to consider you for the position and to contact references; (2) if you apply for credit, to assess your credit-worthiness (including retrieving credit reports) and to approve or reject your application; (3) if you check the status of your account, to respond to your inquiry; (4) if you send us e-mail or request information, to reply to your request. We may also use the data that you provide to help us improve the content and function of the Site or other sites, to better understand our customers and markets, to improve our products and services, to enhance our marketing and promotional efforts, to improve product offerings, and to later contact you, electronically or otherwise, about products or services that we believe will interest you. If required by law, such communications will explain how to "opt out" of receiving future communications. You cannot, however, opt out of receiving communications about your account, such as service announcements and administrative notices.
