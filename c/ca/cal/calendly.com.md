# Calendly - Privacy Policy

Effective May 18, 2018

Calendly LLC (“Calendly”, “we”, or “us”) recognizes the importance of privacy. We want you to feel confident using our services, and this privacy policy (“Policy”) is to help you understand and describe how we collect, use, and disclose information that we obtain about users of our websites, services, plug-ins, software or other Downloadable Tools (all of which we refer to as the “Platform”). This Policy describes the following:

  * What information we collect and how it is collected;
  * How we use the information;
  * With whom we may share information;
  * Legal basis for processing the information;
  * Your rights and choices;
  * Security and storage of the information;
  * Third party websites;
  * Users outside the United States;
  * California Disclosures; and
  * Changes to the Policy and Contact Information.



Throughout this document, we will use a few terms to describe various roles. Calendly Members have signed up to use our service and created an account. Calendly Users are people who are scheduling with a Calendly Member and have not registered and created an account with us.

We collect information about you directly from you and automatically through your use of our Platform. We may combine information automatically collected with other information that we have collected about you including from publicly available sources.

In order to help you protect yourself and your information, we encourage you to provide only that information that is necessary for using our Platform. For example, to schedule a meeting you may only need to provide us with a name, email address, date and time.

Calendly is not directed to children under thirteen (13) years of age and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will promptly delete such personal information from our systems.

  * **Appointment Information.** When a Calendly User comes to Calendly to schedule an event with a Calendly Member, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, email address and phone number; email addresses of other people; subject of the meeting; and any other information you provide us or as required by the Calendly Member you are scheduling with. If you receive an invitation from a Calendly Member but do not wish to become a Calendly User, please contact the Calendly Member who sent the invitation through other means to set up your meeting. 

A Calendly Member may also connect their calendar with Calendly. Our calendar integration only checks the duration and free/busy status of the events in your calendar so that we don't book you when you're busy. We never store who you're meeting with, their email, the meeting title or any other details about the appointments in your connected calendar.

  * **Account Information.** Calendly Members may give us permission to access their information in other services. For example, with your consent, you may link your Calendly account with your Google, Microsoft Office 365 account, or other similar service, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (like your basic profile or contacts). The information we get from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are. 
  * **Billing Information.** If you purchase a premium version of Calendly, our third-party payment processors will collect and store your billing address and credit card information. We store the last four digits of your credit card number, card type and the expiration date. 



Like many websites, we and our service providers use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information when you interact with us through your computer or mobile device subject to your opt-out preferences (see Your Rights and Choices section below).

Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings.

To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
