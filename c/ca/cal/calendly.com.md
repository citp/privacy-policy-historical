# Calendly - Scheduling appointments and meetings is super easy with Calendly.

Calendly LLC (“Calendly”, “we”, or “us”) recognizes the importance of privacy. We want you to feel confident using our services, and this privacy policy (“Policy”) is to help you understand and describe how we collect, use, and disclose information that we obtain about users of our websites, services, plug-ins, software or other Downloadable Tools (all of which we refer to as the “Platform”).

Throughout this document, we will use a few terms to describe various roles. Calendly Members have signed up to use our service and created an account. Calendly Users are people who are scheduling with a Calendly Member and have not registered and created an account with us.

### Information We Collect

We collect information about you directly from you and automatically through your use of our Platform. We may combine information automatically collected with other information that we have collected about you.

In order to help you protect yourself and your information, we encourage you to provide only that information that is necessary for using our Platform. For example, to schedule a meeting you may only need to provide us with a name, email address, date and time. 

### Information You Provide

  * **Appointment Information.** When a Calendly User comes to Calendly to schedule an event with a Calendly Member, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, email address and phone number; email addresses of other people; subject of the meeting; and any other information you provide us or as required by the Calendly Member you are scheduling with. 

A Calendly Member may also connect their calendar with Calendly. Our calendar integration only checks the duration and free/busy status of the events in your calendar so that we don't book you when you're busy. We **never know** who you're meeting with, their email, the meeting title or any other details about the appointments in your calendar.

  * **Account Information.** Calendly Members may give us permission to access their information in other services. For example, with your consent, you may link your Calendly account with your Google, Microsoft Office 365 account, or other similar service, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (like your basic profile or contacts). The information we get from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are. 
  * **Billing Information.** If you purchase a premium version of Calendly, our third party payment processors will collect and store your billing address and credit card information. We store the last four digits of your credit card number and the expiration date. 



### Information Collected Automatically

Like many websites, we and our service providers use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information when you interact with us through your computer or mobile device. Using these technologies helps us customize your experience with our Services, improve your experience, and make tailor marketing messages. Here are some of the types of information we collect:

  * **Log & Device data.** When you use Calendly, our servers automatically record information (“log data”), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Website. This log data may include your web address you came from or are going to, your device model, operating system, browser type, unique device identifier, IP address, mobile network carrier, and time zone or location. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider. 



### Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms

  * **Cookie data.** Depending on how you’re accessing our products, we may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Calendly account or your browser) or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to keep you logged in to Calendly. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Calendly account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not. To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Calendly if your computer supports such capabilities. You can opt out of receiving emails from us. Please see the Your Choices section below. 
  * **Other Web Site Analytics Services.** We use third party service providers such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Kissmetrics to provide certain analytics and user interactions services to Calendly in connection with our operation of our site, including the collection and tracking of certain data and information regarding the characteristics and activities of visitors Calendly. You may opt-out of third party cookies from Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Kissmetrics’ Opt-Out Feature on their respective websites. We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.

### Security

We have taken steps to help protect the personal information we collect. These measures include using SSL encryption and two-factor authentication. Unfortunately, no measures can be guaranteed to provide 100% security. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your information in all circumstances.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your device and account by, among other things, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

### Third-Party Links

Our Site, App, and Services may contain links to third-party websites and applications. Any access to and use of such linked websites and applications is not governed by this Policy but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites or applications.

### E-mail Security.

"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it is from Calendly asking you for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your password, username, credit card information, or other personal information through e-mail.

### International Users

Our application and database servers are located with Amazon Cloud Services in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect (including cookies and other web technologies) will be processed and stored in the United States. By submitting your personal information to Calendly and using Calendly, you expressly consent to having your personal data transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States which may not offer the same level of privacy protection as those in the country where you reside or are a citizen.
