Although we cannot guarantee the confidentiality of the information provided, the California Lottery will not voluntarily disclose any personal information collected except 1) when required by law to do so, 2) when disclosure is necessary to protect the California Lottery's rights or property, or 3) during emergencies when the California Lottery believes physical safety is at risk.
