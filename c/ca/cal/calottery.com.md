## We protect your personal information.....

The California Lottery ([www.calottery.com](http://www.calottery.com/)) is committed to protecting your privacy rights.  It is the policy of the California Lottery to limit the collection of your personal information and protect the personal information it collects and maintains.

   
The Lottery’s information management practices conform to the requirements of the Information Practices Act (California Civil Code section 1798 et seq.), the California Public Records Act (California Government Code section 6250 et seq.), California Government Code sections 11015.5 and 11019.9, California Business & Professions Code sections 22575-22579, and other laws pertaining to information privacy.

The Lottery adheres to the following principles in connection with the collection, use and sharing of your personal information:

 **The Lottery collects personal information from individuals only as allowed by law and with their explicit consent.** The Lottery limits the collection of personal information to what is relevant and necessary to accomplish its lawful purpose, as defined in the California State Lottery Act. For example, the Lottery may need an individual’s home address, email address, or telephone number in order to answer that person’s questions, process his or her claim form, or provide some other requested assistance. The Lottery may also request demographic information such as ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests, and favorites in order to personalize and improve its services.  Website visitors who have registered on the Website may request to have their personal information discarded without reuse or distribution. To make such a request, contact the Lottery’s privacy coordinator at the following email address: [privacy at calottery dot com.](mailto:privacy@calottery.com)

  
**The Lottery does not collect home, business, or email addresses or account information from people who simply browse the Lottery’s website, but it does automatically collect certain information from website visitors.** The Lottery website consists of a primary domain and several sub-domains and is referred to collectively as “Website.” The Lottery only collects your personal information if you voluntarily provide it to us through email, registration forms, or surveys. The Lottery does automatically collect some information from each visitor to its Website, including the domain name or Internet Protocol address that relates to the machine used to access the Website, the type of browser and operating system used, and the date and time when you visit the Website. The Lottery may also automatically collect information about your interaction with Lottery Website, mobile application and services. For example, it may use analytics tools on its Website to retrieve information from your browser, including the website you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find the Lottery’s Website, the pages you view within the Lottery’s Website, your browser add-ons, and your browser's width and height.  This automatically-collected information is not subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act.   


**This Website and the California Lottery mobile application (the “App”) use "cookies" and “anonymous identifiers” to help personalize your online experience and to collect usage statistics.** Cookies store your site usage, preferences and user information, which will facilitate the future implementation of personalization and provide the Lottery with valuable information for site and application improvements. Anonymous identifiers are random strings of characters that are used for the same purposes as a cookie on platforms, including certain mobile devices, where cookie technology is not available. 

Cookies used by the Lottery are encrypted and cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.

  
The Lottery uses session cookies when you visit and search informational content on the Lottery’s Website.  Session cookies do not contain user information, will not transmit any personal information to the Lottery, and are deleted automatically when the browser window closes or within 24 hours, whichever occurs first.   


The Lottery also uses persistent cookies, which you must manually delete. For example, the Lottery uses persistent cookies to collect username and language setting information.    


To access certain Lottery Website and App services you will need to provide your email address and password (credentials). The Lottery will then assign and temporarily store your unique ID number and the time you signed in via an encrypted cookie on your computer or device. This cookie will allow you to move between services on the Website or App without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer or device. 

The Lottery also uses cookies to improve your sign-in experience on the Website. For example, the Lottery may store your email address in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows the Lottery to pre-populate your email address the next time you sign in to the Website. 

**The Lottery also  may permit third party analytics providers, such as Google Analytics to use cookies and anonymous identifiers to collect and process certain non-personally identifiable information.**  For example, Google Analyitcs may collect and process information such as how often users visit the Website or the App and, what pages they visited.  

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you will not be able to sign in or use other interactive features and services offered in the players’ area of the Lottery’s Website. 

  
If you choose to accept cookies, you also have the ability to later delete cookies that you have accepted. For example, in Internet Explorer 10 you can delete cookies by selecting “Tools,” “Safety,” “Delete browsing history,” “Cookies” and “Delete.” Each browser may provide a different way to delete cookies. If you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies will be deleted and may need to be recreated when you next access the Website. The Lottery prohibits on its Website any third party web beacons that collect or access your personal information.
