You may use the attached model return form (Annex 3) that can be found online, but it is not obligatory.

To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.

**Effects of withdrawal**

If you withdraw from your order, we will reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of standard delivery and eventual administration fees, without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to return products. We may however withhold reimbursement until we have received the products back or until you have supplied evidence of having sent back the products, whichever is the earliest. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement. Costs of delivery will not be reimbursed in case you withdraw only part of your order. 

You will return the products or hand them over to us, without undue delay and in any event not later than 28 days from the day on which you communicate your withdrawal from this contract to us. The deadline is met if you send back the products before the period of 28 days has expired.

We will bear the cost of returning the products. You are only liable for any diminished value of the products resulting from the handling other than what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the products.
