At Calendars.com we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting Calendars.com, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy notice. 

**Information Collection**  
When you visit the Calendars.com site, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes the pages visited and the types of products purchased. We then aggregate this information with thousands of other pieces of information to improve our site and make your shopping time on the site as valuable and efficient as possible. 

We will not rent or sell your name, address, email address, credit card information or personal information to any third party without your permission. However, we must cooperate fully should a situation arise where we are required by law or legal process to provide information about a customer. 

**Information We Need**  
When you order, we need to know your name, email address, shipping address, billing address, phone number, and credit card number with expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. We ask for your phone number in the event that our customer service representatives or delivery services need to contact you about your order. To simply create an account, we will only need your name, email address, and a password. 

**Saved Information**  
We save the information about products you purchased to provide you with the best possible customer service and the most up-to-date information about your order. You can view your past and current orders online by logging into the My Account section with your private password. 

If you forget your password, we will first verify your identity and then email your password to the email address you have listed in your account. 

**Changing Your Information With Calendars.com**  
If at any time you would like to change any information in your account, just go to the My Account link in the upper right-hand corner of each page. Here you can change or update your email address and password, billing address, payment options, shipping options, address book, and email preferences. Be sure to click Save My Changes when you have updated your account.

Please reply using the email address at which you have received mailings from us, and we will remove you from our list. You may also change your email preference on the Account Profile page under the My Account link on any page. 

Our policy is intended to provide you with the safest and most secure shopping experience possible. Since the law, offerings and technologies change, we reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of our privacy policy at any time without prior notice.
