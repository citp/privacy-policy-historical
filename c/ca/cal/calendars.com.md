**INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY**  
The following describes various types of technologies we will use when you interact with the Site and your choices regarding those technologies:  
_Cookies, Pixel Tags, and Flash Cookies_  
On the Site, and other digital platforms, we use Cookies, Pixel Tags, and Flash Cookies.   
A Cookie is a small piece of code sent by a website that is store on your hard disk by your computer’s browser. A pixel tag (also known as a tracking pixel, web beacon, or clear GIF) is an embedded image on a website that monitors a website activity. A Flash Cookie is a data file stored on your computer by the websites that you visit. Flash Cookies provide similar functionality as Cookies, but are based on different technology, provide richer data collections, and are persistent.

At Calendars.com, we use two kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open. We use session cookies, for example, to add items to your shopping bag.  Persistent cookies last from visit to visit; they do not go away when you exit your browser. At Calendars.com, we use persistent cookies to give you a more personalized shopping experience and to help you navigate our Site more efficiently.  For example, we use persistent cookies to show you items you have previously browsed.   

  Managing cookies preferences differs from browser to browser so please refer to your browser for further information.  If you would like to disable cookies and web beacons from Calendars.com, please use the help function in your web browser to restrict cookies from our Site.

We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Calendars.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

 _Website Optimization Services_  
Calendars.com shares data with Google Analytics and Monetate to understand and optimize website performance and enhance site usability for our customers. These tools run in the background of our site analyzing site usage information and then returning reports to us through an encrypted connection. Each is required to maintain data securely and confidentially and is not permitted to share data collected with anyone other than Calendars.com. Credit card or password information is not collected by or shared with either Google Analytics or Monetate. _Interest-Based or Online Behavioral Advertising_  
Calendars.com uses third-party advertising companies to serve interest-based advertisements. These companies compile information from various online sources (including mobile-enabled browsers and applications) to match user profiles with ads we believe will be most relevant, interesting and timely based on that user profile. _Display Advertising_  
We may utilize Google Analytics tools, including Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, Double-Click Campaign Manager Integration, or Google Analytics Demographics and Impression Recording to support display advertising. We may frame or mask another website so that the look, feel and interface simulate the experience of browsing a genuine Calendars.com web page. Extreme care and discretion is exercised when evaluating third party sites. We only brand third part sites if their organization applies stringent security and privacy practices which parallel our own commitment to safe online shopping.  _Social Network Programs_  
Calendars.com has relationships with several social networks. These companies allow Calendars.com to match users that have shown interest in Calendars.com with their social profiles in order to deliver relevant, interest-based ads on those companies’ networks. _Do Not Track_  
Calendars.com does not currently have the capability to recognize browser Do Not Track signals. Please use the following link to learn more about DNT: [http://www.allaboutdnt.org/](http://www.allaboutdnt.org/)

**_Interactions with Third-Party Websites and Content_**  
We may enable you to navigate to third-party sites and services, or otherwise display third-party content. We do this for your convenience. We do not endorse or generally have any affiliation with these third parties. We do not control and are not responsible for their web practices. Whether the third-party content appears within our web environment (like a map frame), or you leave our web site for another site to view it, those service provider's terms, conditions, and privacy policies govern your online experience. Please view their terms of service and privacy policies if you have any question about their practices.

  Here's a partial list of the sites or content of these third parties:

We may facilitate easy access to the online maps of content providers like Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! There you can get quick location, driving, and contact information for our stores.

  2.  Sweepstakes, Contests, and Survey Sites  
We may rely on the expertise of third-party service providers to run sweepstakes, contests, and surveys. Navigation to these sites may be seamless so that it appears you're still in our Site environment. In these cases, the third-party's privacy policy may apply to any personal information you provide in connection with the event. So please take note of who's running the event in question; and the terms, conditions, and policies that apply.

  3.  Social Networking or Other User-Generated-Content Sites, and Other Websites  
We may at times facilitate easy access to third-party sites, like social networking sites and other sites that host user-generated content.
