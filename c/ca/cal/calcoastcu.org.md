We reserve the right to change this Online Privacy Policy, along with related procedures, at any time by providing you with a new privacy policy.

Examples of businesses with which information may be shared include:

If you terminate your membership or become an inactive member, we will not share information we have collected about you, except as permitted or required by law.

**We Protect Your Information**

The credit union maintains strong security policies and controls to ensure that information in our files and computers is protected. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards. This includes up-to-date security technology to safeguard your information from unauthorized access. 

  * Cal Coast Online and Cal Coast Mobile are communicated in a secure mode. Information is encrypted before it is transmitted so that unauthorized access will not compromise information.
  * E-mails sent without logging in to Cal Coast Online may not be secure. Do not send confidential information such as social security or account numbers to us through an unsecured email.
  * We provide a number of additional security features for Cal Coast Online. After logging in, Cal Coast Online will "timeout" after 15 minutes of inactivity. If a password is repeatedly entered incorrectly, access to Cal Coast Online will be locked until the credit union is contacted.
