<b>What does this Privacy Policy apply to? </b></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>This Privacy Policy applies solely to The Casual Collective located at 
www.casualcollective.com. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other web 
sites (even those that are referenced on, or linked to through, The Casual 
Collective) or websites maintained by other companies or organizations.<br>

your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy,

Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on The Casual Collective

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>How does The Casual Collective collect information? </span></b></p>

<p><span>In connection with its games, The Casual Collective collects information from you in three ways.</span></p>

<ol>
 <li><span>When you play certain Casual Collective games (such Minions or Splitter 2), information 
     about your game play may be collected and transmitted to The Casual 
     Collective. The Casual Collective may use such information in connection 
     with The Casual Collective as set forth in this Privacy Policy whether or 
     not you register on or use The Casual Collective.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol>
 <li><span>You may choose to voluntarily provide us with various personal information and non-personal information through your use of The Casual Collective.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol start="3" type="1">
 <li><span>We may automatically collect certain non-personal information from you in connection with your use of The Casual Collective.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>What information does The Casual Collective collect? </span></b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The Casual Collective may receive information regarding your game play and usage 
without any additional notice to you or actions taken by you. The Casual 
Collective will not receive personal information such as your name and address 
but may receive other information such as your email address, game played, game 
score, performance, Internet Protocol (IP) address or other information and 
statistics regarding your usage of the games. <br>

<br>
When you register and use The Casual Collective, you may voluntarily provide, 
and The Casual Collective may collect, personal and non-personal information in 
the form of website registration data (name, email, etc), and other data 
necessary to fulfill your requests, participate in game-specific services, and 
participate in special services such as newsletter subscriptions, "email this 
page" features, technical support, demos, downloads, polls, surveys, contests, 
sweepstakes, or other promotions. The Casual Collective may also passively 
collect certain information about your use of The Casual Collective, such as 
the pages you visit and the features you use (see "Cookies" below).<br>
<br>
<span><b>A Special Note about our Message Boards and Chat Rooms</b></span>
<br>
Whenever you give out personal information in public areas such as on a message 
board, that information can be collected and used by other people. While we 
strive to protect those who wish to participate in these services, we cannot 
guarantee the security of any information you post in these areas.<br>
<br>
<span><b>E-mail Correspondence</b></span> </span></p>

<p><span>We may collect personal information about you, such as your e-mail address or any 
other personal data contained in the registration process.  We will never sell 
your email address; we only use the information for the purpose of promotions 
about Casual Collective games. If you do not with to receive emails, you have 
the ability to unsubscribe.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information? </span></b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Your refusal to submit personal information may limit your ability to participate in 
some activities on The Casual Collective. However, as described above, The 
Casual Collective may nonetheless post game play boards that contain certain 
information as a result of your use of the games.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>Does The Casual Collective use cookies, track IP Addresses or use other passive means to collect information? </span></b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The Casual Collective may use cookies and similar tracking devices. A 
"cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that websites 
often store on a user's computer. Cookies generally do not include people's 
names, e-mail addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; 
they are typically used to quickly identify a user's computer and to 
"remember" things about the user's visit (such as the user's use of 
various features on the service). You can always disable cookies or set your 
browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer; however, 
disabling cookies may affect your ability to use certain portions of The Casual 
Collective.<br>
<br>
The Casual Collective may also keep track of your Internet Protocol (IP) and 
computer MAC addresses for various reasons. An IP address is a number that is 
used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log 
on to the Internet. A computer MAC address identifies one specific piece of 
hardware.<br>
<br>
Other information that may be passively collected by Casual Collective includes 
log files that record website activity, including how many "hits" a 
particular web page is getting (a.k.a. "navigational data"). These 
entries are generated anonymously and enable Casual Collective to assess overall 
online activity and a user's browsing habits, track interest in advertised 
sales, and troubleshoot technical concerns. We also use the log file entries 
for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly 
improve the online services we provide you.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>Who is collecting my information and how will it be used? </span></b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>When you submit information on The Casual Collective, or information is 
automatically collected as described in this Privacy Policy, The Casual 
Collective uses the submitted information to send you promotional materials, to 
provide you with access to our services, to fulfill product orders, and to 
respond to questions or technical problems. We also use your personal information 
for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly 
improve the products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs.
</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>With whom does The Casual Collective share my personal information? </span></b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The Casual Collective does not share your personal information with any third 
parties. In the event we offer services or promotions where your information is 
separately collected and used according to the privacy policy of a third-party, 
we will inform you of that at the time of collection and you may elect not to 
participate in the service or promotion We also may share your information with 
third parties as required by law enforcement or other government officials in 
connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, 
or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability. 
In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, 
or other similar event involving all or a portion of The Casual Collective, 
Casual Collective's customer information may be transferred to our successor or assign.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding anything else herein, we may partner with third party advertisers who may (themselves or through their partners) 
place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. These cookies  enable more customized ads, content or services to be provided to you. 
To trigger these cookies, we may pass an encrypted or "hashed" (non-human readable) identifier corresponding to your email address to a Web 
advertising partner, who may place a cookie on your computer. No personally identifiable information is on, or is connected to, these cookies.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>You should be aware that while you are on The Casual Collective you could be

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>To protect your personal information, The Casual Collective maintains reasonable
