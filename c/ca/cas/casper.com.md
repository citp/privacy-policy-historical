# Casper Sleep Website Privacy and Cookies Policy | Casper®

Effective Date: January 31, 2017

This Privacy Policy applies to [casper.com](https://web.archive.org/) (the “ **Site** ”) and all other websites owned and operated by Casper Sleep Inc. The term “ **Casper** ,” “ **we** ,” and “ **us** ” includes Casper Sleep Inc. and our affiliates and subsidiaries.

The Privacy Policy explains how Casper may:

  * collect,
  * use, and
  * disclose



Personal Information (defined below) we obtain through the Site, your communications with us, or from third parties. It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information.

“ **Personal Information** ” means information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you, such as: name, address, email address, or phone number. We do not consider Personal Information to include information that has been anonymized such that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual.

### The site collects your information

#### We collect Personal Information when you choose to provide it to us including when you:

 **Register an account.** The Site gives you the option of creating a user account (an “Account”). If you decide to create an Account, you will provide us with certain Personal Information, such as your user name and password. You are not required to register to use the Site.

 **Purchase a Casper product.** When you purchase a Casper product using the Site, you are given the option of logging into an Account or checking out as a guest. In either case, when you purchase a Casper product, you will provide us with Personal Information, such as your name, email address, and shipping address.

 **Make a payment.** When you make a payment through the Site, you may need to provide Personal Information to our third party payment processors. Such Personal Information may include sensitive Personal Information, such as your credit card number.

 **Submit information to the Site.** We collect information you submit to the Site. For example, when you post a review of a Casper product on the Site or refer a friend to Casper using the Site, the Site will collect the information in your submission to the Site, including any Personal Information. If you choose to submit content to any public area of the Site, such content will be considered “public” and will not be subject to the privacy protections set forth herein.

 **Communicate with us.** We may also collect Personal Information from you when you communicate with us. For example, you may send us Personal Information by writing an email to us, subscribing to the Casper newsletter, or making a reservation for an event hosted by Casper. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.

 **Take a survey.** From time to time, we may contact you to participate in online surveys. If you do decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include Personal Information. For example, you may be asked to provide contact information as well as information about your height, weight, gender or date of birth.

 **Information you provide about a third party.** If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about Casper, we may collect your friend's Personal Information, such as name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to purchase a Casper product. We store your friend’s information in order to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.

 **Passive collection.** The Site collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you use it, including your preferences and anonymous usage statistics. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We use this data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site. Non-personal information that we passively collect may be combined with other information about you, including Personal Information.

 **Tracking technologies.** Casper and its partners use cookies, pixels, server logs, and other similar technology to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service. Non-personal information that we collect using these technologies may be combined with other information about you, including Personal Information.

 **Information provided by third parties.** Casper may collect information about you from third parties or supplement the information we collect from you with additional records received from third parties. Information is collected from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to offer you information that we believe may be of interest to you.

### How Casper uses your information

 **We use Personal Information to facilitate and improve our services, and communicate with you.**

 **Internal and service-related usage.** We use and retain information, including Personal Information, to improve and facilitate the Site and our services. We may also use such data to help us deliver targeted advertising to consumers that is displayed on both Casper websites and unaffiliated websites, to analyze interactions with and performance of our Site, to measure the effectiveness of advertising on behalf of our advertising partners, and to identify the audience most likely to respond to an advertisement. We may also use data from third parties (such as data vendors) pursuant to their own privacy policies, and enhance information (including Personal Information) that we have collected with such third-party data. We believe that the use of such information is helpful to providing users with better services. However, if you would like to opt-out of these interest-based advertisements, please follow the opt-out process described below under “Choice.”

 **Communications.** We may send email to the email address you provide to us to verify your account and for informational and operational purposes, such as account management, customer service, or system maintenance.

 **Marketing.** We may use information about you, including Personal Information, to send you information about Casper’s products and services.

### Choice

As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.

To manage our advertising on other sites, we engage third party advertising partners. These third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on the Site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. Certain of our third party advertising partners participate in self-regulatory organizations, and those organizations operate websites that give you the ability to opt-out of receiving targeted ads from those partners.  You can access these websites, and also learn more about targeted advertising and privacy, at [Network Advertising](https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) or [AboutAds](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

 **To be clear, whether you are opting out by adjusting your browser/device settings or by using a website established by a self-regulatory group, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out.** For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device.

Please note that we do not respond to or honor “do not track” (a/k/a/ DNT) signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.

If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email to opt out of receiving future emails. We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. We are not responsible for removing your personal information from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided with your information in accordance with this policy.
