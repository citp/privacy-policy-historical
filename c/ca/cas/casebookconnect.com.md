# Privacy Statement | Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory

The Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory U.S. division of CCH Incorporated (“ _ **WKL** **& R**_,” “ _ **CCH**_ ,” “ _ **us**_ ,” “ _ **our**_ ” or “ _ **we**_ ”) has developed this privacy statement for you, the visitor/user, to demonstrate its commitment to privacy on the Internet. This statement ( ** _“Privacy Statement”_** or ** _“Statement_** ”) applies to the information gathering, use and dissemination practices for WKL&R operated eStores and other Web-enabled and accessible services and applications (collectively, the “ _ **Services**_ ”), including www.lrus.wolterskluwer.com and all other Web sites, mobile applications and Internet-accessible products and services operated by WKL&R (collectively, the “ _ **WKL &R Properties**_”). By entering or using any WKL&R Property or Service, you are acknowledging and accept these terms as applying to such use.

 **1\. Application**  
This Privacy Statement applies to the online collection of personal information via the WKL&R Properties and Services. This Privacy Statement does not apply to information collected in any other way such as offline.

 **2\. Collection of Information from the WKL &R Properties**

We collect several types of information from users in various ways. Specifically, we collect information directly from users that they voluntarily provide and also through the use of automated tools to log users’ use of the Services. We use this information primarily to provide users with the Services they have chosen and to personalize their experience, delivery of services and provide other relevant information. Much of the information we collect (beyond the information provided directly by you) is not personally identifiable about you.

 **(a) User-Supplied Information**

We require users to provide us with personal information as a condition of using or accessing certain of our Services. This information may include name, email address, phone number, email address, payment card information, and/or certain additional categories of information. This information is used by us to verify that you are an authorized user of a Service, and whether on your own behalf or through a subscription obtained by your employer or organization. 

If you contact us for customer support, we may ask you to provide information about your computer or mobile device or about the issues you are trying to resolve. This information is necessary to help us answer your questions. We may record your requests and our responses for quality control purposes.

For some of our Services, we may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups, and/or offer the ability to post/share content on social media available to you. Any information posted or disclosed in these areas is public. As such, you should exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these areas, as this information is made available to other users. Do not disclose information in these public forums that might be considered confidential or proprietary or that you do not wish to be publicly available or that you are prohibited from disclosing.

 **(b) User Data Collection**

We may collect non-personally identifiable information in connection with your use of our Services and visits to the WKL&R Properties. For example, as you browse the WKL&R Properties we may collect information about your visit to monitor statistics such as the number of people that visit the WKL&R Properties or use our mobile applications, which page(s) are visited on our sites, from which domain our visitors come (e.g., google.com), and which browsers people use to visit our websites (e.g. Safari, Microsoft Internet Explorer, etc.). We also may compile statistics that show the numbers and frequency of visitors to our websites and applications, including individual pages. These aggregated statistics may be used internally to improve our Services and the WKL&R Properties and for product development and marketing purposes generally. The information we collect in Web server logs helps us administer our sites, analyze usage, protect the website and its content from inappropriate use, and improve user experience. In addition, aggregated statistics (which may contain personally identifiable information) may also be provided to advertisers and other third parties.

 **(c) Device Information  
**  
We may collect non-personal information about the mobile device or other device you use to access our Services and the WKL&R Properties, such as IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language and other transactional information.

 **(d) Location Information**

Some of our Services can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature of the application. If you enable the location-based feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device, which will then be used by the application. If you elect to have a location-based search saved to your history, we will store that information on our servers. If you do not enable the location-based service, or if an application does not have that feature, the application will not transmit to us, and we will not collect or store, location information.

 **(e) Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies**

In order to offer and provide a customized and personal service, we may use cookies to store and help track information about you, as well as Web beacons, HTML5 local storage and other similar technologies to manage access to and use of our Services, recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there. Cookies are simply small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. We use cookies and similar technologies to help remind us who you are and to help you navigate our sites during your visits. Cookies allow us to save passwords and preferences for you so you won’t have to reenter them each time you visit.

Internet cookies may save data about individual visitors, such as the visitor’s name, password, user-name, shopping cart, screen preferences, the pages of a site viewed by the visitor, and the advertisements viewed or clicked by the visitor. When you revisit a WKL&R Property, the site may recognize you by the Internet cookie and customize your experience accordingly. If you prefer, you can set your browser to either notify you when you receive a cookie or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that some features of many sites or applications may not function properly if you do not accept cookies. 

You have the right and ability to delete certain cookies placed on your computer hard drive. Doing so will erase the data about you when you revisit a WKL&R Property since you will not be recognized.   
Our websites and applications also may use local shared objects, also known as “Flash cookies” to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our websites to personalize your visit. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here.

 **(f) Do Not Track**

We do not use tracking cookies in order to generate or place targeted third party advertisements. Some browsers have a ‘do-not-track’ feature. When this feature is activated, we will “honor” such feature and as a result, not track site utilization to generate any targeted third party advertising based on such use.

 **3\. How we use User Information**

We use the information gathered from the Services and WKL&R Properties to provide Services to users, to maintain the security and integrity of our Services, for the purpose of conducting market research or surveys on our behalf, and for the administration, review and/or the improvement of the content of our Services. Aggregate data on users’ home servers may be used for internal purposes or provided to third parties, such as advertisers. 

Personal information, such as names, postal and email addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information that users voluntarily provide to us may be added to our contact databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding our Services, site or application updates, new products and services, upcoming events, and status of orders placed online. We also may enhance or merge user information with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services. If you do not wish to receive offers related to additional products and services that may be of interest to you, you may opt out from emails and by contacting us using the information below.

In some circumstances, the information you provide is aggregated with other data for statistical analysis and internal research purposes to help us understand who is using our sites and Services and become better equipped to serve your needs. We also keep this information in a contact database for future reference, as needed.

We may use demographic and preference information to allow advertising on one or more of our Services that can be targeted to the users for whom they are most pertinent. This means users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, improving both the viewer’s experience and the effectiveness of the ads.

We may remarket your information. Remarketing is a way for us to connect with users, based upon your past interactions with our Websites. We may hire third-party marketing vendors, such as Google, to perform remarketing services. As a result, such third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites on the internet, and may use cookies to serve specific ads based on a user’s prior visits to our Website(s). Users may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html. This information is used only for remarketing purposes and will not be used by them for any other purpose.

 **4\. Sharing User Information**

We share information collected though the Services and the WKL&R Properties as follows:

 **(a) Transactions**

We disclose information you provide to us to third parties in order to complete a transaction that you requested or as otherwise permitted by your organization’s customer agreement(s) (if any). For example, we contract with other companies to provide certain services on our behalf, including credit-card and billing processing, shipping, e-mail distribution, list processing and analytics or promotions management. These service providers are restricted from using this data in any way other than to provide services to us, and they may not share, resell or use the data for their own direct marketing purposes.

 **(b) Site Usage Vendors**

We use one or more third party web analytics service vendors to provide us information, reports and analysis about the usage and browsing patterns of users of our Services and visitors to the WKL&R Properties. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including your IP address or cookies. If these third party services collect information, they do so anonymously and in the aggregate to provide information helpful to us such as website trends, without identifying individual visitors. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) may be transmitted to, and stored at, data warehouses of ours or such vendors.

 **(c) Corporate Accounts**

If you have a corporate account with WKL&R, we may also share your information in accordance with your organization’s customer agreement(s) (if any) for products and services (including disclosure of personal information to the subscribing organization by agreement).

 **(d) Sharing Functionality**

You may elect to share content from the WKL&R Properties and/or Services to your friends using “sharing” functionality. In such case we will ask for your friend’s name and e-mail address and we will send your friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the applicable web page. We do not permanently store the names and email addresses of your friends and do not use that data for marketing purposes, other than sending the aforementioned one-time e-mail.

 **(e) Business Transactions**

We reserve the right to transfer or sell, in whole or part, any and all information collected through the Services or the WKL&R Properties as described herein to one or more entities in connection with the sale of all or some of the assets of WKL&R or its affiliates or subsidiaries through any corporate transaction, liquidation or bankruptcy process.

If you would prefer that we not share any of your personal information with unaffiliated third parties for them to market to you, please let us know by contacting us using the contact information below.

 **5\. Notice to Users/Visitors Residing Outside the United States**

WKL&R’s operations are located primarily in the United States. If you provide information to us or visit or use any of our Services or any of the WKL&R Properties, this information will be collected, maintained, and processed in the United States. Some WKL&R affiliates and subsidiaries with whom WKL&R shares user information are located outside the United States.

If you do not want to have your information processed and stored in the United States, please do not use our Services or visit any WKL&R Property.

 **6\. E-mail and E-Newsletter Communications**

We may communicate with you via e-mails or e-newsletters with news, promotional offerings, or services that we think may be of interest to you. When we communicate with you via e-mails or e-newsletters, we may insert pixel or html tags in the e-mails that, among other things, will tell us when emails are opened or when you click on promotions or other offerings from us. If you are a registered user (i.e., if you create a user account with us)and opt out of receiving marketing e-mails from us, you will continue to receive non-marketing (ie, informational or transactional) e-mail communications from us. If you are not a registered user and would rather not receive marketing e-mails or e-newsletters from us, you may “opt out” by following the “opt out” instructions in the email footer.

 **7\. Security Measures**

WKL&R has implemented numerous security features designed to help protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For instance, when a visitor places an order on this site or application (if any) or accesses his or her account information (if any), such information is captured on a secure server that encrypts the provided information in transit to us and when stored by us. Please be advised, however, that while we endeavor to create secure and reliable environment for our Services, the confidentiality and security of any communication or material transmitted to/from us via our Services or via e-mail cannot be guaranteed. Thus, despite these measures, we cannot guarantee that such efforts will prevent unauthorized access to such information. Accordingly, we and our affiliates are not responsible for the security or confidentiality of information transmitted or accessible via the Internet.

We store the information about you in a data center with restricted access and appropriate monitoring, and we use a variety of technical security measures to secure your data. In addition, we use intrusion detection and virus protection software. We also maintain policies or practices designed to limit access to your personal information to employees who need access in order to carry out their job responsibilities.

Your access to many of our Services and content may be password protected. You should take precautions to protect your user names and passwords, and we recommend that you refrain from disclosing your username(s) and password(s) to anyone. We also recommend that you sign out of your account or service at the end of each session. You may also wish to close your browser window when you have finished your work, especially if you share a computer with someone else or if you are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.

 **8\. Links to Other Sites**

The Services and the WKL&R Properties may contain links to websites maintained by others. This Privacy Statement does not reflect the privacy practices of those sites, and you should consult the privacy policies of those sites to learn about their practices.
