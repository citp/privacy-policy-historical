**THE INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE AND DISSEMINATION PRACTICES OF CASHNETWORK.COM.**

**1\. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION.**

**1.1 Survey Information.**

CASHNETWORK.COM collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by Third Parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, CASHNETWORK.COM or a Third Party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to CASHNETWORK.COM, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, postal/zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social insurance/security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information").

Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to CASHNETWORK.COM or Third Party.

**1.2 Site Membership or Registration.**

To the extent registration is required to receive email and possibly postal communications from CASHNETWORK.COM, this Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from CASHNETWORK.COM, whether at our Website, via email, on Third Party websites or otherwise. We collect information in certain portions of our Website, where guests provide content submissions and suggestions or participate in interactive online activities (i.e., by way of responding to questions and surveys, community listings, ratings, searches and comparison searches, bidding, purchasing, chat, games, or bulletin boards, etc.). The personal profile information you submit to CASHNETWORK.COM remains your property, but by submitting that information to CASHNETWORK.COM, you grant CASHNETWORK.COM, the right to use that information for marketing purposes. CASHNETWORK.COM may also use such information for content improvement and feedback purposes. We may sell the personal information that you supply to us and we may join together with other businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members. These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation. In addition, CASHNETWORK.COM reserves the right to release current or past member information in the event CASHNETWORK.COM believes that the membership is being or has been used in violation of the Rules or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, if CASHNETWORK.COM is sold or acquired, or when CASHNETWORK.COM deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any Third Party when CASHNETWORK.COM, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate.

"Subscription" occurs when an end-user registers for CASHNETWORK.COM's services, either via registration at our website, via co-registration at a marketing partner's website, or via a permission pass / opt-out / no-opt mailing. CASHNETWORK.COM collects personally identifiable information about our subscribers, based on: information gathered at the time of registration, subscriber interaction and response to subsequent electronic mailings and website use, information provided by marketing partners, and information appended from data aggregators. Information collected may include, but is not necessarily limited to: name, email address, postal address, gender, birth date, telephone number, activity, interests, user behavior and other demographic information. This information enables us to better tailor our content to subscribers' needs and to help our clients to promote and sell their products and services.

**1.3 Third Party List Information.**

CASHNETWORK.COM collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and CASHNETWORK.COM subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the "Seller").

When acquiring Third Party List Information, CASHNETWORK.COM seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to CASHNETWORK.COM and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from Advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.

**1.4 Other Information.**

Other occasions when CASHNETWORK.COM obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by CASHNETWORK.COM or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through CASHNETWORK.COM's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a CASHNETWORK.COM service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").

**1.5 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.**

CASHNETWORK.COM currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, CASHNETWORK.COM may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").

**(a) Cookies.**

A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows CASHNETWORK.COM to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in CASHNETWORK.COM's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.

**(b) Web Beacons.**

A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows CASHNETWORK.COM to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, CASHNETWORK.COM also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in CASHNETWORK.COM's database.

**(c) New Technology.**

The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is CASHNETWORK.COM's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, CASHNETWORK.COM strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.

**(d) Usage Tracking.**

CASHNETWORK.COM tracks information related to the electronic mailings and web pages viewed by users and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while viewing our emails or visiting our websites.

**(e) Log Files.**

Log files are used to track and monitor subscriber usage.

CASHNETWORK.COM will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 18. If CASHNETWORK.COM obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 18, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, CASHNETWORK.COM has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties. CASHNETWORK.COM has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").

**1.9 Credit Card Information.**

CASHNETWORK.COM may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from CASHNETWORK.COM.

**2.1 Discretion to Use Information.**

CASHNETWORK.COM MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION.

You may still receive electronic mailings sent on behalf of Third Parties and your personal information may still be shared with Third Parties for use in offline marketing and data appends, including email appends.

You should also note that unsubscribing from CASHNETWORK.COM's electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe the subscriber's information from any Third Party associates and licensees of the data.

This allows you the freedom to pick and choose which subscriptions to maintain and which to discontinue.

**2.6 Direct Mail and Telemarketing.**

CASHNETWORK.COM may use Individual Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones.

This information helps CASHNETWORK.COM to better understand the online habits of individuals so that CASHNETWORK.COM can target advertising and promotions to them.
