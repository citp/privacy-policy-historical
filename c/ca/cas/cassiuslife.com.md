We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Information.

  * Email Communications.

You should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data remaining in our archives because of backups and other reasons.
  * Opt-out of Targeted Advertising. If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt-out of some network advertising programs that use your information. Below are the steps you can take to opt-out of targeted advertising: 
    * Visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Opt-Out Page (<http://www.aboutads.info/choices>). The DAA Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have Cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.
    * ­If you are using one of our mobile applications, you can download App Choices (<http://youradchoices.com/appchoices>), which will allow you to opt-out of in-app tracking. You can also adjust the privacy settings on your mobile device by visiting the settings tab. If you wish to opt-out of cross-device tracking, you will need to opt-out of in app tracking on all of your devices.
    * ­Update the privacy settings in the Help section of your browser, or in the Settings tab on your mobile device.
    * ­You may also click on the Ad Choices icon in the advertisement.
    * ­You may opt out of additional third party advertising networks by going to the Network Advertising Initiative’s Website (<http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>) and following the directions provided.
    * ­Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive.



Please note that even if you choose to remove your information or “opt-out,” you will still see advertisements while you are browsing online; however, those advertisements will no longer be tailored to your interests. Additionally, information regarding your usage of the online services may still be collected for research, analytics or internal operations purposes. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of any such opt-out options.

  * Do Not Track Signals. iONE Digital does not currently take actions to respond to “Do Not Track Signals” because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.
