### Data automatically collected
    
    
    We log visitor’s domain and IP address automatically; this information does not identify you as an individual, but only the computer that is being used to view the website. This data is used to see where the website is being used in the world to ensure coverage, and for click stream analysis to help better understand site usage, so that we can improve our service to you. We do not link information automatically logged by such means with personal data about specific individuals. 
    
    Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer as a result of visiting a web site. This allows the site to know that you have visited before and in some cases can be used to record your preferences.

### Cookies
    
    
    We use cookies for two reasons 

  * To help us track usage patterns in order to improve and manage our sites 
  * To record preferences in order to personalise your visit


    
    
    There are four types of cookies used on this website:

### Session Cookies
    
    
    These are temporary cookies that only remain until your browser is closed. They are used by our web application in order to maintain the information relating to your transaction from page to page following any input, such as when a form is completed over several screens.

### Web Analytics Cookies
    
    
    These cookies are used to help us compile anonymous statistics in order to improve and manage our sites. An example of the information collected would be the path you used to gain access to the site and your patterns of browsing when navigating the site. They are ‘persistent’ meaning they are not deleted when the browser is closed and expire after a period of 2 years unless you visit the same site within the 2 year period in which case the same cookie is refreshed and a new 2 year period begins.

### Information Cookie
    
    
    These cookies allow the site to remember how you have answered a question in order to change the content displayed to you. For example, if you have already taken a survey this cookie will ensure you are not asked again. They are ‘persistent’ meaning they are not deleted when the browser is closed, and expire after a period of 2 months.

### Membership Cookie
    
    
    These cookies are used to provide you with access to membership services you have subscribed to. They are ‘persistent’ meaning they are not deleted when the browser is closed, and expire after a period of 2 months.
    
    You can still use most of this site with cookies turned off. To stop cookies being placed on your terminal equipment refer to your specific internet browser. In a few cases blocking cookies may reduce the functionality of some sites or prevent access to them depending on your chosen browser options. 
    
    Cookies can also easily be deleted through your specific internet browser, although this means your settings will not be retained.

    Except as set out above, we will not pass your details to anyone else outside the Castrol Group without your permission. Since Castrol operates globally, the information you submit may be transferred outside of the UK. This and all other transmissions will remain secure and under our control. By clicking the ‘I accept’ button where you offer your information in return for information, goods, products and services, you consent to such a transfer. 
    
    If we look to use your personal data for a new purpose, beyond what it was originally provided for, we will ask for your consent. You can choose to provide this consent in advance by indicating in the ‘opt-in’ box at the point that personal data is collected.

### Site traffic information and cookies 
    
    
    Servers located within BP and hosted by third party service providers outside the European Economic Area automatically log data about your visit to our site based on your IP address. This information does not identify you as an individual, but identifies the computer or other device you use to access the website. This information we collect is used to see where the site is being used in the world to ensure coverage, and for click stream analysis to help better understand site usage. 
    
    During the course of your visit to our website, we may also automatically download short text files called "cookies" to your computer. Cookies enable us to provide you with a better online experience by enabling the site to know that you have visited before and in some cases to record preferences in order to personalise your visit. Cookies do not identify the individual user, but only the computer that is being used to view the site. We also use analytics cookies to enhance the performance of the website by collecting information about how many visitors we have and how they use the website (e.g. which pages most visitors go to most often). 
    
    The information these cookies collect is not used to identify who you are, send you targeted advertising or remember where you’ve been on the internet.
