# Privacy Notice

Privacy Notice to Customers with a CashX account issued by 

Citrus Bank N.A.

Keeping customer information secure and using it only as our customers would want us to is a top priority for us. That’s why we do not disclose any non-public personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, including non-affiliated third parties, except as permitted by law.

“Non-public personal information” is information about you and your relationship with us that is not generally available to the public. This information is obtained in the process of serving you and comes from the following sources:

> • Information we receive from you on applications or other forms  
>  • Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others  
>  • Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency

We restrict access to non-public personal information about you to those employees whom we determine need the information to provide products or service to you. In addition to restricting access to customer information, we also maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable legal standards to keep your information private and secure. 

  
July 2002. This covenant supersedes any previous privacy statement issued. We reserve the right to change our privacy policy.
