**[](http://cni.lacasting.com.trunk.dev/wsdl/webservice.svc/GetCurrentPolicy?siteId=LA&policyType=Talent%20Terms%20Of%20Use "privacypolicy")CASTING NETWORKS PRIVACY POLICY**

**Effective Date: April 8, 2014**

**I. ACCEPTANCE OF PRIVACY POLICY AND SPECIAL NOTICES**

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the [Terms of Use found here](http://cni.lacasting.com/wsdl/webservice.svc/GetCurrentPolicy?siteId=LA&policyType=Talent%20Terms%20Of%20Use) (“Terms”). Each time that you access or use the CNI Applications, you signify that you agree to be bound by the Terms and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the Terms and the terms of this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue accessing the Services available through the CNI Applications. 

The CNI Applications and related Services provide a range of content hosting and communication services to actors, models, dancers, voice-over actors and other artists (collectively, “Talent”), connecting Talent with agents and managers (“Talent Representatives”), casting directors (“Casting Directors”), and other professionals rendering services in motion picture, theatrical, radio, television and other entertainment enterprises (collectively, “Industry Professionals”). 

**Special Notice To Talent**

There are practical considerations relating to the need for Industry Professionals to review certain personal information and to contact Talent for casting purposes.  By registering and creating a personal or represented profile (“Profile”) which will be accessible on the CNI Applications, you understand that you are affirmatively choosing to provide and post personal information about yourself including, but not limited to, images, video, audio, your real and/or stage name, sizes and stats, skills, gender, ethnical appearance, address, and phone number.  You further acknowledge and agree that such personal information may be accessible to other registered members of the Casting Networks Services, who may be able to personally identify and locate you, and that you are aware of any and all risks inherent in so doing. Your information may also be viewable outside of the CNI Applications via web search engines, which are outside of our control.  

**Special Note About Minors**

We are very concerned about the safety and privacy of all of our members, particularly individuals under the age of 18 (“Minors”). We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children under the age of 14, nor do we allow users between 14 and 17 to directly establish their own Profiles on the Sites.  As explained further in our [Terms](http://cni.lacasting.com/wsdl/webservice.svc/GetCurrentPolicy?siteId=LA&policyType=Talent%20Terms%20Of%20Use), users between 14 and 17 may only open an account or create a Profile if they are represented by an adult agent or other authorized Talent Representative, or by a parent or legal guardian who has registered on their behalf and who maintains the Profile on their behalf (the “Registering Adult”).  We reserve the right at any time to require verification of a Registering Adult and evidence of the Registering Adult's relationship with any Minor.  If we become aware that an account has been established for a Minor without a Registering Adult's permission and supervision, we will take steps to terminate the account and remove any corresponding information. 

**Special Note About Talent Scout®**

If you have a personal Profile, you may opt-in to allow your Profile to be searchable by Talent Representatives so that you may be scouted for representation (this functionality herein known as “Talent Scout®”).  To opt-in to Talent Scout®, click on “Representation” under your Profile preferences and select the type(s) of representation you are seeking.  You may opt out of Talent Scout® at any time by changing your Talent Scout® preference to “Not Seeking Representation.”  Casting Networks has no control over how Talent Representatives use your information.

**Privacy Policy Updates  
**

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any revisions to our Privacy Policy will be posted here with the "Effective Date" identified at the top of the policy. Any revised policy will supersede and replace previous privacy policies, effective as of the date on which it is posted. You should check the Sites frequently for updates. We reserve the right to require that you affirmatively accept any updated privacy policy, but your use of the CNI Applications after any revised Privacy Policy has been posted represents and confirms your consent and agreement to all such changes. If you do not agree to any of the new terms, please discontinue using the CNI Applications.

**II. INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

**Information Obtained Directly From You**

You can browse some areas of the CNI Applications without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information (i.e., name, email address, phone number, mobile telephone number, credit card information, and Profile or contact information) about yourself.  If you (or someone you have expressly authorized to act on your behalf such as your Talent Representative, or, if you are under 18, the Registering Adult) create a Profile or purchase any paid services, you choose to give us your personal information.  When you register for an account and create a Profile, use our Services, make a purchase, or otherwise engage with the CNI Applications, you or your authorized Talent Representative or Registering Adult may provide certain non-public information to create your Profile or provide billing information (e.g., credit or debit card information, name and billing address). It is indicated on the CNI Applications whether any personal or demographic data must be provided for you to access and use the requested service.

For security purposes, we ask that you do not enter financial information into your Profile except in the fields provided for that information and advise that you do not put sensitive information such as social security numbers, national identification numbers, or any state, or other local identification numbers in any Profile or on any document posted online.

**Information To Respond To Your Requests**

You may give us your personal information so we can send you communications you request. Details of how you can opt-out of receiving any promotional communications from us are detailed in the section headed Offers and Promotional Messages. 

**Content You Post   **

Many of the CNI Applications are designed to enable you to communicate with others and any information or content you post when participating with the CNI Applications becomes available to other registered members of our Services, depending upon the Service you are accessing, and is subject to redistribution by those registered members.  There is no expectation of privacy when posting content or otherwise participating in such interactive forumsand we have no control over how those users may use the information you make public.  Therefore, you should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a posting.

**Mobile Information**

We may collect additional information from you if you access the CNI Applications through a mobile device such as you device’s unique identifier, operating system, or mobile carrier.

We may also collect your location or GPS/Geo-location if you opt-in for us to do so.

**Information Collected Through Tracking Technology   **

In addition to any personal or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our business partners may use a variety of tracking technologies including cookies, web beacons/GIFs, embedded scripts, e-tags, browser caching, and web logs (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) that automatically or passively collect certain information from your computer, mobile, or other access device (“Device”) whenever you visit or interact with the CNI Applications. We may collect your operating system type or Device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, the language your system uses and the region and country and time zone of your Device (“Region Location”), unique IP address or Device identifier ("Device Identifier") and information about the website you were visiting before you came to the CNI Applications and the website you visit after you leave our CNI Applications, if this information is supplied to us by your browser (collectively, “Usage Information”). 

We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:

**Operationally Necessary**

We may use Tracking Technologies when required for system administration, or to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security, and allow you to make use of our Sites’ functionalities. 

**Performance-Related**

We may use Tracking Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including, as part of our analytic practices, to improve the content offered through the Services.

**Functionality-Related                                                                 **

We may use Tracking Technologies to tell us whether you have visited the Sites before or help us identify the features in which you may have the greatest interest. 

Keep in mind that certain features of our Services are only available through the use of Tracking Technologies.

You may also encounter Tracking Technologies from our third party service providers that we have allowed on CNI Applications to assist us with analyzing how our members use our services and with information about your interests from your viewing of other sites and applications. The service providers we use will be identified here.

You also may encounter third party Tracking Technologies from links contained on certain pages of our Sites that we do not control and have not authorized. (For example, if you view a photographer’s web page by clicking on an ad in the Photographer’s Gallery, there may be a cookie placed by that web page).

We may also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and/or connection information. During some visits, we may use software tools to measure and collect session information including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages, and page interaction information.

Our goal is to collect and use only the information that we think is required for our legitimate business interests, to better understand your interests, and to improve your experience using the CNI Applications. 

**Notice Regarding Geo-location Functionality**

Information gathered from your use of the CNI Applications may be combined with information from third party sources to identify your location by state and region.  More specific information about your geographic location may be collected for some of our mobile CNI Applications, which have search functionality to enable you to opt in to our collecting information about your precise location (“Geo-location”).  If you agree to have your Geo-location collected, we will only maintain your Geo-location information to facilitate your search.  In addition, when you have GPS/Geo-location software running on your Device, we may collect that information as controlled by the privacy settings on your Device.

**Contacting Us**

When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our Services or provide any contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you about our Services using the contact information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you.  This means we may contact you by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.

**Information From Other Sources**

The information we collect may be combined with information from other sources (e.g., demographic information, navigation information, additional contact information) that we have acquired in accordance with the law.

**III. HOW WE USE OR SHARE YOUR INFORMATION**

**How We Use Your Information**

We may use the information you give to us:

·       To allow you to register for an account and create a Profile

·       To respond to your requests

·       To customize your experience and improve our Services

·       For internal business use

·       For other reasons which we’ll explain to you when you provide the information

·       As otherwise explained in this Privacy Policy

**Database Services**

The CNI Applications are designed for networking, which enables registered members to see your Profile and to contact you through the CNI Applications.  Therefore, information in your Profile may be visible to Casting Directors who are searching the database or Talent Representatives who are scouting for talent or searching their own talent accounts.  Please remember that information you disclose while participating in our Services may be accessed, used, and stored by other registered members. We attempt to limit access to our searchable database to members who we expect are legitimate industry professionals, but we do not do background checks of our members and cannot guarantee who might gain access to the CNI Applications nor do we have control over how those users may use your personal information. Therefore, there is no expectation of privacy when posting, or otherwise participating in the Database Services.  You may change or cancel your account at any time or make your Profile prospectively inaccessible to other registered members by following the instructions in the section, “Choice And Opt-out”.

We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with our Database Services. We reserve the right to take action in connection with any content we deem to be inappropriate.  Please review our [Terms](http://cni.lacasting.com/wsdl/webservice.svc/GetCurrentPolicy?siteId=LA&policyType=Talent%20Terms%20Of%20Use) for more information regarding your appropriate use of the CNI Applications.  

**Online Resumes/Model Cards**

You may create a direct URL link to your online resume or model card by logging in to your account and clicking “Resume Link” from the Resume drop-down menu.  Creating a direct URL link to your online resume or model card will make your Profile accessible to third parties outside of the CNI Applications with whom you have shared the link with and via web search engines, which are outside of our control.  

**Aggregate and Analyze Non-Personal Information**

We use aggregate information about our users and non-personal information to analyze the CNIApplications and user behavior and prepare aggregated reports, which we may share with third parties.

**Communicate With You and Third Parties at Your Request**

We use your information to contact you to maintain your account, to comply with your stated communication preferences and to provide other Services requested by you, as described at the time when we collect the information from you, or to contact you for other purposes authorized by law.

When you access the Sites on a mobile device, we may use the information collected for any purpose set forth in this Privacy Policy.  For example, we may use this information to provide you with Regional Location-based services, such as locally based search results, and other personalized content. If you access the CNI Applications through a mobile device or app, we may also share your information with mobile carriers, operating systems and platforms.

**Legal Matters; Safety**

We may need to disclose your personal information to comply with applicable laws, legal processes, and/or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims or governmental requests or as needed to support auditing, compliance and governance functions. Because Casting Networks is a U.S. company and information collected on our CNI Applications is stored in whole or in part in the United States, your information may become subject to U.S. law. We may also disclose information when we believe, in our sole discretion, such disclosure is necessary or appropriate in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, to enforce our [Terms](http://cni.lacasting.com/wsdl/webservice.svc/GetCurrentPolicy?siteId=LA&policyType=Talent%20Terms%20Of%20Use), or as otherwise required by law.

If CNI is sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, personal information of our users may be one of the assets sold or merged in connection with that transaction. Information about our users may also need to be disclosed in connection with a commercial transaction where we, or any one of our businesses are seeking financing, investment, and support or funding.

**Security**

Casting Networks uses a third party to process its credit card payment transactions.

**A Note to International Users**

The CNI Applications are operated and maintained by Casting Networks, Inc., whose address is listed below. If you are visiting the CNI Applications from outside of the United States, please be advised that your information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated.   Data protection laws and other laws in the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.  By providing us with personal information and using our services, you consent to having your personal information transferred to and processed in our U.S. facilities, and to those third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Disputes**

If you choose to visit the CNI Applications, any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our [Terms](http://cni.lacasting.com/wsdl/webservice.svc/GetCurrentPolicy?siteId=LA&policyType=Talent%20Terms%20Of%20Use) including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the laws.

  ** _APPENDIX_**

**1\. Tracking Technologies We May Use**

**Cookies**  

A cookie is a data file placed on a device when it is used to visit the Sites.  We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes and to make it easier to navigate the Sites.  Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives.  We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.”  Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Sites and expire when the user closes his/her browser.  Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Sites easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information.  Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next.  Flash cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built into or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.  Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.  Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. 

**Web Beacons/GIFS**

Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as 1×1 GIF, tracking pixel, pixel tag, or clear GIF) may be included in our web pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. 

**Embedded Scripts**

An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the CNI Applications, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded from our web servers or a third party service provider onto the device you use to access the CNI Applications and, is active only while you are connected to the Sites. The embedded script is deactivated or deleted thereafter. 

**E-tags, Browser Caching, and Web Logs   **

Like most standard web servers, our servers may log the IP address (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) of the computer, or the device identifier of the mobile device that you used to access the CNI Applications in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the CNI Applications.  We may also track your movement within the CNI Applications to gauge your usage and browsing habits, and gather other information such as the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our CNI Applications, and the operating system of your computer.

We use this information in the aggregate to:

·       gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of the CNI Applications 

·       track information for statistical purposes 

·       help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions

·       analyze trends 

·       track user movement

·       gather broad demographic information 

We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.

**HTML5**

We use HTML5 in some of our applications, including in our mobile applications for the iPhone, iPad, and Android devices.  HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.  Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser “cookies” file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites.  To our knowledge, there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage. 

**2\. THIRD PARTY TRACKING TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS**

**Effective Date: April 8, 2014**
