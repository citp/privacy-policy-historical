The Services are directed to a general audience. We restrict registration for all our Services to individuals age 18 and above (or the age of majority, as determined by the laws of the state in which you reside, whichever is older).

Each agency, management company and/or individual agent and/or manager engaged by the agency or management company to act on behalf of the Talent (“Talent Representative”), and parents or legal guardians of Minors (collectively referred to as “Authorized Representative”), represent that the Authorized Representative is legally authorized to represent the Talent in connection with the Services and utilize all aspects of the applicable Services on behalf of the Talent, in accordance this Privacy Policy. Authorized Representatives agree to stop using the Services immediately when such authority from Talent is no longer effective. We are not obligated but reserve the right at any time to require evidence of an Authorized Representative’s authority to enter into this Privacy Policy, and act on behalf of Talent in connection with the applicable Services. If we become aware that someone other than an Authorized Representative has established, edited or otherwise modified in any way an Account Profile or Resume for a Talent, we will take steps to terminate the account and remove any corresponding information within our control.

That site may request cookies or use tracking devices.

**5\. HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION**

How We Process Database Information About You

The Services are designed for networking, which enable Industry Professionals to search for you, view your Resume, and to contact you or your Authorized Representative.

We attempt to limit access to our searchable database to legitimate Industry Professionals, but we do not do background checks of our members and cannot guarantee who might gain access to the Services. Nor do we have control over how those users may use your personal information. Therefore, there is no expectation of privacy when posting, or otherwise participating in the database Services.

We have no control over what others may post or how those users may use the information. Therefore, you should exercise caution and discretion when using our Services or allowing your Authorized Representative to participate on your behalf.

EXAMPLES OF TRACKING TOOLS 

Cookies

A cookie is a data file placed on a device when the device is used to visit the Services. We use cookies to collect information for record-keeping purposes and to make it easier to navigate the Services. Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives. We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Services and expire when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Services easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next. Cookies may be used for many purposes including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Every browser is a little different, so refer to your browser’s Help menu for the correct way to modify your cookies. However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click here. If you choose to disable cookies on your device, some features of the Services may not function properly.

Web Beacons/GIFS

Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Services, to monitor how users navigate the Services, to count how many sent e-mails were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.

Embedded Scripts

An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code downloads temporarily onto the device you use to access Services from our web server or third-party service provider. It is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted after that.

HTML 5

We may use HTML5 in some of our Services, including in our mobile website. HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser “cookies” file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites. To our knowledge, there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.

E-tags, Cache Browsers, and Web Logs

Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and device identifier to improve security, analyze trends, and administer the Services. We may track your movement within the Services, the pages from which you were referred, access times, and browser types. This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our Services, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or device identifier of the mobile device that you used to access our Services, and usage and browsing habits. We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our Services, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.
