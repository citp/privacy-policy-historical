        <li>This policy covers how Casino City treats personal information that 
          Casino City collects and receives, including information related to 
          your past use of Casino City products and services. Personal information 
          is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name,

        </li><li>This policy applies only to information gathered during your use of 
          products and services provided by the Casino City Network of websites.<br>
        </li><li> This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Casino 
          City does not own or control, or to people that Casino City does not 
          employ or manage. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Information Collection and Use </h2>

          in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. 
        </li><li>Casino City collects information about your transactions with us and 
          with some of our business partners.<br>
        </li><li>Casino City automatically receives and records information on our 
          server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Casino City 
          cookie information, and the page you request. <br>
        </li><li>Casino City uses information for the following general purposes: to 
          customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests 
          for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct 
          research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external 
          clients. <br>
      </li></ul><p></p>
      <p><strong>Children</strong> 
       </p><ul class="goldBlt">
			 <li>

      </li></ul>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <ul class="goldBlt">
        <li>Casino City does not rent, sell, or share personal information about

                right to share this information. 
            </li><li> 
              We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to 
                establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal 
                claims; 
            </li><li> 
              We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, 
                prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected
