Destination XL Group, Inc. ("DXL") recognizes your concerns regarding the collection and use of personal information, and we want our visitors to know that DXL has taken important steps to safeguard your privacy and security. This Privacy Statement describes the information that we collect about you, why we collect it, how we use it, the instances when we share it with third-parties and the measures we employ to protect such information and provide you with the safest and most secure shopping environment possible.

While this Privacy Statement applies primarily to our online and wireless service practices, certain practices including, but not limited to, the collection, use, and sharing of information with others, may be applicable and extend to our offline practices. By shopping in our stores, through our promotional mailers, wireless service, or visiting DestinationXL.com, you agree to accept the practices described in this Privacy Statement.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

**Automatic Information:**

When you visit DestinationXL.com, our server attaches a small text file, known as a "cookie", to your computer's hard drive which will automatically collect and store non-personally identifiable information such as the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using, the browser software you use and your operating system, the date and time you access our website, and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our website, if any. This information collected by using a cookie is sometimes called "clickstream". This is the only information collected unless you voluntarily provide information to us.

We use clickstream information, which we may share with our affiliates, licensees, trusted vendors or responsible outside companies, only as anonymous aggregate data to determine the number of visitors to our website, to understand how visitors navigate our website, to determine common traffic patterns, including what site the visitor came from, to ensure that the website is working properly and to improve the design and content of our website. This aggregate information does not include individual names or personal information, so it does not identify you or anyone else.
