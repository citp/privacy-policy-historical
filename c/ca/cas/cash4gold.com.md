## 1.         General.

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to inform you about the type of information that C4G Holdings LLC (“we,” “us,” or “our” ) may gather about or collect from you in connection with your use of this site (this “Site”).  It also is intended to explain the conditions under which we use and disclose that information, and your rights in relation to that information.  
The procedures for modifying or changing this Privacy Policy in the future are discussed in Section 6 of this document.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, you should first contact [Info@cash4gold.com](mailto:info@cash4gold.com).  


## 2.         Children

This Site is not intended for children under 18 years of age.  We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18.

## 3.         Gathering, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information

We collect both Non-Personally-Identifying Information and Personally-Identifying Information from you.  “Non–Personally–Identifying Information” is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity.  “Personally–Identifying Information,” by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person or entity.

#### A.         Gathering Non-Personally-Identifying Information

(i)         Web Browsers  
Like most site operators, we gather Non-Personally-Identifying Information from you of the sort that web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available.  That information includes your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, operating system and browser type, and the locations of the web pages you view right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving this Site.  
(ii)        Web Cookies  
A “Web Cookie” is a string of information that a site stores on a computer, and  your browser provides to this Site each time you submit a query to the site.  We use Web Cookies to track the pages that you visit during each Site session, both to help us improve your experience and to help us understand how this Site is being used. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSER TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THIS SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THIS SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE WEB COOKIES , YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.  
(iii)       Web Beacons  
We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.” 

You may not decline Web Beacons.  However, they may be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.  Please note, however, that this only renders Web Beacons ineffective on this Site; Web Beacons in email communications cannot be rendered ineffective.  
(iv)       Third Parties’ Use of Web Beacons and Web Cookies  
This Site may include third-party advertising, links to other sites, and other content from third party businesses. The content posted by these parties will be reasonably identifiable as coming from a third party. These third-party sites, businesses, and advertisers, or advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use Web Beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and Web Cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, personalize or optimize advertising content and to track users who link from their respective sites to this Site, but this third party technology does not permit them to access your Personal Information. We do not have access to or control over Web Beacons or Web Cookies that these third parties may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites or businesses are not covered by this Privacy Policy but are covered by their respective privacy policies as is described in more detail in Section 5 below.

#### B.         Use of Non-Personally-Identifying Information

We analyze Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from users of this Site to help us better understand how this Site is being used.  By identifying patterns and trends in usage, we are able to better design this Site to improve your experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. 

#### C.         Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information

From time to time, we may also release the Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from Site users in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of this Site.

## 4.         Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personally–Identifying Information

As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity.  We will only collect Personally-Identifying Information that you knowingly submit to us.  We will not disclose Personally-Identifying Information to third parties unless we obtain your permission to do so at the time we collect it, except as set forth below:
