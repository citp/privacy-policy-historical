When you register we ask for information such as your name, address, phone number, email address and zip code. Once you register with C4G and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. C4G automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address C4G cookie information, and the page you request.

**Cookies  
**   
C4G may set and access C4G cookies on your computer. We use this information for Web Site and Systems Administration. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features and storage of items between visits.   
 

**Tracking  
**   
We use a common technology known as a "Clear GIF" or "1-by-1 Pixel" on the Site and in e-mail communications with users. A Clear GIF, or "graphic interface format" is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1x1 pixel) that we (or our partners) place on a page of the Site. We may also occasionally place GIFs in e-mail messages that we send to users. GIFs, which do not contain personal information, provide us with important information about how users use the Site and respond to e-mail messages. With this information, we are better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative e-mail presentations. We may also allow our advertisers and promotional partners the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely to track users who link from their respective sites to this Site, but this ability to track such activity does not allow these entities access to user personal information.

We transfer information about you if C4G is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, C4G will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, and providing customer service.
