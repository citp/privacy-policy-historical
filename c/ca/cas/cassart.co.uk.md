# Privacy Policy | Cass Art

Cass Art complies fully with all relevant Data Protection and consumer legislation, and treats all personal information as fully confidential. We collect your personal information (for example, your name, email address etc) when you subscribe to our mailing list, enter competitions and provide feedback; when you place orders, we collect your name, email and delivery address and payment details, to service your order. Personal information is stored on secure servers, and details such as credit card, name and address are encrypted. Cass Art complies with Tier 1 PCI (Payment Card Industry), which guarantees the highest level of security and protection of customer information.

Cass Art will not share your details with third parties unless you give us permission to do so. However, to perform credit-card transactions and fulfill orders, Cass Art uses reputable third-party banking and distribution institutions. These carefully selected companies receive only the information needed to verify and authorise payment cards and to process orders, and are under strict legal obligations to keep all personal information private. In the interests of monitoring and improving our service, customers will receive an email from Ekomi asking you to review your experience shopping with us.
