We work with carefully selected third parties who are responsible for delivering certain functions on our behalf.  These include companies that run our website, process payments, deliver e-mails, deliver orders and manage our loyalty scheme.  When we share personal data with these providers we require them to keep it safe and not keep it for any longer than they need to in order to perform their responsibilities.
