CashX must adhere to the defined KYC requirements of these regulations.<br><br><b>2.</b>	When a Customer uses CashX’s Services via their online bank, CashX relies upon the bank to validate the Customer via passwords, PINs and dynamic tokens as the Customer interacts with the bank’s online service.<br><br><b>3.</b>	It is CashX’s responsibility to verify the identity of the Customer prior to using the CashX Services so that the following standards are met. CashX should obtain the following information in relation to the Customer:<br>
•	Full Name<br>

The standard level of ID verification is:<br>
•	one match on an individual’s full name and current address; and<br>
•	a second match on an individual’s full name and either their current address or their date of birth.<br> Acceptable documents for ID verification that you may scan and submitt to us are as follows:<br>
