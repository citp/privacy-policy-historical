# Privacy Policy

**Overview**

We at 77Blue LLC, owner and operator of the Cashbaq Web site located at [www.cashbaq.com](http://www.cashbaq.com/), take privacy very seriously, and have written this Privacy Policy to clearly communicate (a) the type of personal information collected from users; (b) why this information is collected; and (c) who will have access to this information. Furthermore we want to emphasize that we take every precaution in protecting this information, and that we do not share this information with third parties.

Frankly, we don’t want your information but in order to provide you with the service, we have to take it. We require you to give as little information as possible. To sign up, all we need is your e-mail address and a password. We require an e-mail address so we can verify that you wanted to sign up. If you sign up for favorite merchants or save coupons or products, we will send you notification e-mails. As a member, you can opt out from receiving our e-mails at any time. As a member, you may opt out of receiving any newsletter or correspondence at any time by following the link provided at the bottom of each newsletter, or by changing your preferences in the [Account Information](http://www.cashbaq.com/accountinfo.php) section of Cashbaq. You will need your Cashbaq password to change your e-mail preferences.

T>he only reason you have to give us your mailing address is to get paid. If you do not want to give us your mailing address, you can sign up to receive payment via Paypal. Using Paypal, all that we need is your e-mail address. Paypal returns your name to us after we send you a payment.

If you submit a user review on the site, we request your name (first and last) and location (city and state). If you choose to submit that information, it may be displayed on Cashbaq and on other sites owned by Cashbaq’s parent company.

If you use a blog or bulletin board on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

Things we hate as much as you do: We hate SPAM. We hate junk mail. We hate telemarketers calling us at dinner… OK, so we hate telemarketers calling us any time. We’re not going to subject you to any of that ourselves or by selling your information to someone who will. We won’t sell your information to anyone and are committed to keeping your private information private.

| **Cashbaq is a proud member of TRUSTe** Cashbaq is a licensee of the TRUSTe Web Privacy Seal Program.

**What type of information do we collect?** 77Blue may collect any or all of the following two types of information: (a) Personally Identifiable Information and (b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personally Identifiable Information is requested when you register with us, fill out surveys, participate in a contest or special offer, correspond with us, or otherwise volunteer information. Personally Identifiable Information might include your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address and other identification and contact information.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon how you navigate through our Site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.

**Do we use cookies?** A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on Cashbaq and link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. We set a persistent cookie to keep you logged in if you choose to do so by checking the box “Remember me”. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as favorite stores.

Some of our business partners (e.g. analytics) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Cashbaq only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

**Why do we collect this information?** Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide our users and members with a superior online experience. We collect Personally Identifiable Information to both credit your purchases through Cashbaq to your account, and to send rebate checks to your address. For members that elect to personalize their experience at Cashbaq, we use Personally Identifiable Information to provide that look and feel during their visits or to send e-mail regarding new coupons or cash back opportunities. Members can always choose to opt-out of any customization. We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information to continuously improve the content and navigation of our Web site.

Who will have access to this information? Any information gathered by 77Blue is solely for our own use. We do not share this information with any third-party, and only a limited number of 77Blue employees have access to this information. We will not sell your information.

Please note that when you leave the Cashbaq site to shop at one of our merchant partners or advertisers, you are dealing with another company, not Cashbaq. This means that you enter into a relationship with that company / Web site separately from Cashbaq. Any information you share with that merchant or advertiser is subject to their policies and practices, not to Cashbaq’s policies or practices. Users are encouraged to read the privacy policies of our merchant partners.

You can earn a bonus through our referral program when you refer new shoppers to Cashbaq through your personalized Refer-a-Friend links. If you join through such a link, your name may be revealed to your referrer only if you give permission during registration. In addition, the member who referred you will see a monthly total of the bonus they earn from referred friends. This information is reported to them only in aggregate and neither your name nor the stores where you shop will be revealed to them. No other information is shared or revealed with the individual who referred you, or with any other party. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about Cashbaq, we may ask you for your friend's name and e-mail address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time e-mail inviting him or her to visit Cashbaq. Cashbaq stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may [contact us](http://www.cashbaq.com/contactus.php) to request that we remove this information from our database.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

**Is this information secure?** To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, 77Blue has put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information it collects online. However, data security is a constantly evolving art and science. You should consider any communication that you transmit to 77Blue (such as data, questions or answers, comments, or suggestions) as non-confidential, and agree that 77Blue will not be liable or responsible if information that belongs to you is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient.

**Does 77Blue collect personally identifying information from or about children?** 77Blue uses reasonable efforts not to collect, use or disclose individually identifiable information from children under the age of 13. The Services are not targeted at children, and children may not register for any portions of the Services that require registration.

**How can I access or correct any personally identifying information about me?** Members can view and change their personal information at any time online. To do so, login to [your Cashbaq account](http://www.cashbaq.com/myaccount.php).

**Will this policy be updated?** While we may have to make updates to this policy, we are not going to change our commitment to protect your privacy. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.

**How do I find out more about 77Blue's information practices?** If you have any questions about anything in this Privacy Policy, or about collection of Personally Identifiable Information, or information generally, please contact 77Blue as follows:
