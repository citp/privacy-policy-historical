 **Cookies  
** A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web site's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. 

The Casale Media® Online Advertising Network uses cookies for the purpose of tracking when an Internet user has seen an advertisement. These cookies do not and can not provide Casale Media® with any Personally Identifiable information about an Internet user. These cookies serve two purposes:

  1. They are used to inform the Casale Media® Online Advertising Network whether or not an advertisement has been served to the same computer before, and if so, when the advertisement was served. These cookies are **not** used by Casale Media® to build a profile of a user's behaviour **nor** are they used by Casale Media® for the purposes of behavioural tracking or behavioural targeting. Casale Media® is one of the few online advertising networks that do **not** engage in the practice of behavioural targeting.
  2. They are used to facilitate retargeting at a campaign level. Retargeting occurs within the confines of a user-to-advertiser relationship, and is not available for general targeting on the network.

**Collection and Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information  
** All information shared with both advertisers and publishers within the Casale Media® online advertising network is done so in an aggregate fashion. This allows us to provide members of the advertising network with broad percentages regarding the users who are receiving advertisements through the network. However, this data is not linked to any form of Personally Identifiable information. 

Information collected by advertisers on their websites who are members of the Casale Media® online advertising network may contain Personally Identifiable information. However, data such as this is provided by the individual Internet user in the form of online order forms, contests, or otherwise through the members website, not casalemedia.com. This Personally Identifiable information collected outside the Casale Media® Online Advertising Network is subject to the privacy policies of the individual advertisers involved. 

The Casale Media® Online Advertising Network prides itself on providing an atmosphere that is non-disruptive to Internet users. Our proprietary targeting methodologies enable advertisers to effectively target their campaigns to the audience(s) they are looking to reach without engaging in profiling practices. 

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. Log file data may be retained for up to a maximum period of fifteen months.

** Registering to become a member of the Casale Media® online advertising network, either as an advertiser or a publisher, requires the submission of Personally Identifiable information to our company. This can include your full name, mailing and/or billing address, email address, company name, and website URL. We use this information to service your accounts and respond to inquiries. Communications to our business users are related to the Advertising Network. We hold all such information submitted in strict confidence. Under no circumstances will a user's email address, mailing address, phone number, or other Personally Identifiable information be sold to, supplied to, or otherwise made available to any third party. For registered members to update or correct their personal information reach us through the "Contact Us" page. 

**Security  
** We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
