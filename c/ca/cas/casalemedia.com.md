 **Cookies  
** A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web site's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. 

The Casale Media Online Advertising Network uses cookies for the purposes of tracking when an Internet user has seen an advertisement. These cookies do not and will not provide Casale Media with any Personally Identifiable information. Instead, these cookies are used to inform the Casale Media Online Advertising Network if an advertisement has been served to the same computer before, and if so, when the advertisement was served. 

We use both session and persistent cookies on our website. These are needed for site navigation and aggregate analysis of what is viewed on our site. 

**Opt-Out  
** Internet users have the option to block the use of cookies by changing an Internet browser setting. In addition, users have the option to block the use of JavaScript, which is used by the Casale Media Online Advertising Network to display advertisements. For more information, please see the documentation regarding your Internet browser. 

**Collection and Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information  
** All information shared with both advertisers and publishers within the Casale Media online advertising network is done so in an aggregate fashion. This allows us to provide members of the advertising network with broad percentages regarding the users who are receiving advertisements through the network. However, this data is not linked to any form of Personally Identifiable information. 

Information collected by advertisers on their websites who are members of the Casale Media online advertising network may contain Personally Identifiable information. However, data such as this is provided by the individual Internet user in the form of online order forms, contests, or otherwise through the members website, not casalemedia.com. This Personally Identifiable information collected outside the Casale Media Online Advertising Network is subject to the privacy policies of the individual advertisers involved. 

The Casale Media Online Advertising Network prides itself on providing an atmosphere that is non-disruptive to Internet users. Our proprietary targeting methodologies enable advertisers to effectively target their campaigns to the audience(s) they are looking to reach without engaging in profiling practices, which invade the privacy of Internet users. 

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information  
** Registering to become a member of the Casale Media online advertising network, either as an advertiser or a publisher, requires the submission of Personally Identifiable information to our company. This can include your full name, mailing and/or billing address, email address, company name, and website URL. We use this information to service your accounts and respond to inquiries. Communications to our business users are related to the Advertising Network. We hold all such information submitted in strict confidence. Under no circumstances will a user's email address, mailing address, phone number, or other Personally Identifiable information be sold to, supplied to, or otherwise made available to any third party. For registered members to update or correct their personal information reach us through the "Contact Us" page. 

**Changes to This Privacy Policy  
** Casale Media may find it necessary to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted at this site. Except as otherwise required by law, any modifications made to this Privacy Policy will not materially affect the privacy of data collected by Casale Media prior to the effective date of the policy change.
