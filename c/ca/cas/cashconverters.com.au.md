#### Advertising & Performance Tracking

We use several advertising companies to devise and deliver our online advertising. This often involves serving banner advertisements on third party websites.

When you see one of our advertisements on a third party website, cookies and, in some cases, Spotlight tags are sometimes used to collect information such as:

  * the server your computer is logged on to; and
  * your browser type; and
  * the date and time of your visit; and
  * the performance of their marketing efforts.



When you visit our websites directly or after seeing one of our advertisements on a third party website, anonymous information is collected on how you use our website. This might include which pages you view, and whether your start and complete an online application. The tracking companies aggregate all the captured information and use it to study internet user behaviour patterns.

They do not include personal information in their studies and use the data mainly to measure advertising effectiveness and relative consumer interest in the various areas of our websites. No personal information is collected during this process. If, however, any information is automatically collected, the tracking companies are required under their arrangements with us to maintain the privacy and confidentiality of that personal information.

We may disclose the information collected, in an aggregate form only, to third parties including advertisers or potential advertisers.
