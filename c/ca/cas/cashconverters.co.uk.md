We are Cash Converters (UK) Limited, a company registered in England and Wales with company number 03096334. Our registered office is Cash Converters (UK) Ltd, Innovation House, Aston Lane South, Preston Brook, WA7 3FY.

#### About this Policy

This privacy policy applies to any use we make of your personal details collected by us, whether through this website or as a result of your use of this website, or when you otherwise apply for or use any of our products and services, including any application you make for a loan (whether or not successful) through our website [www.cashconverters.co.uk](http://cashconverters.co.uk/ "Cash Converters UK") or otherwise.

This Privacy Policy explains our commitment to protecting your information and privacy. It also explains how we use the information you provide to us when you visit our website or when you contact us or use our products and services.

Please read this Privacy Policy before submitting any information about yourself to us. By providing us with details, whether through the website or otherwise, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

#### Definitions

In this Privacy Policy, **Personal Information** means any information about you from which you can be personally identified and which relates to you. This may include your name, address, email address, home telephone number and mobile phone number, work address, work e-mail address and telephone number, your age and date of birth, your employment status, your country of residence and nationality, names and contact telephone numbers for any alternative contacts that you provide to us, financial details (including details of any benefits), username, password and other information which you may disclose to us. In certain circumstances, we may also be provided with limited health information, such as details of any physical or mental health issues or conditions which may affect how we communicate with you or your ability to make payments. Personal information about physical or mental health issues or conditions is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “ **sensitive personal information** ”. Where sensitive personal information is provided by you, this is processed by us on the basis that you have provided us with your express consent to the use of your sensitive personal information by us for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We may also collect details of your visits to the website including, but not limited to, domain name and shortened IP address, browser version, operating system, the URL you came from, the pages visited within the website, the URL to which you go upon leaving the website, and whether you return to our website.

By providing us with contact details for your place of employment, you confirm that we may contact you at work using the details provided.

#### Why we need your Personal Information

The main reason we use your Personal Information is to provide you with the products or services you have requested, to deal with your queries, or consider or process any loan or other application you make and to collect any payments when due. If you apply to us for a loan, we will collect some necessary Personal Information about you from other people, such as credit reference agencies and your employer so we can check details you have provided to us and your credit worthiness.

#### How we use your Personal Information

We may share your details with group and external service providers who help us to provide agreed services to you, such as website hosting providers or companies hosting consolidated customer databases. We may also share your details where necessary with other members of our group of companies and its franchisees where needed for management authorisations or approvals, to administer our systems, investigations or where they are involved in the financing or securing of arrangements you have requested.

For certain products, we will make searches about you at credit reference agencies who will supply us with credit information, for use in the assessment of credit products and other information, as well as information from the Electoral Register, for the purpose of verifying your identity. The agencies will record details of the search type, credit or identification, whether or not this application proceeds. We may use credit-scoring methods to assess this application and to verify your identity. We may also contact your employer to verify your employment status. Credit searches and other information which is provided to us and/or the credit reference agencies, about you and those with whom you are linked financially may be used by us and other companies if credit decisions are made about you, or other members of your household. Any of this information may also be used for identification purposes, debt tracing, debt recovery and the prevention of money laundering as well as the management of your account.

For certain products, we may make periodic searches of credit reference agencies to manage your account with us, to take decisions regarding credit, including whether to make credit available or to continue or extend existing credit. The searches will not be seen or used by lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit. Where you borrow or may borrow from us, we may give details of your account and how you manage it to credit reference agencies. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on-time, we may tell credit reference agencies who will record the outstanding debt. Please see Part 2 of this privacy policy for further details.  
We will retain information on unsuccessful or aborted applications for our products and services for up to six years following the application.

#### Further Uses

We may also use details to ask you to complete surveys about our website or services, unless you object, so that we can adjust and improve our services as necessary.  
We and other group companies and franchisees may also use your Personal Information:

    * to improve our products and services;
    * internal record keeping;
    * to communicate with you by e-mail, telephone, SMS or post, either regarding the services you have requested or other matters regarding transactions between you and us or your customer relationship with us;
    * to contact you by e-mail, telephone, SMS or post in order to share information with you about products, services and events from Cash Converters, other group companies and franchisees that may be of interest to you;
    * statistical analysis;
    * fraud prevention, prevention of money laundering and other unlawful activity;
    * debt collection and debt tracing including disclosure of your data to any person to whom your debt may be assigned;
    * to deal with internal administration, to train our advisors, to perform our contract terms and to enforce them, to monitor our performance and to improve our services and facilities, to exercise and defend legal rights and obligations, to deal with regulatory obligations and police / authority / regulator enquiries and investigations, to comply with legally binding requests for information, such as a court order, and to carry out audits;
    * if we undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party, in which case you agree that any Personal Information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or third party;
    * to the extent otherwise required or permitted by law.



We will not otherwise transfer, disclose, sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission to do so or are otherwise required or permitted to do so by law.

#### Direct Marketing and your Preferences

We may wish to provide you with information about new products, promotions, special offers of Cash Converters, group companies and franchisees and other information which may be of interest to you and invite you to take part in market research. This communication may occur by post, telephone, email or SMS (unless you have asked us not to do so). We will obtain your consent where we are required to do so in accordance with applicable law.

We will ensure that any direct marketing or market research that you receive or are contacted about by electronic means will provide a simple means for you to refuse further marketing. For example, in emails it may provide you with an ‘unsubscribe’ link, or an email address to which you can send an opt-out request. We will stop any marketing to which you object or withdraw your consent to within a reasonable period, in order to allow sufficient time for the change to be administered. You can change your mind at any time about marketing by informing us by telephone on 0800 1300 370. In such cases Cash Converters would not necessarily remove all your personal data from its database(s) but would note and respect your changed direct marketing preferences.

#### Third party personal information

If you provide personal information about someone else (such as an alternative contact) then you should not do so without their permission. By providing us with someone else’s personal information you confirm that you have their consent to do so. Where information is provided by you about someone else, or someone discloses information about you, it may be added to any personal information that is already held by us and it will be used in the ways described in this agreement.

#### Will my personal information be transferred abroad?

The personal information you provide to us is processed in the UK. It may be transferred to other group companies and to franchisees as described in previous paragraphs. Some of the companies to whom your personal information will be disclosed are located outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), in countries which do not provide the same level of protection to personal information (such as Australia and the United States). We will take steps to ensure that your personal information will be afforded the level of protection required of us under applicable data protection legislation and this notice.

#### How to get copies of or amend the information we collect

You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998 at any time. A small fee will be payable, currently £10. If you would like a copy of the information held about you please write to: Group Compliance Officer, Cash Converters UK Ltd, Innovation House, Aston Lane South, Preston Brook, WA7 3FY.

You have the right of access to your personal records held by credit and fraud agencies. If you would like to have details of the agencies we use please telephone us on 0800 1300 370.

### PART 2: CREDIT REFERENCING

#### General Information

If you apply for a loan from us, we will perform searches with credit reference agencies. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, we may tell credit reference agencies who will record the outstanding debt.

We will ask for your consent before passing details about you to any credit reference agencies. If you no not give us your consent, we will not proceed with your application.

The information below tells you about how credit reference agencies, Cash Converters  
and other lenders use your Personal Information.

**What is a credit reference agency?**  
Credit reference agencies (CRAs) collect and maintain information on consumers’ and businesses’ credit behaviour, on behalf of lenders in the UK.

**What is a fraud prevention agency?**  
Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPAs) collect, maintain and share information on known and suspected fraudulent activity. Some CRAs also act as FPAs.

**Why do you use them when I have applied to you?**  
Although you have applied to us and we will check our own records, we will also contact CRAs to get information on your credit behaviour with other organisations. This will help us make the best possible assessment of your overall situation before we make a decision.

**Where do they get information from?**  
Publicly available information sources such as

  * The Electoral Register at Local Authorities
  * County Court Judgments from Registry Trust
  * Bankruptcy information from the Insolvency Service
  * Fraud information from fraud prevention agencies
  * Credit information comes from information on applications to banks, building societies and credit card companies



**How will I know if my Personal Information is sent to a CRA or FPA?**  
You will be told when you apply for a loan if your data will be supplied. The next section tells you how, when and why we will search at CRAs and what we will do with the information we obtain from them. We will also tell you if we plan to send payment history information on you, if you have one, to CRAs. You can ask at any time for the name of the CRAs and FPAs we use.

**Why is my Personal Information used in this way?**  
We and other organisations want to make the best possible decisions we can, in order to make sure that you will be able to repay us. Some organisations may also use the information to check your identity. In this way we can ensure we all make responsible decisions. At the same time we also want to make decisions quickly and easily and, by using up to date information, provided electronically, we are able to make the most reliable and fair decisions possible.

**Who controls what CRAs can do with my Personal Information?**  
All organisations that collect and process personal data are regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998, overseen by Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). All credit reference agencies are in regular dialogue with the ICO. Use of the Electoral Register is controlled under the Representation of the People Act 2000.

**Can just anyone see my Personal Information held at CRAs?**  
No, access to your information is very strictly controlled and only those that are entitled to do so may see it. Usually that will only be with your agreement or if there is a legal requirement to do so.

#### Applying to us for a loan

We will search at credit reference agencies and at fraud prevention agencies for information on you and we will send the information you supply to us as part of the loan application to the credit reference agencies.

If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this and may also pass this information to financial and other organisations involved in fraud prevention to protect us, them and our respective customers from theft and fraud.

With the information we obtain from the credit reference agencies we will:

  * assess your application for credit
  * verify your identity
  * undertake checks for the prevention and detection of fraud and money laundering
  * undertake periodic statistical analysis or testing to ensure the accuracy of existing and future products and services



We may also use scoring methods to assess your application and to verify your identity. Any or all of these processes may be automated.

#### After you have a loan from us

Where you borrow or may borrow from us, we will give certain Personal Information about you to credit reference agencies. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, we will tell credit reference agencies. We may make periodic searches of our records, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to manage your loan with us, to take decisions regarding your identity and also credit, including whether to make credit available or to continue or extend existing credit.

If you have borrowed from us and do not make payments that you owe us, we will trace your whereabouts and recover payment. To help us do this, we may share your Personal Information with third parties who assist us with tracing, debt collection and debt enforcement.

#### About Credit Reference Agencies

When credit reference agencies receive a search from us they will place a search ‘footprint’ on your credit file whether or not this application proceeds. If the search was for a credit application the record of that search (but not the name of the organisation that carried it out) may be seen by other organisations when you apply for credit in the future.

The credit reference agencies will also supply us with:

  * credit information such as previous applications
  * public information such as County Court Judgments and bankruptcies
  * electoral register information
  * fraud prevention information



If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, credit reference agencies will record the outstanding debt. Records shared with credit reference agencies remain on file for 6 years after they are closed whether settled by you or defaulted.

#### How credit reference agencies use your Personal Information

The information which we, other organisations and fraud prevention agencies provide to the credit reference agencies about you may be supplied by credit reference agencies to other organisations and used by them to:

  * make decisions on credit
  * trace your whereabouts and recover payment if you do not make payments you owe
  * conduct checks for the prevention and detection of crime including fraud and money laundering
  * undertake statistical analysis and system testing



Your data may also be used for other purposes for which you give your specific permission or, in very limited circumstances, when required by law or where permitted under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998. Your data may also be used to offer you other products.

Credit references agencies will **NOT** use your Personal Information to create a blacklist or to make a decision.

#### Find out more

You can contact the 3 credit referencing agencies currently operating in the UK. They will charge you a small statutory fee for giving you a copy of your credit record.

  * CallCredit, Consumer Services Team, PO Box 491, Leeds, LS3 1WZ or call 0870 0601414
  * Equifax PLC, Credit File Advice Centre, PO Box 3001, Bradford, BD1 5US or call 0870 010 0583 or log on to www.myequifax.co.uk
  * Experian, Consumer Help Service, PO Box 8000, Nottingham NG80 7WF or call 0870 241 6212 or log on to www.experian.co.uk



If you have been refused credit you can get advice from your local Trading Standards Department, Citizens Advice Bureau or Consumer Advice Centre and the agencies’ web sites. The Information Commissioner also produces a useful leaflet entitled ‘Credit Explained’. You can obtain a free copy on the Commissioner’s website (www.ico.gov.uk) or by telephoning 0870 600 8100.

#### Fraud Prevention Agencies

We have systems that protect our customers and ourselves against fraud and other crime. Customer information can be used to prevent crime and trace those responsible. If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering.

We and other organisations may access and use the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies from other countries.
