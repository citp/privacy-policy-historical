If you have logged into the forum then we will retain details of your use of the forum.

Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to not only ensure our website works properly but to enable the various features and services you have asked to use. We use cookies for:

  * identifying you and tracking your preferences during that session, and
  * Keeping you logged into our forum
  * Allowing you to receive our push messages via your browser.



Where you have set your preferences in your browser for permitting or disallowing “cookies” then we will endeavour to honour that selection apart from where this would make our website inoperable and their use is temporary.

The transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data en route to us. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to guard against unauthorised access.

  * If you submit a complaint via our “Player Arbitration” complaint service, then you agree that we may use your personal data for resolving the dispute, which includes allowing us to share that personal data and information with the casino in question. You also agree to that casino providing us, in return, with any information it may hold about you which is relevant to the complaint. This may include information which is critical of you. This mutual agreement is also acknowledged and dealt with during the submission phase of the complaint.
  * To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have expressly consented to be contacted for such purposes.
  * To notify you about changes to our service.
