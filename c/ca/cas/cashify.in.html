                        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Cashify ("we" or "us") gathers and uses personal information submitted on our website <a href="http://www.Cashify.in" target="_blank">www.Cashify.in</a> (Cashify) or Cashify App on Android Playstore/ Apple Appstore . It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.</p>

                        <p>Cashify strives to give the best offers to sell your old gadget; then Cashify refers you to a buyer for your product. Cashify will share your personal information with these carefully selected buyers when you agree to submit for a quote. This means we do not take your credit card/debit card information and we do not take your money. Registration on Cashify is voluntary, if you do decide to register; we will not share your personal information until you agree to submit to a quote. You do get access to certain features if you register, but membership is not necessary to find sale offers. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us.</p>
                        <div class="tncHead mar-btm-10 mar-tp-10">Information We Collect</div>
                        <p>We collect standard information about Cashify users such as IP addresses, browser type, operating system, device type, what you searched for, referring and exit pages, the dates and times of visits, and other site usage behavior ("Site Visitation Data"). Site Visitation Data is used to administer the site and provide general statistics regarding the use of the Cashify. We may also use Site Visitation Data to display advertising or send targeted email marketing messages you may find interesting and to suppress advertising that might not interest you.</p>
                        <p>To help improve our site and services, we may collect certain technical information from your browser software, screen resolution and the website that referred you to us.</p>
                        <div class="tncHead mar-btm-10 mar-tp-10">Sharing information with friends and in user forums</div>
                        <p>The Cashify allows you to share certain information with friends that you select. Please bear in mind that Cashify cannot control what your friends do with the information you share with them, so you should only share with friends you trust. Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages, information that you share can be collected and used by others. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@Cashify.in">info@Cashify.in</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, if you participate in a user forum on the Cashify website, your comments and your Cashify username will be displayed to all Cashify users on the forum. Cashify is not responsible for what any user or third party may do with information that you choose to share.</p>
                        <p>We may also provide a feature allowing you to invite a friend to join Cashify. If you provide a friend's email address to us for this reason, we will use that email address only for the purpose of sending a onetime invitation to your friend. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:info@Cashify.in">info@Cashify.in</a> to remove their information from our database.</p>
                        <div class="tncHead mar-btm-10 mar-tp-10">Use of personal information</div>
                        <p>We will treat your personal information as confidential, and we will not share your personal information with third parties without your permission, except in the limited circumstances described below. If you accept a referral from Cashify to one of our partner sites, we may provide PII to the partner site to save you having to re-enter that information. When you select a partner site to sell your phone to, you must opt in to allow your PII to be submitted to that partner site, and you agree to be bound by their privacy policy as regards use of your PII.</p>
                        <p>We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as fulfilling your request for a free shipping kit, purchasing your phone, or sending confirmation or other emails. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>
                        <p>We may provide your personal information to our third party marketing partners so they may offer you goods and services which you may find of interest. If you do not wish to receive offers from these third parties, you may unsubscribe from their mailing lists by following the instructions in the offer. If you respond to any such offer, your information will be subject to that third party's privacy policy. We may disclose your personal information when we reasonably believe that it is required by a law or legal process and to protect and defend the rights and interests of Cashify, its affiliates, suppliers, or users. In the event Cashify goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.</p>
                        <p>We may use and disclose your aggregated usage information with others, in a form that does not identify any individual, to allow Cashify and our advertisers to present targeted advertising to you. We may disclose to third parties, including advertisers and potential business partners, aggregated statistics that we develop from your usage habits, preferences, and history. For example, we may disclose generalized information about usage habits based on aggregated statistics developed from your site usage behavior and search history. This statistical information will not identify any individual.</p>
                        <div class="tncHead mar-btm-10 mar-tp-10">Control of personal information</div>
                        <p>You can confirm, change, delete or update personal information you have provided to us by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@Cashify.in">info@Cashify.in</a>.</p>
                        <p>When you opt-out of promotional communications from us, you may still receive service messages (such as an order confirmation) and legally mandated notices and third party marketing messages Please note that, even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

                        <div class="tncHead mar-btm-10 mar-tp-10">Security of personal information</div>
                        <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is one hundred percent secure and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Please contact us, if you have any questions about security on our site.</p>

                        <div class="tncHead mar-btm-10 mar-tp-10">Protection of children's privacy</div>
                        <p>We do not knowingly collect any PII from people under the age of 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 is attempting to submit this information, we will inform the minor that he or she is ineligible to do so. We will then remove this information from our records.</p>

                        <div class="tncHead mar-btm-10 mar-tp-10">Use of cookies and tracking technology</div>
                        <p>When you visit our site we may store information about your web session and assign you one or more cookies. Your browser will store these cookies on your computer in a small text file, and if you return to the site the cookie may be read.

Cookies are not linked to your personal information.</p>
                        <p>We may also use web beacons, clear gif technology, or action tags as mechanisms to collect aggregate site visitation data by tracking how users navigate to and through our website.

                        <p>Cashify works with advertising partners to place advertising on our site. Our third party advertising partners often use a cookie or third party web beacon to track when a click becomes a sale. No PII is ever sent to these advertising partners.</p>

You may opt- out of these emails by following the unsubscribe link in an email.</p>
