We aim for the Website to be a safe and enjoyable environment for you.

**This privacy policy (hereafter the "Policy") primarily describes:**

The information that CAL collects through the Website (www.casioindiashop.com), which is hosted and operated from India; the use and role of cookies and similar technologies on the Website (www.casioindiashop.com); and the security measures CAL has in place to protect the information that CAL gathers through the Website (www.casioindiashop.com).

This Policy does not govern CAL's collection of information through any website, or by any other means, other than through this Website, or the collection of information by any parent, or subsidiaries of CAL ("Other Entities").

Visitors are encouraged to read this Policy before using the Website. By using the Website, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy and the Terms and Conditions, available at www.casioindiashop.com.

#### 1\. Information Gathered by CAL through the Website (www.casioindiashop.com)

CAL gathers two basic types of information through the Website: (i) "Personal Information," information from which an individual can be identified, and (ii) "Aggregate Information," from which an individual cannot be identified.

**a.** Personal Information. You are not ordinarily required to register or provide Personal Information in order to access the Website, though certain functionalities such as a membership program, through which purchasers of products may receive discounts on online purchases, participating in any contests, etc., may require registration. CAL collects Personal Information from you only when you voluntarily provide it to CAL - for example, in contacting CAL through the Website, filling in the form for applying for a vacancy or while requesting for a visit to the warehouse of CAL, or exploring business opportunities with CAL, answering surveys and polls, entering contests, sweepstakes, raffles and similar promotions, signing up for email/SMS updates and announcements concerning the CAL's products and special promotions, and purchasing the CAL’s merchandise. Personal Information may include your contact information (such as your name, postal address, telephone numbers and/or email address), as well as your payment information, such as credit card number and expiration date ("Payment Information"), which will be collected if you wish to purchase any product or merchandise made available through the Website ("Transaction").

**b.** Aggregate Information. When you visit the Website, the CAL and the third parties with whom the CAL has contracted to provide services, may collect anonymous information from three sources: server log files, cookies, and pixel tags.

**1.** Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in the CAL’s server log files whenever you visit the Website, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. IP addresses of all Visitors are used by the CAL to calculate the Website usage levels, to help diagnose problems with the Website's servers, and to administer the Website. CAL may also use IP addresses to communicate or to block access by Visitors who fail to comply with the Policy and/or the Terms and Conditions of Use of the Website. Collecting IP addresses is a standard practice followed on the Internet and is carried out automatically by many websites.

**2.** This website uses cookies. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual's computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by most websites, and help facilitate users' on-going access to and use of a particular website. Cookies do not cause damage to the computer system or files, and only the website that transfers a particular cookie to the computer system can read, modify or delete such cookie. If you do not want your information to be collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure to be followed, in most of the browsers, by the user that allows the user to delete existing cookies, automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of particular cookies to the user's computer system. You should note, however, that declining cookies may make it difficult or impossible for you to access certain portions of the Website.

**3.** This website uses "Pixel Tags". The Website may use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") to compile aggregate statistics about Website usage and response rates. Pixel Tags enables CAL to maintain a count of the users who have visited certain pages of the Website.
