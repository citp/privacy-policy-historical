We will only contact you for marketing purposes where you have given your consent to be contacted for those purposes.

 **Credit checks**

If you apply for a loan from us, in order to process your application, we will need to perform something called a "credit search". This helps us to decide whether or not you are eligible to receive a loan from us. To help us to make this decision, we may need to obtain information from Credit Reference Agencies ("CRAs") and/or Fraud Prevention Agencies ("FPAs"). We may also have to pass on some of your information to the CRAs and/or FPAs that we use. This section of the Privacy Policy sets out in detail what we, CRAs and FPAs do with your information for credit check purposes and why. 

By signing and submitting a loan application form, you will be agreeing to us, CRAs and FPAs sharing your information as described in this Privacy Policy. It is therefore important that you read this document carefully and make sure that you understand it. 

**1** **FAQs**

1.1What is a credit reference agency? 

Credit reference agencies collect and maintain information on consumers’ and businesses’ credit behaviour, on behalf of organisations in the UK.

1.2What is a fraud prevention agency? 

Fraud Prevention Agencies collect, maintain and share information on known and suspected fraudulent activity. Some CRAs also act as FPAs. 

1.3Why do we use CRAs and FPAs? 

Although you have applied to us and we will check our own records, we will also contact CRAs to get information on your credit behaviour with other organisations. This will help us make the best possible assessment of your overall situation before we make a decision. 

1.4Where do CRAs and FPAs get the information? 

1.4.1Some of the information CRAs and FPAs obtain is publicly available, such as information from:

(a)the Electoral Register (obtained from Local Authorities)

(b)County Court Judgments (obtained from Registry Trust)

(c)Bankruptcy and similar Orders (obtained from the Insolvency Service)

1.4.2Fraud information may also come from fraud prevention agencies. 

1.4.3Credit information comes from information on applications to banks, building societies, credit card companies etc and also from the conduct of those accounts. 

1.5How will you know if your information is to be sent to a CRA or FPA? 

You will be told when you apply for a loan if your application data is to be supplied to a CRA or FPA. The next section of this Privacy Policy explains how, when and why we will search at CRAs and FPAs and what we will do with the information we obtain from them. The next section of this Privacy Policy also explains that we send payment history information, information on you or your business, if you have one, to CRAs. You can ask us at any time for the name of CRAs and FPAs that we use. 

1.6Why is your information used in this way? 

We and other organisations want to make the best possible decisions we can, in order to make sure that your loan amount is affordable for you. Some organisations may also use the information to check your identity. In this way we can ensure that we all make responsible decisions. At the same time we also want to make decisions quickly and easily and, by using up to date information, provided electronically, we are able to make the most reliable and fair decisions possible. 

1.7Who controls what we, CRAs and FPAs are allowed to do with your data? 

All organisations that collect and process personal data are regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998, overseen by the Information Commissioner’s Office. All CRAs are in regular dialogue with the Commissioner. Use of the Electoral Register is controlled under the Representation of the People Act 2000. 

1.8Can just anyone look at your information held at CRAs? 

No, access to your information is very strictly controlled and only those that are entitled to do so may see it. Usually that will only be with your agreement or (very occasionally) if there is a legal requirement.
