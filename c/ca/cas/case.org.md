# CASE Privacy Statement & Policy | CASE

## Last updated January 4, 2019

The Council for Advancement and Support of Education is a nonprofit membership association serving educational institutions and the advancement professionals who work on their behalf in alumni relations, communications, development, marketing and allied areas. CASE helps its members build stronger relationships with their alumni and donors, raise funds for campus projects, produce recruitment materials, market their institutions to prospective students, diversify the profession, and foster public support of education.

CASE helps its members build stronger relationships with all of their constituencies by providing relevant research, supporting growth in the profession and fostering support of education.

CASE also offers a variety of advancement products and services, provides standards and an ethical framework for the profession, and works with other organizations to respond to public issues of concern while promoting the importance of education worldwide.

This Privacy Statement (the 'Statement') explains the personal information we collect from you, either directly or indirectly, and how we use it. Personal information is any information that can be used to identify you or that can be linked to you. The Statement also covers the choices you can make about the data we collect, and how you can control these decisions. It applies to all products and services offered by CASE. It also applies to any CASE-controlled websites (including [www.case.org](https://www.case.org/)) or mobile apps that link to this Statement, as well as other interactions with CASE, such as attending a CASE event. Please read this Statement carefully to understand how CASE may collect, use, and share your personal information. The terms 'we', 'us', or 'CASE' are each intended as reference to the Council for Advancement and Support of Education.

**Information you provide to us**  
In order to use certain features of the CASE website, a user must first complete a registration form. During registration, users will be asked to provide contact information, such as name and email address, phone number, institutional affiliation, and job title. This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they may have expressed interest. It will be optional for the user to provide additional information, such as demographic information or other personal information so that we can provide a more personalized experience.

Whenever you place an order via the site, on the phone or by mail, or register for a conference, information will be requested on an order form. The information requested includes name and shipping address as well as financial information such as a payment card number and expiration date. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill orders. (Please note that CASE does not store payment card information in its databases except for the expiration date and the last four digits of the card).

We collect information you voluntarily provide to us, such as your name, phone number and email address; for instance, when you want to learn more about CASE membership, products or educational opportunities, or when you contact our membership support center for assistance. We may collect this information through surveys and benchmarking studies.

**Information we collect automatically**  
We automatically collect information about you through the use of cookies and similar technologies when you use, access or interact with us via our websites or apps. We use this information to automate certain aspects of our website, to "remember" you when you enter our site, to track your preferences, geographic location and to retain any personalization you've done to enhance your experience with CASE.

**Information obtained from other sources**  
We may, on occasion, receive information about you from other sources, including third parties, such as partners with whom we offer co-branded conferences or engage in joint marketing activities. We may also receive information about you from social media platforms, for instance, when you interact with us on those platforms. We protect data obtained from third parties according to the practices described in this Statement and we also apply any additional restrictions imposed by the source of data.

We may also engage third parties to serve the advertisements that appear on our Web site and within other parts of the CASE interface. These companies may use cookies to ensure you do not see the same advertisements too often, and these cookies also may collect information about you when you view or click on an advertisement. Such ad-serving companies are responsible for placing and reading these cookies; we do not have access to these cookies or control how they are used.

**Supplemental Information**  
CASE supplements the information you provide with information that is received from third parties. For example, we may include in your profile data supplied by the institution at which you are employed.

In addition to the use of cookies as described above, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your preferences and to gather broad demographic information.

We use the information you provide about yourself when ordering a product or service, registering for a conference, or becoming a CASE member in order to complete the transaction. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete the transaction.

We use the information we collect based on usage by those who register with the CASE website to customize the information on the site to the user's interests.

We use the information you provide about yourself for the online membership directory for a variety of organizational purposes, including sharing with you information about CASE products and services we think might be of interest to you. CASE also uses personal information for advertising and marketing purposes, such as by sending offers for products and services that we think will be of interest to you.

Finally, we do not intend to use or share the personal information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

**Public Forums**  
The website makes interest or group-based communities available to its users. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes available to other members of the group and you should therefore exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

We offer postal mailing lists for rent to third parties. On occasion we may send an email communication to our members on behalf of a third party, but we do not share email addresses with external organizations or individuals without consent.

CASE uses a variety of third-party vendors to carry out services like website and database management and hosting, online product shipping, credit card processing and email communications. We only share your personal information as needed, such as to complete a transaction or to provide a product or service you have requested. In this case, your personal information will be shared with these agents or contractors but only for the purpose of performing services on behalf of CASE and in accordance with this Statement. It is our legitimate interest to share information with these parties for these purposes.

We use data gathered through surveys and benchmarking studies solely for the purposes described therein. Unless specifically noted otherwise, no personal information is disclosed in reporting on these surveys and studies. We may also share your personal information as part of a corporate sale, merger, or acquisition, or other transfer of all or part of our assets including as part of a bankruptcy proceeding; pursuant to a subpoena, court order, governmental inquiry, or other legal process or as otherwise required by law, or to protect our rights or the rights of third parties; or with your consent or as otherwise disclosed at the time of data collection or sharing.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and other CASE services. We also may share such information with associations, organizations and commercial enterprises to help them understand the makeup of the CASE membership.

**Performance of a contract**  
The relationship between CASE and its member institutions is such that in order to fulfill the obligations related to membership, it is necessary for us to process personal information related to the employees of our member institutions who participate in our programs. This relationship also extends to individuals who are not employed by member institutions but who have willingly entered into a relationship with us, for example, by registering for a conference or purchasing a product.

**Security**  
CASE takes reasonable precautions to guard the personal information we collect, but please be advised that no system is impenetrable.

We use a variety of appropriate technical and organizational measures and industry standards to protect your personal information and help prevent information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities. In addition, we ensure that our third-party data center vendors provide adequate security measures. Moreover, your password is stored using one-way hash, which means that it cannot be recovered (or disclosed) by anyone, including CASE.

You can only access your CASE account information through the use of an individual user login and password. To protect the confidentiality of your personal information, keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. Please alert us immediately if you believe your password has been misused. Additionally, always log out and close your browser when you finish your session. Please note, we will never ask you to disclose your password.

**Storage**  
Personal information collected by CASE may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our data center), or in any other country where CASE or its service providers are located or maintain facilities. CASE has put in place adequate mechanisms to protect personal information when it is transferred internationally, for example by using the Standard Contractual Clauses as approved by the European Commission.

**Retention**  
CASE will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to enable you to engage with CASE relative to your organization's membership or your participation in CASE activities, to provide services to you, to comply with audit requirements (including those regarding document retention), resolve disputes with any parties and otherwise as necessary to allow us to conduct our business. All personal information we retain will be subject to this Privacy Statement and our internal retention guidelines.
