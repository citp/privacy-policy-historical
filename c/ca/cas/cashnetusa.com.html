<p>***Some customers applying for payday loans or installment loans may be required to submit additional documentation due to state law and qualification criteria.</p>
<p>†CashNetUSA or third-party lender does not perform traditional credit checks as part of its credit transaction approval process, but does verify applicant information via national databases including, but not limited to, Clarity. If you have defaulted on past transactions, you may be declined for a cash advance from CashNetUSA.</p>
