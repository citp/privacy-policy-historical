		We are committed to protecting your personal information. We have created this Privacy Policy to let you know what information We collect when you use Our services at Our online sites (collectively, the '<strong>Service</strong>'), why We collect this information and how We use the collected information.<br>
		<br>
		Please note that this Privacy Policy will be agreed between you and the PartyGaming group being PartyGaming PLC together with its subsidiaries from time to time including but not limited to iGlobalMedia Entertainment Limited ('<strong>PartyGaming</strong>','<strong>We</strong>', '<strong>Us</strong>' or '<strong>Our</strong>', as appropriate).<br>
		<br>
		We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy and will notify you of these changes by posting the modified terms on Our online site. We recommend that you revisit this Privacy Policy regularly.<br>
		<br>

		<span class="mainTextSubHeader">2. INFORMATION COLLECTED</span><br>
		We consider information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, first and last name, date of birth, credit card information, home or other physical address, email address, phone number or other contact information to be Personal Information ('<strong>Personal Information</strong>'). You may be asked to provide Personal Information when you use Our website, register for an account or to use the Service. The Personal Information that We collect may include information such as: contact information (including telephone number), shipping information, billing information, transaction history, website usage preferences, and feedback regarding the Service. This information is held by Us on servers based in Gibraltar and/or Alderney and elsewhere from time to time. In addition, when you interact with the Service, Our servers keep an activity log unique to you that collects certain administrative and traffic information including: source IP address, time of access, date of access, web page(s) visited, language use, software crash reports and type of browser used. This information is essential for the provision and quality of the Service. We do not collect Personal Information about you on the Service without your knowledge.<br>
		<br>

		<span class="mainTextSubHeader">3. MEANS OF COLLECTING AND PROCESSING DATA</span><br>
		We may automatically collect certain data as discussed above and receive Personal Information about you where you provide such information through the Service or other communications and interactions with Us. We may also receive Personal Information from online vendors and service providers that refer you to Our sites, and from customer lists lawfully acquired from third-party vendors. In addition, We may engage the services of third-party service providers to provide technical support, process your online transactions and maintain your online account. We will have access to any information you provide to such vendors, service providers and third-party e-commerce services, and We will use the Personal Information as set out in this Privacy Policy below. This information will only be disclosed to third parties outside the PartyGaming group in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We take steps to ensure that Our arrangements with third-party service providers and online vendors protect your privacy.<br>
		<br>
		
		<span class="mainTextSubHeader">4. INFORMATION USE</span><br>
		We use the Personal Information We collect from you to deliver Our Service, to provide customer support, to undertake necessary security and identify verification checks, to process any of your online transactions, meet certain business requirements and for any other purpose related to the operation of the Service. Your Personal Information may also be used by Us to provide you with promotional offers and information regarding Our products and services and in order for Us to better provide a range of products and services and improved customer service. From time-to-time, We may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and, therefore, you have the choice of whether or not to disclose such information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name, correspondence address and telephone number), and demographic information (such as zip or postal code or age). If you choose to participate in a survey or contest and win, by accepting any contest prize or winnings from Us, you consent to use of your name and likeness for advertising and promotional purposes without additional compensation, except where prohibited by law. Unless you have elected not to receive promotional information, We may also use your Personal Information (including your email address and phone number) to provide you with information regarding our products, services and promotions, including other gaming products (including online poker, casino and bingo services) and products and services from third parties carefully selected by Us.<br>
		<br>
		
		<span class="mainTextSubHeader">5. CERTAIN EXCLUDED DISCLOSURES</span><br>
		We may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law, or if We believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with any legal process served on Us, any of Our sites or the Service or in circumstances where We are under a substantially similar legal obligation; (2) protect and defend Our rights or property; or (3) act to protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public. If, in Our sole determination, you are found to have cheated or attempted to defraud Us, or any other user of the Service in any way including but not limited to game manipulation or payment fraud, or if We suspect you of fraudulent payment, including use of stolen credit cards, or any other fraudulent activity (including any chargeback or other reversal of a payment) or prohibited transaction (including money laundering), We reserve the right to share this information (together with your identity) with other online gaming sites, banks, credit card companies, and appropriate agencies.<br>

		<span class="mainTextSubHeader">8. CONSENT TO USE OF ELECTRONIC SERVICE PROVIDERS</span><br>
		In order to play real money games on the Service, you will be required to send money to and receive money from Us. We may use third-party electronic payment processors and/or financial institutions ('ESPs') to process such financial transactions. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly consent to Personal Information necessary for the processing of transactions being shared with ESPs, including, where necessary, the transfer of information outside of your country. We take steps to ensure that Our arrangements with ESPs protect your privacy.<br>
		<br>
		
		<span class="mainTextSubHeader">9. CONSENT TO SECURITY REVIEW</span><br>
		We reserve the right to conduct a security review at any time to validate your identity, age, the registration data provided by you and to verify your use of the Service and your financial transactions for potential breach of Our <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a> and of applicable law. By accepting Our <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a> you authorise Us, Our staff, agents and suppliers to use your Personal Information and to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purposes of validating the information you provide to Us in the course of using the Services, including, where necessary, the transfer of information outside of your country. Security reviews may include but are not limited to ordering a credit report and/or otherwise verifying the information you provide against third-party databases. In addition, to facilitate these security reviews, you agree to provide such information or documentation as We may request.<br>
		<br>

		<span class="mainTextSubHeader">10. SECURITY</span><br>
		We understand the importance of information security and the techniques needed to secure information. We store all of the Personal Information We receive directly from you in a password-protected database residing within Our secure network behind active state-of-the-art firewall software. Our online sites and the Service support SSL Version 3 with 128-bit encryption. We take steps to ensure Our subsidiaries, agents, affiliates and suppliers also employ adequate levels of security.<br>
		<br>
		
		<span class="mainTextSubHeader">11. PROTECTION OF CHILDREN</span><br>
		The Service is not intended for or directed at persons under the age of eighteen (18) (or the lawful age in their respective jurisdiction). Any person who provides their information to Us through any part of the Service represents to Us that they are eighteen (18) years of age (or the lawful age in their respective jurisdiction) or older. It is Our policy to uncover attempts by minors to access Our Services which may involve Us having to access and verify your Personal Information. This may involve Us having to access and verify your Personal Information. If We become aware that a minor has attempted to or has submitted personal information via the online site, We will not accept this information and will take steps to remove such information from Our records.<br>
		<br>

		Personal Information collected on the Service may be stored and processed in any country in which We or Our affiliates, suppliers, ESPs or agents maintain facilities.

Nevertheless, We take steps to ensure that Our agents, affiliates and suppliers comply with Our standards of privacy regardless of their location.<br>
		<br>
		
		<span class="mainTextSubHeader">13. THIRD-PARTY PRACTICES</span><br>
		We cannot ensure the protection of any information or images that you provide to a third-party online site that links to or from Our sites or any information collected by any third party administering Our affiliate program (if applicable) or any other program, since these third-party online sites are owned and operated independently of Us. Any information collected by these third parties is not governed by this Privacy Policy but by the privacy policy, if any, of such third party. If you have questions about a third party's information practices, please read its privacy policy. We assume no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the practices, actions or policies of such third parties, and We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such online sites.<br>
		<br>

		<br>
		
		<span class="mainTextSubHeader">15. MERGERS AND OTHER EVENTS REQUIRING TRANSFER</span><br>
