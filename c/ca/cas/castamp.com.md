**Your Choices**

You may update, correct, or delete your user information and preferences by clicking on the "Edit Settings" link on the top left of the page once you have logged in to the CastAMP.com Platform.

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

**Advertisers**

CastAMP.com may allow advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within the CastAMP.com site, services and software. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. CastAMP.com does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks CastAMP.com to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, males age 15 to 18) or audience segment (for example, males age 15 to 18 who have participated in certain promotions) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks.

Some of these companies are participants in the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing and analytic companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. You can learn more about NAI and how you may "opt out" of targeted advertising delivered by NAI member ad networks here:

This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. CastAMP.com reserves the right the add or remove third-party ad networks or ad servers in its discretion and CastAMP.com may not at all times list such updated ad network or ad server partners in this Privacy Policy.

**Our Commitment to Data Security**

CastAMP.com uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to CastAMP.com, and you do so at your own risk.

However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. 

If CastAMP.com learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. CastAMP.com may post a notice on the CastAMP.com Platform if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
