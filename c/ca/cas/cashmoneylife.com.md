### **About Cash Money Life**

Cash Money Life is designed to share tips and information about personal finance, career, self improvement, and more . I am not a professional financial planner, but I am positive you will find a lot of useful information in these pages.

While I am open about many aspects of my financial life, I would like to stress something that I feel is very important: _this is not a competition between me and anyone else_. We are all in different financial positions, geographical areas, age groups, etc. This blog keeps me honest about my situation and goals and hopefully will do the same for others.

### **About Me**

My name is Patrick. I am married with no children, though children may be in our future. I served one tour in the US military, and I also run a military money website - [**Military Finance Network**](http://militaryfinancenetwork.com/). My wife and I live in the Mid-West and plan on being here for a few more years. In the meantime, we continue to enjoy our current life while planning our future.

I wish you all well on your personal journey to financial freedom and happiness!

~ Patrick
