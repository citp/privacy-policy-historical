Please read on to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting castle.com’s website at castle.com.com or any of our other websites, applications, domain names or other linked pages, or using any of our services (collectively, the “Services”), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. By using the Services, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.

#### **WHAT THIS IS SAYING**

Your privacy is very important to us. This policy tells you how your personal information is used after you create a castle.com account. By using castle.com, you acknowledge that you’ve read and accepted these policies.

You are responsible for any Content (as that term is defined in our [Terms of Service](http://castle.com/terms-of-service/)) you provide in connection with the Services. We cannot control the actions of users with whom you or any Services subscribers may choose to share information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that Content you or any user posts on the Services will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.

## **WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?**

This Privacy Policy explains how castle.com collects and uses information from you and other users who access or use the Services, including our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”). References to “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy shall apply to personal information of individual users of the Services. Also, this Privacy Policy covers castle.com’s treatment of any Personal Information that our partners share with us, or that you provide to castle.com through a third party website or service using a castle.com application. This policy does not apply to websites or services or practices of companies that we do not own or control.

#### **WHAT THIS IS SAYING**

Here’s what this policy covers: all information that you provide to us and that we collect while you’re using castle.com. This policy doesn’t cover 3rd party companies that we don’t control but who help us operate our service. Keep reading, there’s more about this later!

## **HOW IS CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION TREATED?**

We have included some information below related to the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”). COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent or provide notice before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 (“under age users”). Pursuant to COPPA, we may collect an underage user’s name (first name and last initial), date of birth, email address and/or telephone number in order to operate and provide the castle.com Services, and we may collect the underage user’s parent’s (or legal guardian’s) email address in order to provide notice to parents that we may contact their underage user for the purpose of providing the Services. If castle.com does not receive the parent’s email address within a reasonable time period, the underage user will not be able to receive any messages and **his/her personally identifiable information will be deleted.** If an underage user’s castle.com account is inactive for at least twelve months (meaning, the account has not received a message through the Services in that period of time), castle.com’s policy is to delete the personally-identifiable information. If we learn we have collected Personal Information from an underage user other than pursuant to the above, or if we learn that an underage user has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that an underage user may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at [report@castle.com](mailto:report@castle.com). ****

#### **WHAT THIS IS SAYING**

castle.com collects limited personal information from users under 13, and notifies a parent or guardian when collecting personal information from users under 13 years old. We will delete their personal information if the child’s account does not have an associated email address from a parent or guardian, or if the account has been inactive for at least 12 months. Any questions or concerns? Just email us! [contact@castle.com](mailto:contact@castle.com)

## **WHAT INFORMATION DOES castle.COM DISPLAY OR COLLECT?**

When you use the Services, you may set up your personal profile, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels as permitted by the functionality of the Services. castle.com will not share personal contact information between Organizers and Subscribers (as those terms are defined in [castle.com’s Terms of Service](http://castle.com/terms-of-service/)) without user permission. The information we gather from users enables us to verify user identity and allows our users to set up a user account and profile through the Services, and helps us personalize and improve our services. We retain such information to provide the Services to you and our other users and to provide a useful user experience. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.

For underage users, we collect a name (first name and last initial), date of birth, email address and/or telephone number, and that underage user’s parent’s email address, to provide notice to parents regarding the service. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the Personal Information we receive about you to enable us to provide you with the Services and also for purposes such as:

  * authenticating your identity,

None of this information constitutes Personal Information. Certain information that is collected automatically, such as device ID and phone number, will be treated as Personal Information.

We also may provide to our partners aggregate information derived from such automatically collected information about how our users, collectively, use our site. We may share this type of non-personally identifiable, aggregated statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our partners’ services as well as the Services.

#### **WHAT THIS IS SAYING**

There is certain information that we gather automatically when you use castle.com, such as your IP address and cookie information. We still treat this as personal information and are very careful with it.

## **WHAT ABOUT COOKIES, PIXELS AND LOCAL STORAGE?**

Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you browse the web. Like many websites, castle.com uses cookies to discover how people are using our Services and to make them work better.

A pixel is a small amount of code on a web page or in an email notification. As many services do, we (or our Agents) may use pixels to learn whether you’ve interacted with certain of web or email content on our Services. This helps us measure and improve our Services and personalize your experience on castle.com.

Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on your computer or mobile device. We use local storage to customize what we show you based on your past interactions with castle.com.

castle.com uses these technologies to deliver, measure, and improve our Services in various ways. These uses generally fall into one of the following categories:

  * **Authentication and security:**
    * To log you into castle.com.
    * To protect your security.
    * To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate the castle.com Rules.
  * **Preferences:**
    * For example, these technologies help authenticate your access to castle.com and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your account. They also let us show you appropriate content through our Services.
    * To remember information about your browser and your preferences.
  * **Analytics and research:**
    * For example, cookies may help us remember your preferred language or country that you are in. We can then provide you with castle.com content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit castle.com. We can also customize content based on your country, such as disabling SMS, or to withhold certain content based on applicable local laws.
    * To help us improve and understand how people use our Services.Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you will not be able to log in or use many of the Services’ features without cookies enabled. Note that the use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.



#### **WHAT THIS IS SAYING**

For example, cookies help us test different versions of our services to see which particular features or content users prefer. We might also optimize and improve your experience on castle.com by using cookies to see how you interact with our services, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on. We may use Google Analytics to assist us with this.
