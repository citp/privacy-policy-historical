We created this Privacy Policy in order to inform you about the information we collect on the Cashfiesta.com web site, how we use this information, how we protect it, and what choices you have regarding the collection and use of your personal information. 

Please read the Privacy Policy carefully as by visiting and sharing information on the Cashfiesta.com site you agree to be bound by the Policy. 

Information We Collect

In addition to the information you explicitly share with us when you fill out our join form to become a Cashfiesta.com member, or when you contact us by email or another means, we collect the following information: 

  * Information about your device such as user agent of your browser, the URL that you came to our site from, the IP address you joined or logged in from, join and login timestamps. 
  * If you are logged in, we also collect information about your use of the services we offer, such as offers you respond to. 

We collect this information using log files, cookies, and similar tracking technologies. 

Cookies

Cookies are small data files that a web site server stores on a computer. They contain information about activities performed by a user of the computer on the specific web site and characteristics of the computer at the time the user navigates the site. Examples: the IP address of the computer at the time the user navigates the site; the password the user has set for the site, so that the user doesn't have to type it each time he/she tries to log in at the site, etc. As cookies are data files, not code, they cannot erase or read information from a computer's hard drive or from other sites the computer user visits. Cookies can only be read by the server of the site, which has set them, so that information about activities on one site can't be transferred through a cookie to another site. 

We may store two types of cookies on your computer: 

  * Session Cookies: These cookies are stored in the Internet browser and are deleted each time the browser is closed. We use session cookies mainly to facilitate site navigation: for example, once you log in to the site, you don't have to log in again during the same session; and to personalize site experience.
  * Permanent Cookies: These cookies are stored on the hard drive of your computer. They are not exactly "permanent". Each cookie has different "life span" determined by the web site that sets the cookie. We may use permanent cookies to store your username and password (encrypted) on your computer if you opt to have it saved.

We may use both types of cookies for aggregate audience analysis: where our visitors and members come from, which pages they visit, how much time they spend on the site, which offers are most popular among members, etc. No personal information is stored in the cookies. 

Use of Your information

We use your mailing address and payment info in order to send your payments. We use your e-mail address to send you our monthly newsletter and other transactional messages related to your Cashfiesta.com membership and, in case you opt to receive such, special offers and promotions from Cashfiesta.com and on behalf of our affiliated and non-affiliated partners. We use the tax forms to comply with tax authority requirements. 

If you provide us with demographic and interest info, we use it to improve the relevance of the offers we show you.   
The information about your activity on the Cashfiesta.com is used to personalize and facilitate your experience, and to prevent abuse. We also use aggregated, anonymized data to analyze site performance, prevent technical problems, improve existing website services and develop new ones.   
We use information about the offers you responded to in order to give you credit for Special Offers you have completed.   
We don't create user profiles and don't engage in IBA (interest based advertising) as defined by [NAI](http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising)

Security of Your Personal Information

Your data may be stored and processed in the United States or the European Union and the European Economic Area in compliance with applicable data privacy and security legislation. We secure your personal information by using reasonable technical efforts to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, or accidental loss or destruction of the information that we collect. We have taken steps to ensure the ongoing integrity, availability, confidentiality and resilience of systems that process personal information, and will restore information in a timely manner in the event of a technical or physical incident. Sensitive data exchange between our website and your browser happens over a SSL secured channel and is protected with digital signatures.   
Unfortunately, no transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your data, it may be possible for third parties to unlawfully intercept or access transmitted data. Unauthorized entry, hardware or software failure, as well as other factors may compromise data security. We can't guarantee the security of information you transmit to us.

These companies can only use the information for the purpose of providing you with the services requested and provided they comply with all relevant privacy and data security requirements. 

Other circumstances under which we may disclose your personal information: 

  1. in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; 
  2. if disclosure is necessary to protect the rights or safety of Cashfiesta.com employees, affiliates, or any third parties 
  3. in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or as otherwise required by law;
