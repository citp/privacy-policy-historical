  2. **Information Collection, Use and Disclosure**


  * Information Requests. If you wish to request more information about Castlight, you are required to provide contact information such as your name and email address. This information will be used by Castlight to contact you about our services.
  * Log Files. As with of most websites, Castlight automatically collects and stores in log files the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access the service; and the Internet address of the website from which you directly linked to Castlight. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. Castlight uses this log file information to analyze trends, monitor service traffic and usage patterns for internal marketing and security purposes, and to help make the Castlight Health Corporate Websites more useful.
  * Information from Third Parties. We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records or third parties may provide information in connection with a business relationship. If others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason, if any, for which it was provided to us.
  * Information about Third Parties. We may also collect from you information about your contacts. Your disclosure of such information is completely voluntary.   For example, we may collect names and email addresses in order to forward job postings.

  * Survey you to evaluate and improve the Castlight service. If you choose to participate, we will request certain personal information from you. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and business address).  We use this information to improve the service accuracy and develop new products. We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or fulfill any prizes associated with campaigns. We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties for a reason unrelated to the contest or survery unless we give you prior notice and choice.
  * Locator information, which may include your name, email address, physical address, and/or other data that enables someone to personally identify you.
