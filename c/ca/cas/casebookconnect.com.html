These technical methods may enable us or our vendors to collect and use information in a form that is personally identifiable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our vendors may also transfer this information to other third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on our behalf.

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use of Personal Data Collected</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Personal data collected by Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business may be used for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users' behavior, for product development, for content improvement, to inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on their advertisements, or to customize the content and layout of the applicable site or mobile application. The information collected by our Web Services also may be used for responding to your inquiries and otherwise corresponding with you, for processing transactions you request, maintaining your account (if you have one), for other purposes permitted by your organization's customer agreement(s) (if any) for products and services (including disclosure of personal information to the subscribing organization by agreement), to maintain the security and integrity of our Web Services for the purpose of conducting market research or surveys on our behalf, and for the administration, review and/or the improvement of the content of our Web Services.&nbsp; Aggregate data on visitors' home servers may be used for internal purposes or provided to third parties, such as advertisers. Individually identifying information, such as names, postal and email addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to us may be added to our contact databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding site or application updates, new products and services, upcoming events, and status of orders placed online.&nbsp; We also may enhance or merge your information collected with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wolters Kluwer sometimes collects non-identifiable information through our Web Services to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on our Web Services, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." We or others on our behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics in order to help us provide better customer service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may use demographic and preference information to allow advertising on one or more of our Web Services that can be targeted to the users for whom they are most pertinent. This means users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business does not sell, rent, or intentionally make publicly available any individually identifying information.&nbsp; We reserve the right to transfer personal information to a purchaser or successor entity in the event of a sale or other corporate transaction involving some or all of our business.&nbsp; We may disclose to third parties information in aggregate form, that is publicly available, and/or that is knowingly and voluntarily disclosed by visitors. If there are advertisements on our Web Services, the advertiser(s) may be electronically notified when visitors view or click on its advertisements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may disclose information you provide to us to third parties in order to complete a transaction that you requested or as otherwise permitted by your organization's customer agreement(s) (if any).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may also outsource some tasks, including the operation of certain Web Service functions that require access to information you supply online and information about your visits to our Web Services.&nbsp; &nbsp;In such cases, however, we require that the companies acting on our behalf institute safeguards to protect the confidentiality of your information. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We contract with other companies to provide certain services on our behalf, including credit-card and billing processing, shipping, e-mail distribution, list processing and analytics or promotions management. These service providers are restricted from using this data in any way other than to provide services to us, and they may not share, resell or use the data for their own direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We rely on some of our affiliates for support of the products and services we offer, and we share some of our back-office functions with other Wolters Kluwer companies.&nbsp; Our affiliates all follow applicable law and privacy policies in connection with preserving the confidentiality of any personal information they may access or receive. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Where your use of our Web Services is through a subscription obtained by your employer or other organization, that subscribing organization may be provided access to certain utilization data about the Web Service consistent with the terms of the customer subscription agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other than as described in this Privacy Statement, we will not disclose any identifiable personal information about your usage of our Web Services to unaffiliated third parties, except as necessary to service the account, to enforce the terms of use, to meet our obligations to content and technology providers, or as required by law. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Measures</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business has implemented numerous security features to help protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For instance, when a visitor places an order on this site or application (if any) or accesses his or her account information (if any), we may offer the visitor the ability to use a secure server. A secure server encrypts information a visitor inputs before it is sent to us, and is also used to securely store personal information. Please be advised, however, that while Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business has endeavored to create secure and reliable Web Services for visitors and users, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to/from us via our Web Services &nbsp;or via e-mail cannot be guaranteed. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will always be unable to defeat our security measures. Accordingly, Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business and our affiliates are not responsible for the security or confidentiality of information transmitted or accessible via the Internet.</p>
<p> </p>
