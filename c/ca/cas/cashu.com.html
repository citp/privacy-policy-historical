		<b>Collection of Personal Information</b><br>
		To open your cashU account, we must obtain certain personal information,
		such as name, address, email or phone number as well as demographic information.
		 You should ensure the email address you have registered with us is always correct,
		  so that we can always contact you with important information regarding your account.
		   For certain optional transactions, we also collect selected financial information
		    such as credit card details. For transaction volumes over a certain limit, we are
		    legally required to report some personally identifiable information to the authorities.
		     For verification purposes we reserve the right to request proof of identification in
		      an offline format. Your IP address and access times may be tracked against your user
		       id for the dual purposes of preventing fraud and creating an audit trail when
		        using the cashU service.
		<br><br>
		<b>Use of Personal Information</b>
		<br>
		We only use your personal information to service your account
		and to improve our services to you. However, we do share some financial
		 information as part of normal business operations with banks or credit
		  card processing and verification services. These entities may not use
		   your information for secondary purposes, unless required by law.
		   Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy we may need
		   to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have
		    a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a
		    current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served
		    on our web site. In the event of a sale of the Company or its assets,
		     your Personal Information may be disclosed to the purchaser of the
		      Company or its assets, solely for the purposes of continuation of the
		       cashU service, or similar. Otherwise we will only disclose your information
		        to a third-party with your EXPLICIT permission<br>
		        Suspicion of Money Laundering, Fraud or Other Illegal Activity<br>
		     To ensure that cashU is not used for Money Laundering, Fraud or Other Illegal Activity,
		      we may monitor user behaviour and transactions. Where we suspect such activity we
		      will not normally tell the user of our suspicions. We will also report to the
		      competent authorities, normally without prior or subsequent notice to the user,
		      any information on the user relating to actual or suspected money laundering,
		       fraud and other illegal activity where we are required by law to do so. <br><br>
		        <b>Control of Personal Information</b> <br>
		        If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your phone,
		        email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide
		        a way to correct and update that user's personally identifiable information,
		        as provided to us. This can be done via our website, or as a last resort by
		        e-mailing us on <a href="mailto:info@cashU.com">info@cashU.com</a>.
		        In order to deactivate your account you will need to contact our support
		        team via the website or via <a href="mailto:info@cashU.com">info@cashU.com</a>. However, please understand
		        we cannot completely delete user information because of legal/regulatory
		        and technical back up requirements.
		        <br><br>
		        <b>Communication</b>
		        Upon registration every user will receive an email confirming his successful
		        registration. Established members will occasionally receive
		        information on products, services and special deals via newsletter.
		         Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to
		          not receive these types of communications and this choice can be made
		          at the time of registration. Should the user wish to change their choice
		          after registration they can e-mail <a href="mailto:info@cashU.com">info@cashU.com</a>.
		          <br><br>

		          that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement

		          <b>Click-through URLs</b>
		          <br>
		          We may occasionally use a 'click-through URL'. When you click one of these URLs,
		          you pass through our web server before arriving at your final destination.
		          We track click-throughs to help us improve the user experience, determine your
		          interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.<br><br>
		          <b>Competitions</b> <br>
		          Competitions may be made available on our site from time to time. You do not have
		          to participate in these, however if choose to you may be asked to disclose some
		          Personal Information. At the time of entering the competition it will be made clear
		          to you who will have access to your Personal Information and why. You are not obliged
		           to continue with your competition entry, however if you do so you accept that
		           you may receive a prize.<br><br>
		           <b>Security</b><br>

		           cashU secures your account information from unauthorised access, use or
		           disclosure. You must enter your username and password each time you want to
		            access your account or make transactions. Never share your account details
		             with anyone. If you are concerned that your password has been compromised,
		              you can change it any time you like once you are logged on. Your account
		               login, personal details and all transactions are secured using Secure
		                Socket Layer (SSL) technology with high security 128bit encryption,
		                 certified by thawte. <br>
