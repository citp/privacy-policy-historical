You should ensure the email address you have registered with us is always correct, so that we can always contact you with important information regarding your account. 
For certain optional transactions, we also collect selected financial information such as credit card details. For transaction volumes over a certain limit, we are legally required to report some personally identifiable information to the authorities. For verification purposes we reserve the right to request proof of identification in an offline format. Your IP address and access times may be tracked against your user id for the dual purposes of preventing fraud and creating an audit trail when using the cashU service.<br><br></div><div class="mart_10"><b>Use of Personal Information</b><br><br>We only use your personal information to service your account and to improve our services to you. However, we do share some financial information as part of normal business operations with banks or credit card processing and verification services.

any information on the user relating to actual or suspected money laundering, fraud and other illegal activity where we are required by law to do so.<br><br></div><div class="mart_10"><b>Control of Personal Information</b><br><br>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct and update that user's personally identifiable information, as provided to us.
