</span>We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously.<span>&nbsp; </span>Unless you directly give us consent to do otherwise, Catch will only collect and use your personal information as set out below.</span></p><p class="MsoBodyText"><strong><span>Collection of information</span></strong></p><p class="MsoBodyText"><span>The four main ways we collect personal information about you are:</span></p><ul><li><span>when information about you is posted on a Catch website, either by you or by a third party; </span></li><li><span>when you log into a Catch website or otherwise submit personal information to Catch; </span></li><li><span>when you use a Catch website, in which case our system automatically collects information relating to your visit to that website, such as your IP address; and</span></li><li><span>through the operation of CatchBot, Catch's web crawler (described in more detail below).</span></li></ul><br><p class="MsoBodyText"><strong><span>Our use of cookies</span></strong></p><p class="MsoBodyText"><span>Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies.<span>&nbsp; </span>Catch uses cookies to make your use of our website and services as convenient as possible.<span>&nbsp; </span>Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's browser.<span>&nbsp; </span>Cookies are useful to estimate our number of users and determine overall traffic patterns through our website.</span></p><p class="MsoBodyText"><span>If you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies.<span>&nbsp; </span>This may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of Catch's services.</span></p><p class="MsoBodyText"><strong><span>Using and disclosing your personal information</span></strong></p><p class="MsoBodyText"><span>Our purpose in collecting information about you is to: </span></p><ul><li><span>provide you with a better service experience with content and advertising that is more relevant</span><span> to your interests; and</span></li><li><span>create a business information database for use as part of Catch's online business.<span>&nbsp; </span>Whilst Catch's business information database is designed to operate as a business directory (not a directory of individuals) it is possible that personal information may become included in the business information database.</span></li></ul><br><p class="MsoBodyText"><span>Catch will not use or disclose any information about you without your consent, unless:</span></p><ul><li><span>the use or disclosure is for one of the purposes described above or otherwise permitted by this policy;</span></li><li><span>it is required or permitted by law (including by relevant privacy laws);</span></li><li><span>we believe it necessary to provide you with a service which you have requested;</span></li><li><span>to protect the rights, property or personal safety of another Catch website user, any member of the public or Catch;
