<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

Date last modified: September 17, 2012 <br>
<br>
Padopolis, Inc. ("Padopolis") provides this Privacy Policy to
inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection,
use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of
our software applications (including any updates, new versions or
new releases thereof) for use on mobile devices (such as Apple's
iPad) or on social network services (each a "Padopolis
Application"), our websites including without limitation those
located at <a href="http://www.padopolis.com">www.padopolis.com</a>, <a href="http://www.catalogspree.com">www.catalogspree.com</a> and
<a href="http://shop.catalogspree.com/">shop.catalogspree.com</a> (collectively, the "Site") and any other
services offered by Padopolis in connection with a Padopolis
Application or the Site (any and all of the foregoing the
"Services"). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that
you provide to us through the Services. 

<h3>Information Collection: Personally Identifiable
Information</h3>

<ul>
<li>In the course of using the Services, we may ask you to provide
us with certain personally identifiable information that can be
used to contact or identify you and administer your use and
enjoyment of the Services ("Personal Information"). Personal
Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, and
email address. We use your Personal Information primarily to
provide the Services and administer your inquiries. For example,
when you choose to interact with and use certain social networking
services ("SNSs") via the Services we collect the user credentials
for your SNS account which typically includes your email
address.</li>

<li>We may also collect the other information that you provide as
part of registration and the administration and personalization of
your user experience (such as zip code or location and individual
preferences) ("Non-Identifying Information").</li>

<li>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction
with your Non-Identifying Information) primarily to provide the
Services and administer your inquiries.</li>

<li>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part
of your Personal Information if it were combined with other
identifiers (such as combining your zip code with your street
address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same
pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information
when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-
identifying information (such as your viewing preferences). We may
combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information
and aggregate it with information collected from other Padopolis
users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to
improve the Services and to analyze and understand how the Services
are used. We may also use the combined information without
aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance, to deliver
a product to you according to your preferences or
restrictions.</li>

<li>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with
Padopolis newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other
information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any
time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from
us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of
the communications.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Device IDs</h3>

When you launch a Padopolis Application, we collect the unique
device ID issued by Apple for your iPad or other manufacturer for
other mobile devices ("Device ID") and IP address, if applicable.
We use and store your Device ID to enable you to interact with and
use our Services and the SNS you may choose to access through them
and to make it possible to authenticate and understand the use of
our Services. We link your Device ID with the technical information
accessed through your use of the Services which enables us to
administer resets to your account or to delete information when you
request that we do so or for other administrative purposes. 

<h3>Surveys and Promotions</h3>

From time to time, we may provide you the opportunity to
participate in surveys, contests or offers (any of these a
"Promotion") via our Site or Services. If you participate in a
Promotion we will request certain Personal Information from you. We
use the Personal Information you provide to us in these instances
to administer your participation in the Promotion. Participation in
a Promotion is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice
whether or not to disclose this information. We may share Personal
Information with those third parties who need that information in
order to fulfill a Promotion. 

<h3>Log Data</h3>

When you use our Services (such as when you visit our Site or
interact with a Padopolis Application), our servers automatically
record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a
website or service connected to the Internet ("Log Data"). This Log
Data may include information such as your computer's, iPad's or
other mobile device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser
type, the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site,
pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages,
sections of our applications that you access, information you
search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other
statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of
the Site and Services for technical administration and tailoring
our Services to our users' needs. 

<h3>Our Policy Toward Children</h3>

IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS
THE SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. Protecting the privacy
of young children is especially important. For that reason,
Padopolis does not knowingly collect or maintain personally
identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age. If
Padopolis learns that personally-identifiable information of
persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through
the Services, then Padopolis will take the appropriate steps to
delete this information. If you are the parent or legal guardian of
a child under 13 who uses the Services, then please contact
Padopolis info@padopolis.com to have that child's information
deleted. 

<h3>Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>

Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A
cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's
hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We may use "persistent
cookies" to save a username and login password for future logins to
the Site. We also may use "session ID cookies" to enable certain
features of the Site or Services, to better understand how you
interact with the Site and to monitor web traffic routing on the
Site and aggregate usage of the Site and Services. You can instruct
your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or
to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you
visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able
to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the
Services. We may also use "pixel tags," "web beacons", "clear GIFs"
or similar means (individually or collectively "Pixel Tags") in
connection with our Services to collect usage, demographic and
geographical location data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image,
often a single pixel, that is ordinarily not visible to users and
may be associated with cookies on a user's hard drive. Pixel Tags
allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site,
to deliver branded services and to help determine the effectiveness
of promotional or advertising campaigns. 

<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

We will not share, sell, rent, or trade your Personal Information
with other parties except as provided below: 

<h3>Padopolis App Users</h3>

As a Padopolis user who accesses the Services you can interact with
and use SNSs including but not limited to services like Facebook
and Twitter. By using an SNS via the Services you understand and
agree that Padopolis will access and store your SNS account
information so that it is available to you through your use of the
Padopolis Application. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE
SECRECY OF ANY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORDS AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT
ALL TIMES. 

<h3>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</h3>

We may share aggregated information that includes non-identifying
information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis,
demographic profiling, and to deliver targeted advertising about
other products and services. Any aggregated information shared in
these contexts will not contain your Personal Information. 

<h3>Services Providers</h3>

We employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our
Services (such as maintenance services, database management, web
analytics and improvement of our Services' features), to provide
the Services on our behalf, or to assist us in analyzing how
Services are used. These third parties have access to your Personal
Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are
obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. 

<h3>Based on Your Consent</h3>

As discussed above, we share your Personal Information in order
to fulfill Promotions in which you have agreed to participate.
Similarly, we share such Personal Information that you may make
publicly available (such as your photo) in connection with items
that you have elected to share or post through our Services (such
as items of merchandise that have chosen as your
"Favorites" or in your "Collections").


<h3>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h3>

We may disclose any information about you if required to do so by
law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to
comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or
respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or
warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity. Padopolis
also reserves the right to disclose information that we believe, in
good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against
liability; protect Padopolis from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful
uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party
claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies;
to protect the security or integrity of the Services; enforce our
Terms of Use; or to protect the rights, property, or personal
safety of Padopolis, our users, or others. 

<h3>Business Transfers</h3>

Padopolis may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its
assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a
merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the
event of bankruptcy. 

<h3>Security</h3>

We are concerned with the security of your Personal Information and
are committed to taking reasonable steps to protect it from
unauthorized access and use. To that end, we put in place the
appropriate physical, electronic and managerial policies and
procedures designed to secure Personal Information. We also
continue to implement procedures to maintain accurate, complete and
current Personal Information. No method of transmission over the
Internet, or method of electronic storage, is one hundred percent
secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable
means to protect Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
absolute security. We will make any legally required disclosures of
any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your
unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in
applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you
via email or conspicuous posting on the Site in the most expedient
time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent
with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any
measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore
the reasonable integrity of the data system. 

<h3>Phishing</h3>

Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are
of great concern to Padopolis. Safeguarding information to help
protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and
will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your
account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a
non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For
more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade
Commission's website. 

<h3>International Transfer</h3>

Your information may be transferred to -and maintained on-
computers located outside of your state, province, country or other
governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as
protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located
outside the United States and choose to provide information to us,
Padopolis transfers Personal Information to the United States and
processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy through
your use of the Services followed by your submission of such
information represents your agreement to that transfer. 

<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>

Our Services contains links to other websites and online services.
If you choose to visit a catalog publisher, third party service or
an advertiser by "clicking on" a shopping cart link, banner ad or
other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link,
you will be directed to that third party's website or online
service. The fact that we link to a website, content or present a
banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement,
authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third
party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information
security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over
third party websites or services. These other websites or services
may place their own cookies or other files on your computer,
collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other
websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or
disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We
encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the
other websites and services you use. 

<h3>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h3>

This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically, and this will be
reflected by a "last modified" date below. Please revisit this page
to stay aware of any changes. Our amended Privacy Policy will
automatically take effect, except that (i) we will not, without
your consent, use your previously collected personally identifiable
information in a manner inconsistent Privacy Policy in effect when
we received that information, and (ii) if you do not agree with any
changes to the Privacy Policy, you may terminate your account
ceasing use of the Services. 

<h3>Padopolis Contact Information</h3>

Please contact Padopolis with any questions or comments about this
Privacy Policy, your personal information, and our third-party
disclosure practices at: Padopolis, Inc., 4962 El Camino Real,
Suite 218 Los Altos, CA 94022, USA or by email at
