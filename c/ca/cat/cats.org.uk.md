  * keeping you up-to-date on CP’s news such as fundraising campaigns, challenges, achievements etc
  * enabling third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other legitimate functions on our behalf, or
  * conducting research on the demographics, interests and behaviour of our supporters to enable a better understanding of your requirements.

  * making a decision, on the basis of a supporter’s level of giving and postcode, whether to send different communications to people who might choose to give higher donations. Where a supporter is identified as being potentially able and willing to give more than they already do, we may try to build a better understanding of how they might want to support us. To do this we conduct in-house research and may use additional, publicly-available information from third party sources where it is available, such as Companies House and Land Registry records. This allows us to make sure we are spending your donations effectively, by using research and analysis to inform our decisions and ensure our conversations with you provide the best supporter experience possible
