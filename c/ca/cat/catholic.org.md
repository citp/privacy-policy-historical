* Tracking Technologies.   
CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC or its third parties may use tracking technologies, such as cookies and Web Beacons, to collect information about users who visit or use the Site and view or interact with Advertisements, Content, Promotions or Services on or through the Site.

* 4.1 Cookies. CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC uses "cookies" to help you access and navigate the Site more efficiently and to statistically monitor how many people are using the Site.   
a. A "cookie" is a small file or tool stored on your computer or device containing information that allows CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC to deliver customized information to you. CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC uses both "session" and "persistent" cookies on the Site. Session cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser or turn off your computer or device.

Persistent cookies store information on your computer or device for a number of reasons, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (i.e., username and password), helping to determine what areas of the Site you find most valuable and customizing the Site based on your preferences on an ongoing basis.   
b. You may set your browser to notify you of or decline the receipt of cookies. Certain features of the Site, including certain Content, Promotions or Services, may not, however, function properly or be available if your browser is configured to disable cookies. Many companies offer programs that help you to visit web sites anonymously. While CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC cannot recognize you, CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC wants you to be aware that these programs are available.

* 4.2 Web Beacons. During your use of the Site, you may encounter Web Beacons, which may come from CATHOLIC ONLINE, LLC or from third parties that display or provide Advertisements, Content, Promotions or Services on the Site.   
a. A "Web Beacon" (sometimes also called a "web bug" or "clear gif") is a small graphic image in a web page, a web-based document or an email message that generally allows the party that set the Web Beacon to monitor certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document or email message and may allow access to certain cookies. Web Beacons are usually invisible to the user because they are very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel). In general, however, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an Advertisement or Content, can act as a Web Beacon.   
b. Web Beacons on the Site typically collect the URL of the page from which the Web Beacon originates, the type of browser requesting the Web Beacon, the IP address of the computer or Device ID of the device to which the Web Beacon is sent and the time that the Web Beacon was viewed.

Certain Web Beacons used by third party advertisers, content providers or other service providers may collect information that allows such third parties to determine how many people are viewing and/or clicking on certain Advertisements or viewing certain Content, Promotions or Services for purposes of helping these parties serve and manage their Advertisements, Content, Promotions and Services.
