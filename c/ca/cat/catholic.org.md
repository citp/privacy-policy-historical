# Catholic Online - Privacy Notice

Catholic Online Statement of Privacy  
This document was last updated May 1, 2001. 

At Catholic Online, we are committed to protecting your privacy and to developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience. You can travel through most of our site without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use in those situations. Please read the complete Catholic Online privacy statement. 

  
**Collecting your Personal Information**  
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are asked to register before entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access premium site, or when purchasing and registering Catholic Online products. Personal information collected by Catholic Online often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested. 

For example: If you choose to make a purchase in Catholic Online Shopping, we will request personal information such as: name, address, telephone number, credit card number and shipping information. 

When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we keep this registration information on file with any information you've already given us on previous visits to our Web site. This is considered your personal profile. 

  
**Use of your Personal Information**  
We use your personal information for four primary purposes:   


  * To make the site easier for you to use by not making you enter your personal information more than once.   

  * To help you quickly find Information, services and software, on Catholic Online.   

  * To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you.   

  * To alert you to new features, new content areas, product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from Catholic Online.



We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

Catholic Online will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Catholic Online or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Catholic Online and its family of Web sites, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Catholic Online, its Web sites, or the public. 

  
**Control of your Personal Information**  
When you register, or otherwise give us personal information, Catholic Online will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above. 

Registering also allows you to tell us how or whether you want Catholic Online to communicate with you. There, you can decide what information you want to receive and how you want to receive it. Or you can tell us not to contact you. 

Catholic Online occasionally allows other companies to offer our registered customers information about their products and services. If you do not want to receive these offers, please let us know or uncheck any boxes for that purpose.  
Catholic Online may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service issues related to a product or service you requested. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered an essential part of the service you have chosen. 

  
**Access to your Personal Information**  
We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may update this information at any time by sending email to colirf@catholic.org

  * Choose whether you want third parties to send you their offers by e-mail.   

  * Subscribe or cancel subscriptions to newsletters about our services and products.
