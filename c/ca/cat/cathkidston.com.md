## Use of Cookies

  
We use cookies to administer our Website. We will not use cookies in combination with your Personal Information without your prior consent. A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value. If you have previously registered on the Website (i.e. the website at [http://www.cathkidston.co.uk](http://www.cathkidston.co.uk/)) cookies will enable the Website to recognise you. Cookies can help a website to arrange content to match your preferred interests more quickly and are used by most major websites.

Two types of cookies are used on this Website: session cookies and persistent cookies.

Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Website. We use session cookies:

(a) to track the number of visits to the Website;  
(b) to compile anonymous statistics that allow us to understand how users use our Website such as details of the pages visited per session on the Website and the number of return visits to the Website (we cannot identify you persnally in this way);  
(c) to enable basic personalisation of the Website;  
(d) to keep track of your current shopping session so that you may retrieve your shopping basket at any time;  
(e) within the user id sign in session for security; and,  
(f) to remember if a user has signed out.

Persistent cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer than session cookies. We use one persistent cookie which is stored to enable the Website to determine whether you have been here and signed in previously. This helps to authenticate you as a registered user, giving you access to your user profile and certain otherwise inaccessible areas of the Website.
