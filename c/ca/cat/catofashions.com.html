            <p><strong>Links to other sites through catofashions.com</strong></p>
            <p> Our web site may link to other web sites that may be of interest 
              to you. These web sites have their own privacy, security, and terms 
              of use statements. The Cato Corporation is not responsible for the 
              policies or content of linked sites and we encourage you to review 
              policies before providing personal information.</p>
            <p><strong> Data Security</strong></p>
            <p> The Cato Corporation is committed to providing reasonable and 
              appropriate technical, administrative and physical safeguards to 
              protect against foreseeable hazards such as data loss, destruction, 
              misuse and improper disclosure. </p>
            <p>Online information is protected by the use of Secure Sockets Layer 
              (SSL) technology. You can check the security of your connection 
              by looking at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window 
              after accessing the server. An unbroken key or a closed lock (depending 
              on your browser) means the SSL is active and the server is secure. 
              You can also look at the URL address. If the first characters of 
              the site address change from "http" to "https," 
              then you have accessed a secure server.</p>
            <p>Some firewalls and versions of browsers do not allow communication 
              through secure servers. In that case, you won't be able to process 
              your information through an insecure connection. If you cannot access 
              the secure server for any reason, please print the form, fill it 
              out and mail to: The Cato Corporation, 8100 Denmark Road, Charlotte,
