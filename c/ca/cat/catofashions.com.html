                  <p>The Cato Corporation's credit card program is administered
                    through Cedar Hill National Bank. Cedar Hill National Bank

                    in the proper handling of your nonpublic personal information,
                    to have access to your nonpublic personal information; <br>
                    (4) will attempt to keep your files complete, up-to-date,
                    and accurate, and will tell you how to notify Cedar Hill

                  <p><b> Data Security</b></p>
                  <p> The Cato Corporation is committed to providing reasonable
                    and appropriate technical, administrative and physical safeguards
                    to protect against foreseeable hazards such as data loss,
                    destruction, misuse and improper disclosure. </p>
                  <p>Online information is protected by the use of Secure Sockets
                    Layer (SSL) technology. You can check the security of your
                    connection by looking at the lower left-hand corner of your
                    browser window after accessing the server. An unbroken key
                    or a closed lock (depending on your browser) means the SSL
                    is active and the server is secure. You can also look at
                    the URL address. If the first characters of the site address
                    change from "http" to "https," 
                    then you have accessed a secure server.</p>
                  <p>Some firewalls and versions of browsers do not allow communication
                    through secure servers. In that case, you won't be able to
                    process your information through an insecure connection.
                    If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please
                    print the form, fill it out and mail to: The Cato Corporation,

                  <p><b> Children's Policy</b></p>
                  <p> The Cato Corporation will never knowingly request personally
                    identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13,

                    Act of 1998.</p>
                  <p>If we become aware that a subscriber is under the age of
                    13, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration
                    information from our files. Please note: we may maintain
                    record of the person's name and address in a "do not
