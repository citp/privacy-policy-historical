WHY DOES CATEX COLLECT THIS INFORMATION

To provide and maintain our services

We use the information collected to deliver our services and verify user identity.

We use IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse such as spam, phishing and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

To communicate with you

We use personal information collected, like an email address to interact with users directly when providing customer support on a ticket or to keep you informed on log ins, transations, and security.
