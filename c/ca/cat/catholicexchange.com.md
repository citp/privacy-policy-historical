# Privacy Policy

Catholic Exchange provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information we receive through our website at www.CatholicExchange.com (“Catholic Exchange”), as well as through our Internet tracking service, which collects data across the Web through the Catholic Exchange Code, as described below (the “Services”). This Privacy Policy applies to information that you provide to us when you use our Services as a member of our “Publisher” or “Advertiser” Program, as well as when you access or use any information or content appearing on Catholic Exchange, whether as a “Registered User” or as a non-registered user just browsing Catholic Exchange (a “Visitor”). This Privacy Policy also explains what type of information is collected if you visit third party websites serving content tagged by Publishers or Advertisers with Catholic Exchange Code. We may change the Privacy Policy from time to time. Please consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any updates.

Personally Identifiable Information means information about you that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally Identifiable Information may include, but is not limited to, your username, your name, phone number, email address and home and business postal addresses.

### Information Collection and Use

  * For Publishers and Advertisers, we use your Personally Identifiable Information mainly to provide the Services to you, as applicable, and to administer your inquiries. We may also use your Personally Identifiable Information to contact you with Catholic Exchange newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.
  * If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you.
  * “Log Data” means information sent by your browser such as your computer’s IP address, pixel code, referring HTTP location, search string, time of the access, browser’s time, any searches made on the applicable website, and other statistics.
  * When you visit Catholic Exchange, whether as a Publisher, Advertiser, or Visitor, our servers automatically record and collect Log Data sent by your browser. We use the Log Data to monitor and analyze the use of Catholic Exchange and the Services, for Catholic Exchange’s technical administration, to increase Catholic Exchange’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit Catholic Exchange again, it will recognize you and will be able to serve content, advertisements, and other information appropriate to your interests.
  * We also collect Log Data each time you visit third-party websites serving content that has been tagged by Publishers or Advertisers with Catholic Exchange Code. We analyze such Log Data and combine it between sites and with other data and information to produce the Reports that are made available on Catholic Exchange, and to enable Catholic Exchange’s usage based licensing models. This combined data is also used by us and our partners to serve you content, advertisements, and other information tailored to your interests.
  * We do not link Log Data to any other Personally Identifiable Information about you or otherwise attempt to discover your identity. We make efforts to require our Publishers and Advertisers to ensure that any such third party website post adequate privacy policies and otherwise protect the privacy rights of their visitors. Check the privacy policies of websites tagged with Catholic Exchange Code for information regarding the applicable privacy practices. Some of the advertisements that appear on Licensed Content may be delivered to you by third party Internet advertising companies. These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visit to or use of Catholic Exchange Services, including information about the ads they display, via a cookie placed on your computer that reads your IP address. To opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please email [editor@CatholicExchange.com](mailto:editor@CatholicExchange.com).

Catholic Exchange, including, but not limited to, the section where Reports are displayed, contains links to other websites. If you choose to click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from you. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
