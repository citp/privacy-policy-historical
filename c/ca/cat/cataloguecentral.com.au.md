# Catalogue Central

Catalogue Central Pty Limited trading as iNC Digital Media and their related businesses (iNC, our, us, we) respect your right to privacy.

We are sensitive to the concerns that our clients, customers and online users may have with regard to the confidentiality, security and use of their personal information. iNC is committed to the protection of your personal information and would like to reassure you of our position on this matter. iNC has developed this Privacy Policy in line with the ‘Australian Privacy Principles’ (APPs) as established under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to tell you what type of information we collect, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, the opportunities you have to access and correct the information we hold, and how you may make a complaint about a breach of the APPs.

We encourage you to check this policy regularly as this policy may change from time to time. If you have any suggestions or concerns that are not addressed in this policy, please contact us. Please take some time to read through this policy and understand our position on privacy before you provide us with any personal information.

### Our Commitment to privacy

Aside from the contents of this policy, the conduct of iNC is governed by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and in particular the APPs.

### Personal information we may collect

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that protect your personal information. Only authorised Catalogue Central staff have access to your personal information. Information is only accessible when required in the normal course of business from Catalogue Central.

This policy applies to: 

  * End users who are served advertisements through our advertising technologies and services (Ad Network);
  * Website publishers and/or advertisers who use our Ad Network; and
  * Individuals who visit websites under our control, including:   

    * [www.cataloguecentral.com.au](http://www.cataloguecentral.com.au/)
    * [www.incdigitalmedia.com](http://www.incdigitalmedia.com/)



iNC will only collect personal information about you if it is reasonably necessary for our functions and activities. When submitting information to us, or using our Ad Network we may collect details such as your name, gender, email, phone number, the company for which you work, and in some instances, your financial information (including credit card information) which may personally identify you. Some of this information is essential for us to be able to identify accurately who is using our services so that we may be able to respond to your requests and, as such, is indicated by mandatory fields. Mandatory information requirements are clearly identified and are denoted by an asterisk (*). When submitting a form, you will also be prompted if any mandatory data has not been completed. Other types of information are collected to help us provide better services. Information of this type is optional – you need only fill it in if you wish to do so.

You may be asked to provide iNC with personal information when you: 

  * Register with one of our Sites, use one of our Sites or our Ad Network;
  * Create an account with us;
  * Send us your comments, suggestions or other information;
  * Report a technical problem;
  * Request sales and advertising information;
  * Subscribe to a newsletter or catalogue; or
  * Enter a competition, promotion or event.



We also collect personal information in the normal course of business through meetings, phone calls, letters, faxes and emails, as well as via third party credit agencies, mailing lists, advertisers, commercial agreements, documents and dealings. All this information is subject to the APPs.

In addition, we may also collect information about you if you: 

  * post comments or submit content which is publicly available which contains information about you – this may include information such as your name, user name, likes, tweets, status, profile information and pictures; and
  * log-in to or access one of our Sites, services or activities through a third party social media service or connect one of our Sites, services or activities to a third party social media service - this may include information such as your user ID, user name, information you have disclosed via the social media service and information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us (for example your profile picture, email address, followers or friends lists). 



When you engage in the activities described above, you are authorising us to collect, store, use and disclose such information and content in accordance with this policy.

iNC will not collect sensitive information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or details of health, disability or sexual activity or orientation. However if we do collect sensitive information we will do so in compliance with the APPs.

You have the option of not identifying yourself or dealing with us using a pseudonym in relation to particular matters. We will endeavour to make it clear where you may withhold your name or use a pseudonym.

### Non-personal information we may collect

iNC may also collect non-personal information, such as your IP address or your browsing patterns, by using cookies on its Sites or websites controlled by our Related Companies and Partners. Cookies do not personally identify you, but assign a unique number to the visitor to track user navigation and customise Site information to further improve the user experience on an aggregate and anonymous basis. Cookies can make using iNC's Sites easier and better - for example by storing information about your preferences on a Site. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you'll find most major websites use them. One way to prevent the use of cookies is to activate the facility which is available in most web browsers that enables the user to deny or accept cookies

We may combine your personal information with non-personal information about you that we collect so as to provide you with the services listed below.

### How we use your information

If we hold personal information about you that was collected for a particular purpose, we will not use or disclose it for another purpose unless: (a) you consent; (b) you would reasonably expect us to use or disclose it for that other purpose; or (c) it is required or authorised by law or a court/tribunal order.

iNC generally uses personal information, and you consent to us using your personal information, to: 

  * provide you with catalogues, products or services you have requested;
  * provide you with relevant advertising and promotional material;
  * conduct promotions or competitions, including Joint Activities;
  * help iNC manage and enhance its services, Sites and Ad Network;
  * communicate with you; or
  * use our Ad Network to send you ongoing information and promotional material about opportunities, services and products (relating to our business or a third party business) in which iNC believes you may be interested, including via email, SMS or mail.



We may also share your personal information with our Related Companies, Partners and others, as referred to below.

The information and feedback you provide through our Sites and Ad Network may be used to identify ways of improving the Sites and Ad Network and how we can make them more effective for your use.

### Opting in or out and unsubscribing

At the time we collect information from you, you may be asked to "opt in" to consent to us using or disclosing your personal information, other than in accordance with this policy or any applicable law. For example, you may be asked to “opt-in” to receive further information or communications from us, our Related Companies or our Partners, as referred to below.

You will be given the opportunity to "opt out" or unsubscribe from receiving communications from us, our Related Companies or our Partners in accordance with this policy. Alternatively, you may contact us at the address below to “opt out” of, or unsubscribe from, any future communications.
