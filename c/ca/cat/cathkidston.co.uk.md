# AddThis - Privacy Policy

#### Our commitment to privacy

Welcome to AddThis, the #1 bookmarking and sharing button on the Internet. AddThis ("AddThis", "we" or "our") has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of information about users of AddThis bookmarking, sharing button and other services that we may develop (collectively "Services"). This privacy policy applies to information that you provide to us when you use our Service on your website (an "AddThis Client") and also when you simply access our Services on a third party website, whether as a registered or non-registered user of our Services (an "AddThis Visitor").

Below we provide you with our privacy policy, where we intend to be transparent about any information we collect, how we intend to use the information, and what choices you have when you register with us and use our website or Services.

#### Our privacy policy in short:

  * Your privacy remains under your control
  * We will only use personal information you provide us according to the terms of this privacy policy
  * In order to use certain features of our platform, you will provide a limited amount of personal information
  * We will never disclose your personally-identifiable information to any third party without your consent or unless we are required to so by law
  * You can cancel your AddThis account at any time



#### What information do we collect?

During use of our website and Services, we collect various types of data, usage statistics, demographic and preference information and other personal information as described below.

When registering on our website or using certain features of our Services, we may collect Personally Identifiable Information about you. "Personally Identifiable Information" means information about you that may include, but is not limited to your username and email address.

#### AddThis Clients

In order to use certain Services on your website, we require AddThis Clients to provide certain Personally Identifiable Information, including username, password and email address, when first becoming an AddThis Client. We may also request additional Personally Identifiable Information from time to time thereafter. Providing such additional Personally Identifiable Information is entirely optional, although some of our Services may not function without such information.

For AddThis Clients, we use your Personally Identifiable Information mainly to provide the Services to you, as applicable, to track and provide analytics, and to administer your inquiries. We may also use your Personally Identifiable Information to contact you with AddThis newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.

#### AddThis Visitors

If you are simply using or accessing our website or Services as an AddThis Visitor, you may be required to register and/or to submit certain Personally Identifiable Information to us. Registration information may include but is not limited to user name, password, email address, as well as any other information that you decide to provide us with. In addition, if you use certain features of the Services, such as sharing content via our email feature, you will be required to include Personally Identifiable Information to us such as your email address and the email address of the person who is receiving the content.

In addition, we collect certain information which cannot be used to personally identify any user, and which may be provided to third parties. Such non-personal data ordinarily includes non-identifiable aggregate, summary, usage data, and other behavioral data and may include, by way of example, statistics regarding total users, information regarding types of Internet browsers used by users, and behavioral usage patterns. We also collect non-personal data about each user's IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our website and Services.

#### Log Data

"Log Data" means information sent by your browser including, but not limited to your computer's IP address, referring HTTP address, current HTTP address, time of the access and other statistics.

When you visit our website or use our Services, our servers automatically record and collect Log Data sent by your browser. We use the Log Data to monitor and analyze the use of our website and Services, for technical administration, to increase our website and Service's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Services to our users needs.

We also collect Log Data each time you visit third-party websites serving content that uses our Services. We analyze Log Data from different websites and combine it with other non Personally Identifiable Information to produce reports and data that are made available on our website, to enable AddThis, web publishers and advertisers to deliver advertising and/or programming that are appropriate for their products or services. This combined data is also used by us and our partners to serve you advertisements and other information tailored to your interests.

We do not link Log Data to any other Personally Identifiable Information about you or otherwise attempt to discover your identity. When an AddThis Visitor distributes content via our email functionality, we only retain email address information in our Log Data for up to ninety (90) days. We make efforts to require our AddThis Clients to ensure that any such third party website post adequate privacy policies and otherwise protect the privacy rights of their visitors. Check the privacy policies of websites using our Services for information regarding the applicable privacy practices.

#### Minors

Any AddThis Visitor providing personal data is certifying that he/she is over the age of 13. As such, we do not collect or maintain personal data from individuals we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our website or Service is designed to attract people under 13. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. Thus, if we ever obtain knowledge that that a user is under 13, we will take steps to remove that user's personal data from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the website and Services.

#### Cookies

Like many websites and platforms, we use cookies on our website and Services (by placing or reading them via your browser) to save your registration information for future logins. We also utilize cookies to enable certain features of our website and Services to better understand how you interact with our Services and to monitor usage and web traffic routing on our website and Services. Third party advertisers may also place or read cookies on your browser. We also use cookies when you visit our website and Services to collect Log Data, as described in the Log Data section above. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting browser cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. In addition, we use Flash cookies in connection with our Services. Similar to browser cookies, Flash cookies are used to remember settings, preferences and usage, but are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. If you want to delete Flash cookies, please access your Flash Player settings management tool available on Adobe's web site. However, if you do not accept cookies (whether browser or Flash cookies), you may not be able to use all portions of our website or all functionality of the Services.

#### Cookie opt-out option

If you prefer not to receive interest based content and advertisements enabled by AddThis data, you can always opt-out by clicking on our "Opt-Out" link [click here](https://web.archive.org/marketing-preferences). Note that if Flash is not installed in your browser, this marketing preference is not applicable.

After you opt-out, you will not receive interest based content and targeted advertisements enabled by AddThis data. Please note that opting-out does not turn off other advertisements. Also, if you change your computer, change your internet browser (e.g. from Internet Explorer to Firefox), or delete all your cookies, you will need to renew your preferences.

The foregoing opt-out does not cover the collection of Log Data (though no ads are sent to you in connection with such services).

#### How do we use and disclose collected information?

We do not share Personally Identifiable Information collected on our website and Services, including email addresses, with third parties for their direct marketing or solicitation.

Log Data and Usage Information. We may use your information (a) to deliver the AddThis services and features desired by you (including any customization features requested by you), (b) to improve our services to you, (c) to personalize content and offers that may be of interest to you, (d) to respond to your inquiries, and (e) to fulfill your request for products or services. We may use non-Personally Identifiable Information, like your IP address, to analyze statistical site usage and to customize our site's content, layout and Services. We may share the following information with third parties, including, but not limited to, vendors that support the operation of our website and Services, and entities involved in the delivery of advertisements: Log Data collected on both our websites and Services, as well as aggregated anonymous information resulting from the analysis of such Log Data for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to, usage patterns, behavioral patterns, traffic and demographic analysis, and enabling web publishers to deliver to advertisers audience segments that are appropriate for their products or services.

Unsolicited Information. In addition to your username, any comments or submissions ("Unsolicited Information") that you post to our website or Services will be publicly available. All such Unsolicited Information will be deemed to be non-confidential and AddThis will be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution. You should be aware that, if you voluntarily disclose Unsolicited Information online, that Unsolicited Information can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address in comments sections or online forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from others. AddThis has no control over the use of Personally Identifiable Information that you voluntarily post in public forums or otherwise disclose while interacting with other users. Any such Personally Identifiable Information you choose to disclose should reflect how much you want other users to know about you. We encourage our AddThis Clients and AddThis Visitors to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their comments or submissions.

Third Party Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform services related to administration of our website and Services (including, without limitation, maintenance, hosting and database management services, and administration). These third parties have access to your Personally Identifiable Information and Log Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

Compliance with Law. AddThis cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We disclose Personally Identifiable Information and Log Data to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of AddThis or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being illegal or legally actionable.

Business Transfers. AddThis may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personally Identifiable Information and Log Data, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity's planned processing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.

#### International transfer

Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to AddThis, please be advised that we transfer Personally Identifiable Information to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this privacy policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

#### Links to Other Sites

Our website and Services contain links to other third party websites and services. If you choose to click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website or service. The fact that we link to a website or service is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites or services. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from you. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

#### Our commitment to data security

Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information in our possession and control, no security system can prevent against all potential security breaches, and we bear no liability for uses or disclosures of personal data or non-personal data arising in connection with the theft thereof. Likewise, you are responsible for safeguarding the confidentiality of passwords to our website and Services, and we bear no liability for access to, or use or disclosure of personal data if such access, use or disclosure arises in connection with the theft or disclosure (whether intentional or negligent) of such user's password.

#### Changes to this policy

If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on the Site so that users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we will disclose it. Any such posted changes will be effective upon the date indicated by the posting. Your continued access to and/or use of the Site or our services constitutes your assent to, and acceptance of, this policy, including all posted changes for which we have provided notice.
