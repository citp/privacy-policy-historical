PII is any information that can be used to specifically identify you as an individual. For example, you may submit and we may collect your name, email address, address, phone number, or similar information through the Site. Non-PII consists of information that does not specifically identify you. The following section describes how we collect and use your PII and Non-PII. 

**What This Means: We collect both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information.**

**How We Collect and Use Information**  


_Cookies and Beacons_  
Like all websites, we use cookies and other technologies, including web beacons, so that we can enhance your user experience. Web beacons and cookies collect information such as URLs you came from and go to, your browser and OS information, your IP address, your mobile provider, your mobile device, and your ISP. None of the information collected by our cookies or web beacons is PII. 

Cookies are bits of data placed on your hard drive when you visit websites. A cookie file contains information that can identify you anonymously and maintain your account's privacy. We use cookies to maintain your identity between sessions so that the Site can be personalized based on your preferences or history. We may also use cookies to track information about which pages you visit within the Site to help us gauge the effectiveness of the Site or our content. We may also store other information such as recent searches in your session. We use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited us before or if you are a new visitor, and to help us understand what areas of the Site are of greatest interest to you. Cookies also may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences and password so you do not have to re-enter this information each time you visit the Site. 

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to stop accepting new cookies, to notify you when you a new cookie is received, and to disable existing cookies. If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, however, you may be unable to take full advantage of all the Site’s features. 

_Log Files_  
When you are using the Site, we automatically gather basic information from your browser, such as IP address, browser type, ISP, OS, and date/time stamps to analyze trends, administer the site, analyze bugs, and gather broad demographic information. We will not share log files externally. 

_Information About You_  
When you register with Catchafire, you may provide a variety of information to help us match you with the best possible volunteer or volunteer experience. We may display some of this information on our site publicly (such as name, location, and profile) and this information can be viewed by all registered users of the Site. We will not display any of your contact information, professional experience, skills, cause interests, or volunteer biography with the general public. However, this information may be shared either with volunteers or organizations looking for volunteers as this is the most reliable way to ensure that volunteers and organizations will be properly match. 

_Information From Other Web Sites_

**Disclosure of Your Information to Others**

_Opt-In Requirement_   
Without your affirmative consent, we will not sell, rent, or otherwise share your PII with other third parties, unless required as described under the Required Disclosures section below. In the case of posting a volunteer opportunity and accepting a volunteering match, we regard this as affirmative consent and will disclose your PII with the matched party. 

However, we may use third party suppliers and service providers to facilitate our services, and they may have access to your PII. For example, we may outsource one or more aspects of our Site to a supplier or service provider who performs services according to our requirements. Although we endeavor to select only reputable companies who share our commitment to privacy and will restrict how these suppliers or service providers may use or disclose the PII to which they have access, we are in no way responsible for such third parties or their activities. Therefore, you agree to allow us to give your information to third party suppliers and service providers in order for us to provide service to you.

Due to factors beyond our control, we cannot fully ensure that your information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access your information.

  2. comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process; or 
  3. protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Catchafire, its members, or others.
