**The Information We Collect**   
CatholicMatch.com is an online singles service designed to provide an easy way for our members to meet each other on the Web. To accomplish this, our members create their own unique profiles which are viewable by other members. In order to do this, we must ask for certain personal information. None of the information we gather can be used by the public (visitors, other members, or anyone not employed by Acolyte, LLC or the financial institutions used to process membership charges) to identify specific individuals.

We are a membership-based service. We collect credit card, address, or bank information only from those who choose to join. Paid members are permitted access to all functionality offered on the site, while members who join for free maybe only browse the site but not contact any other members. All visitors to our site may browse the site and view some articles or features our site has to offer without entering any personal information.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
