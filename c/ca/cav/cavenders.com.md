When you make an online purchase through the Site, we may ask you for additional information to complete the transaction.

Like many websites, Cavender's uses cookies and other tracking technologies to collect general, non-personally-identifiable information about Site visitors. A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer.

You can control many tracking tools, including cookies, from your browser. In particular, you may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to the Site.

Additionally, some Internet browsers have a 'do not track' feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are currently not set up to respond to such signals.
