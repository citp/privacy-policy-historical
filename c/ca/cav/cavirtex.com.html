<li>With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to your information to carry out work on our behalf. These service providers help with our business operations such as fraud prevention and technology services.</li>
<li>When we believe, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure of your information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of or enforce our user agreements or other policies and agreements.</li>
<li>In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of Payward’s assets, financing or acquisition or all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
<li>With your consent or at your direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>(3) If we are under a duty to disclose or share your information to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
<p><strong>Other than in connection with a merger, sale of Payward's assets, financing or acquisition, we will not sell or rent any of your information to third parties for their own marketing purposes.</strong></p>
