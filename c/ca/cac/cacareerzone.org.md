# Privacy Policy

### Introduction

California CareerZone is a technology partnership between California Career Resource Network (CalCRN) and Iradix, LLC. ("Iradix"). This Privacy Policy was created in order to disclose its use of consumer data collected about you. This Privacy Policy is effective as of February 25, 2010. Any questions regarding this policy should be directed by email to [privacy@iradix.com](mailto:privacy@iradix.com). You may also contact Iradix at P.O. Box 696, New York, New York, 10274. The following discloses Iradix's information gathering and dissemination practices for applications including those accessed through a third party website ("Applications"). If you follow a link that takes you outside of this website, you will be subject to the privacy policy and terms and conditions of the website you are visiting. 

### Information Collected and Received

Iradix may collect or receive information about each person who uses the Applications including, but not limited to, user name, password, first and last name, email address, street address, gender, occupation, interests, job history and other personal information. Iradix also collects information on the pages you access and other information you may volunteer. Iradix does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, do not use the Applications or send any information about yourself to Iradix,. No one under the age of 13 may provide any personal information to Iradix. If Iradix discovers that Iradix has collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, Iradix will delete that information as soon as possible. If any one believes that Iradix has any information from or about a child under 13, please contact Iradix immediately at [privacy@iradix.com](mailto:privacy@iradix.com). Minors 13 and older should ask their parents permission prior to sending any information about themselves through the Application. 

### Uses of Information

Except as described in this section, we will not disclose your personal information to any third party without notifying you of our intent to share the information and giving you an opportunity to prevent your information from being shared. Nothing herein will restrict us from sharing your information with CalCRN.

From time to time, we may partner with companies based on your interests. These partner companies will never see your email address or any other information that could identify you or be used to contact you directly. Any exceptions to this policy of sharing your name, address or email address with a partner company will be done only with your permission.

Iradix reserves the right to disclose information when required by law. We occasionally use other companies to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information. By contractual agreement, those companies must treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, we will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies.

The website registration form requires users to give Iradix contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information (such as your zip code, age, or income level). Iradix uses customer contact information to send the user information about Iradix and promotional material from some of Iradix's partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary. Iradix may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor the visitor's experience on this website, show the visitor content that Iradix thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. The demographic and profile data will be shared with advertisers ONLY on an aggregate basis.

If Iradix is going to use personally identifiable information collected through this website in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection Iradix will notify users via email and/or by posting a notice on this website for 30 days prior to such use. This Agreement may not be otherwise amended except in a writing that specifically refers to this Privacy Policy and is physically signed by both parties.
