**III. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AND HOW WE COLLECT SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION**

**1\. Identification (“ID”) Verification.** Casinos are required to verify the photo ID at the Casino entrances of all individuals who appear to be under 30, to ensure that no one under the legal gambling age of 19 is permitted entry. Security Officers posted at the entrance of the Casino may use identification verifiers to scan any ID including if they believe it may have been tampered with or altered.

Casinos are also required, under provincial and federal laws, to verify government-issued photo ID and to record certain information, including name, date of birth, address, type of ID, place of issuance of ID, and ID reference number, before conducting certain types of transactions. These transactions include but are not limited to foreign exchange transactions of Cdn.$3,000 or more, cash transactions of Cdn.$10,000 or more (see Large Cash Transaction Records), casino disbursement transactions of Cdn.$10,000 or more, credit extensions of any amount, and opening a front money account in any amount.

Caesars Windsor also requires government-issued photo ID before issuing or permitting use of a loyalty card for its Loyalty Program such as the Total Rewards Card to protect customers who may lose or misplace their cards.

**2\. Photography.** To protect your privacy, photography is prohibited on the gaming floor. The only exceptions to this prohibition are photographs of jackpot and tournament winners, who consent in writing to their picture being taken. Except for your spouse or significant other, no other customers will be included in the photographs. Caesars Windsor may also take photographs inside the casino for publicity purposes and advertising campaigns. In these cases, only actors are used in the photographs, and signage is posted to advise customers of the photography shoot. In some cases, entertainers will have their performances in the Entertainment Centre videotaped and photographed. When this is happening, we will notify you through signage and/or an announcement at the beginning of the performance.

**3\. Video Surveillance.** In order to comply with Regulations made pursuant to the Gaming Control Act, Caesars Windsor is required to have surveillance systems to monitor all gaming and sensitive areas of the Casino. Video surveillance cameras are used to protect Caesars Windsor, its customers and employees against potential violations of criminal and/or civil laws. Surveillance camera output is monitored by Caesars Windsor Surveillance personnel, authorized Caesars Windsor officers or directors, Ontario Provincial Police and regulatory authorities.

**4\. Self-Exclusion and Facial Recognition.** Self-exclusion is a voluntary program offered by Caesars Windsor and the OLG to individuals who choose to be included in the program because they have difficulty gaming responsibly. In addition to the information collected directly from individuals who have completed the Self-Exclusion Form as described below, the self-exclusion program also uses an automated facial recognition technology system to identify self-excluded individuals. This technology captures facial images of Casino customers at a distance and compares such images to the images of those who have voluntarily provided their photograph to the self-exclusion program. This technology only identifies possible matches with those registered with the self-exclusion program and does not identify or retain the images of other individuals. Access to the information gathered as part of the self-exclusion program, including facial recognition information, is limited to the individuals who require the information in order to operate the self-exclusion program. All information gathered as part of the self-exclusion program, including all facial recognition information, is protected by the appropriate technological systems including encryption algorithms.

The description of the self-exclusion program and facial recognition technology as set out in this Privacy Policy does not amend or supersede the terms and conditions that any individual agreed to when registering for the self-exclusion program and, specifically, does not provide any kind of representation or guarantee with respect to the effectiveness of the self-exclusion program.

**5\. Involuntary Exclusion.** To protect the safety or security of our customers and employees, and to comply with Caesars Windsor’s commitment to responsible gaming and a safe and secure gaming environment, you may be involuntarily excluded from Caesars Windsor (by Notice of Trespass or otherwise) if we believe that you have difficulty gaming responsibly, if you have been involved in a safety or security incident at Caesars Windsor, another Ontario Casino or another Casino owned, operated or managed by Caesars and its affiliates, or if you have otherwise demonstrated behaviour that we believe puts you, other customers or our employees at risk. We will collect and retain information relating to the circumstances leading to our determination that you should be excluded from the premises.

**6\. Manual and Electronic Forms.** During your visit to Caesars Windsor, you may be asked to provide information for various forms, requiring different types of Personal Information. The forms you may be asked to complete fall in the following categories:

(a) __Customer Tracking and Reward Programs.__ From time to time Caesars Windsor has established and may in future establish various player tracking and reward programs. For example, you may choose to become a member of our Loyalty Program so that you can redeem your slot points for cash back, reward credits for cash, or qualify for complimentaries, and many other promotional offers, and receive invitations to parties and events. If you choose to join the Loyalty Program and have your play rated, we may collect certain information about you including name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, interests, gaming history, number of visits to the Casino, and level of play. If you choose to join the Loyalty Program through one of our affiliates, including through a website or mobile application owned, controlled or operated by one of our affiliates, the affiliate may disclose this information to us and we may collect it from them. Caesars Windsor uses this information to better understand the interests of its customers, to provide you with valuable marketing information, and to assess your eligibility for cash back, reward credits for cash, complimentaries, and other promotional offers, and to invite you to parties and events.

(b) __Credit Applications.__ As a service to eligible customers, Caesars Windsor may extend you credit to facilitate gaming. To assess your eligibility for credit and determine a line of credit that corresponds with your financial means, we will first have to obtain information about you and verify your financial history.

As a result, any report sent by the Operator to FINTRAC will also be shared with OLG.

Two pieces of identification will be required from those individuals 19 to 21 years of age.

**XII. PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE ALCOHOL AND GAMING COMMISSION OF ONTARIO AND THE ONTARIO PROVINCIAL POLICE (OPP)**

The AGCO is an agency of the Government of Ontario. The AGCO is responsible for ensuring that gaming in this province is conducted with honesty and integrity. This involves overseeing the operation of Ontario’s gaming facilities. Officers of the OPP are seconded to the AGCO to carry out law enforcement activities within gaming facilities.

Regulations made pursuant to the Gaming Control Act require that gaming facility operators install video surveillance in certain parts of the facilities. OPP officers monitor the video surveillance in order to identify any illegal activity. In cases where illegal activity is suspected, OPP officers carry out an investigation. Some investigations may involve use of facial recognition information comparing a facial scan to a database of known or suspected criminals.

Patrons of gaming facilities do not automatically have their facial recognition information gathered by the OPP when they enter a gaming facility. Facial recognition information is gathered and used strictly in the course of police investigations. Access to information gathered by OPP officers is restricted to the officers who are assigned to work in the gaming facility. All information gathered is protected by sophisticated systems. Once an investigation is completed, the relevant face recognition information is removed from the OPP database. The collection of facial recognition information described in this section is separate from and in addition to the facial recognition information collected pursuant to the self-exclusion program described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.

The AGCO gathers Personal Information in accordance with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for the purpose of law enforcement. Anyone seeking access to the information must meet the requirements set out in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. If you have any questions or would like more information about the role of the AGCO or its use of face recognition, please contact:

Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario
