<p><strong>I. INTRODUCTION<br></strong>Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and all of our subsidiaries, affiliates, casinos and resorts (collectively, "Caesars Entertainment") have an unwavering commitment to providing outstanding products and services to visitors to our web sites. This Privacy Policy explains our practices for the following sites: Bally's Las Vegas, Paris Las Vegas, Flamingo Las Vegas, Caesars Palace, Las Vegas Hilton, Reno Hilton, Caesars Tahoe, Flamingo Laughlin, Bally's New Orleans, Grand Casino Gulfport, Grand Casino Biloxi, Grand Casino Tunica, Bally's Tunica, Sheraton Tunica, Caesars Indiana, Bally's Atlantic City, Caesars Atlantic City, Atlantic City Hilton, Claridge Casino Hotel, and Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (collectively, the "Sites").<br><br>Caesars Entertainment owns, manages or has an interest in 28 gaming properties operating under the Bally's, Caesars, Paris, Flamingo, Grand and Hilton brand names in the United States with a total of approximately 2 million square feet of gaming space, 29,000 hotel rooms and approximately 55,000 employees worldwide. Caesars Entertainment also manages other gaming properties outside the United States<br><br><strong>II. THIS PRIVACY POLICY IS LIMITED TO INFORMATION COLLECTED ON CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT SITES<br></strong>This Privacy Policy only applies to information Caesars Entertainment collects online through the Sites. Please note that, while reference may be made to information collected offline, this Privacy Policy is not a comprehensive statement of how information collected offline is obtained or used.<br><br>In addition, you hereby acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is incorporated in the Terms and Conditions of Use that controls your use and access of the Sites. A link to the Terms and Conditions can be found in the footer of any Caesars Entertainment's sites.<br><br><strong>III. WHY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT COLLECTS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION<br></strong>Caesars Entertainment collects information in a variety of different manners for multiple purposes, including: (1) to help us continually improve the services we offer, (2) to improve the utility of the Sites, and (3) to provide you and other interested visitors with information about promotions and other materials through e-mail and other communications that we believe will be beneficial to you. We will not share, sell or transfer personally identifiable information about you to third parties to use for their own marketing efforts except as outlined below or with your approval.<br><br><strong>IV. HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT<br><br>A. NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION<br></strong>On a regular basis, the Sites collect information about you that is not personally identifiable. Some examples of such information may include the type of browser you are using, what sites you came from, what pages of the Sites you visit, how much time is spent on those pages, and the pages from which you exit the Sites. In addition, Caesars Entertainment collects some non-personally identifiable information in the manners described below:<br><br><strong>1. COOKIES<br></strong>In general, when you visit the Sites, you remain anonymous unless you choose to provide information to us. The Sites do use "cookies," i.e., very small text files sent to your computer, which temporarily reside in your computer's hard drive. These cookies enable Caesars Entertainment to help your computer navigate through the Sites more quickly and allow us to better understand how visitors use the Sites. <strong>Caesars Entertainment does not use cookies to track what you do when you are not on the Sites or to collect personally identifiable information about you. These cookies do not damage or corrupt your computer or computer files.<br><br></strong>If you do not wish to receive the benefits of these cookies, you may set your browser to reject them. You should consult the instructions of your particular browser on how to do this. However, please be aware that rejecting the cookies could affect your ability to perform certain transactions on the Sites.<br><br><strong>2. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING<br></strong>Caesars Entertainment uses a third-party advertising company, Avenue A, to serve ads about Caesars Entertainment to other sites on the Internet; these ads contain links to a Site. Avenue A employs technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of such ads and that allows it to identify visitors to the Sites who viewed a particular ad on another site. This is primarily accomplished through the use of a technology device, commonly referred to as an action tag, which Avenue A places on the Sites as well as the other sites where it places ads to collect anonymous information. Avenue A may use information about your visits to our Sites and other sites on the Internet in order to personalize the advertisements you may see on other sites to offer you goods and services that Avenue A believes may be of interest to you. Unless otherwise notified, Avenue A does not use names, addresses, e-mail addresses or telephone numbers to identify visitors, and does not link online actions to an identifiable person.<br><br>Of course, while Avenue A provides some of this non-identifiable information to Caesars Entertainment, Caesars Entertainment does not control how Avenue A collects or uses this information. Our explanation here is based on the information provided to us by Avenue A. If you would like more information about this practice as well as your choices about not having this information collected or used by Avenue A and/or its customers, <a href="http://www.avenueainc.com/privacy/" target="_blank">click here</a>. <br><br><strong>3. E-MAIL DISCLOSURE<br></strong>Your personal information may be shared with reputable third parties but only for use in campaign delivery or to provide more relevant advertising. Your personal information may be combined with additional information provided by you at registration or augmented from other data sources in order to provide more relevant campaigns to you. We will never rent your personal information without your consent.<br><br><em>Caesars Entertainment uses a third-party e-mail service provider, Zustek, to deploy e-mail offers/correspondence from the "Sites"; these e-mails contain links to a Site. The personal information you have provided us will be used to help make our future marketing efforts more efficient. It may also be used by our marketing partners to bring you offers of interest. If at any time you wish to discontinue receiving any e-mail sent by our marketing partners, or us, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the e-mail. The e-mail offers and e-mail newsletters, as well as any campaigns contained in those e-mails sent to you by this site or our marketing partners, are provided through Zustek's E-mail Service.</em> <br><br><strong>B. PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION<br>Caesars Entertainment does not collect personal information from visitors to the Sites in any non-obvious manner.</strong> In order to provide you with more effective and personalized service, Caesars Entertainment does, however, collect personal information such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, credit card information, and other information in a variety of manners, as described below:<br><br><strong>1. RESERVATION PROCESS<br></strong>Visitors to the Sites have the ability to search for rates and availability at any of our hotels and resorts in the United States without ever providing any personal information. However, once you have decided on an available reservation, you will be asked to provide personal information. This will include your name, address, and other contact information, as well a credit card number, billing address, and the card's expiration date. The credit card number will be used solely to secure your reservation as detailed in the reservation process. Caesars Entertainment will create a private account for you based on the information you have provided as part of the reservation process; this account will enable you to access and/or modify your travel plans online and is designed to make your experience with the Sites both more personal and efficient. [To link to your Personal Profile - Guest Services Page, you must log into the E-mail Offers sign in on any Caesars Entertainment site.] Caesars Entertainment will also combine this information with any other data we have collected about you using our offline resources. Unless you indicate at this time that Caesars Entertainment may only use this information for limited purposes, Caesars Entertainment will use it for future reference when, e.g., we provide you with offers for future stays at one of our hotels or resorts or other information we believe may be of interest to you. Click here for more detailed information about how Caesars Entertainment uses this information.<br><br>Caesars Entertainment takes reasonable steps to ensure that the Reservations page on each Site is secure. For more information about our secure certificates, please click on the gold "Verisign" seal located on each Reservations page. For more information about our current security methods, please see the Security section below.<br><br>Your credit card number will be verified using a checking sequence; we may authorize payment(s) at this time that is consistent with payment process for each site. Once your reservation is confirmed, the Caesars Entertainment resort you have chosen will receive all the information you have submitted. The transfer of information takes place in the same fashion as if you called directly or made your reservation through a travel agent. Shortly after, you will receive an e-mail confirmation. That information is then used to create a user log in for you on our Site database.<br><br><strong>Caesars Entertainment will never share any of your personally identifiable data with any party not affiliated with Caesars Entertainment without your express written consent, except as provided below.</strong> [See Special Promotions and Contests; Special Circumstances; and How Caesars Entertainment Uses Personal Information]<br><br><strong>2. CONNECTION CARD PROGRAM<br></strong>Every visitor is invited to sign up for the Connection Card Program, which is your link to cash back, complimentary meals and other exciting special offers for Caesars Entertainment's properties throughout the United States. In order to sign up for this service, you will be asked to provide personal information including your name, address, and other contact information. This may only be available in certain regions/properties owned by Caesars Entertainment, Inc. <strong>Caesars Entertainment will also combine this information with any other data we have collected about you using our offline resources.</strong> Unless you indicate at this time that Caesars Entertainment may only use this information for limited purposes, Caesars Entertainment will use it for future reference when, e.g., we provide you with offers for future stays at one of our hotels or resorts or other information we believe may be of interest to you.<br><br><strong>Caesars Entertainment will never share any of your personally identifiable data with any party not affiliated with Caesars Entertainment without your express written consent, except as provided below. </strong>[See Special Promotions and Contests; Special Circumstances; and How Caesars Entertainment Uses Personal Information] <br><br><strong>3. PERSONAL PROFILE - GUEST SERVICES PAGE<br></strong>Caesars Entertainment will create a private account for you based on the information you have provided as part of the reservation or purchase process or when you sign up for a Connection Card; this account will enable you to access and/or modify your travel plans online and is designed to make your experience with the Sites both more personal and efficient. Alternatively, you may also create this profile without making a reservation or purchase by simply signing up for E-mail Offers through the Sites, which will create a guest services account. In order to sign up for this service, you will be requested to provide information such as your name, address, other contact information, and whether you wish to receive future e-mail communications from Caesars Entertainment.<br><br><strong>Caesars Entertainment will also combine this information with any other data we have collected about you using our offline resources.</strong> Unless you indicate at this time that Caesars Entertainment may only use this information for limited purposes, Caesars Entertainment will use it for future reference when, e.g., we provide you with offers for future stays at one of our hotels or resorts or other information we believe may be of interest to you.<br><br><strong>Caesars Entertainment will never share any of your personally identifiable data with any party not affiliated with Caesars Entertainment without your express written consent, except as provided below.</strong> [See Special Promotions and Contests; Special Circumstances; and How Caesars Entertainment Uses Personal Information] Please note that you will have the ability to review and update any of the information you provide for your profile at any time, by logging into the e-mail offers sign in on any Caesars Entertainment site.<br><br><strong>4. SPECIAL PROMOTIONS AND CONTESTS<br></strong>Occasionally, Caesars Entertainment requests visitors of the Sites to provide their e-mail address in order to provide them with information about, for example, promotions and special offers, or to participate in a contest or sweepstakes. Caesars Entertainment will also combine this information with any other data we have collected about you using our offline resources. Unless you indicate at this time that Caesars Entertainment may only use this information for limited purposes, Caesars Entertainment will use it for future reference when, e.g., we provide you with offers for future stays at one of our hotels or resorts or other information we believe may be of interest to you. Unless you indicate at the time that you provide this information that it may only be used for limited purposes, Caesars Entertainment will place this information into its database that may contain information we have collected about you via the Sites as well as offline and use it for future reference when, e.g., we provide you with offers for future stays at one of our hotels or resorts or other information we believe may be of interest to you.<br><br><strong>Caesars Entertainment will never share any of your personally identifiable data with any party not affiliated with Caesars Entertainment without your express written consent, except as provided below.</strong> [See Special Promotions and Contests; Special Circumstances; and How Caesars Entertainment Uses Personal Information]<br><br><strong>5. PURCHASE INFORMATION<br></strong>When you purchase an item through our Sites such as at our online store, we will ask for your name, the type of credit card you intend to use, your credit card number, your billing address for the card, and the card's expiration date. This information is necessary in order for us to bill you for your purchase. If your billing address differs from your shipping address, or if you intend to send your purchase to a third party, we will ask you for additional name and address information in order to fulfill your request. As described above, Caesars Entertainment will create a private account for you based on the information you have provided; this account is designed to make your future visits to the Sites even more personal and efficient.<br><br><strong>Caesars Entertainment will also combine this information with any other data we have collected about you using our offline resources.</strong> Unless you indicate at this time that Caesars Entertainment may only use this information for limited purposes, Caesars Entertainment will use it for future reference when, e.g., we provide you with offers for future stays at one of our hotels or resorts or other information we believe may be of interest to you.<br><br><strong>Caesars Entertainment will never share any of your personally identifiable data with any party not affiliated with Caesars Entertainment without your express written consent, except as provided below.</strong> [See Special Promotions and Contests; Special Circumstances; and How Caesars Entertainment Uses Personal Information]<br><br><strong>6. OTHER ONLINE SOURCES<br></strong>Caesars Entertainment may also collect personally identifiable information about you from other online sources including, without limitation, e-mail inquiries sent by you to Caesars Entertainment, your response to special offers and promotions periodically offered through the Sites, and information you provide through other special features appearing on the Sites currently or in the future. Caesars Entertainment will use the information you provide to process your request and/or research your query. In addition, Caesars Entertainment may also use the information you provide in the manners described herein.<br><br><strong>Caesars Entertainment will also combine this information with any other data we have collected about you using our offline resources.</strong> Unless you indicate at this time that Caesars Entertainment may only use this information for limited purposes, Caesars Entertainment will use it for future reference when, e.g., we provide you with offers for future stays at one of our hotels or resorts or other information we believe may be of interest to you.<br><br><strong>Caesars Entertainment will never share any of your personally identifiable data with any party not affiliated with Caesars Entertainment without your express written consent, except as provided below.</strong> [See Special Promotions and Contests; Special Circumstances; and How Caesars Entertainment Uses Personal Information]<br><br><strong>V. HOW CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT USES PERSONAL INFORMATION<br><br>A. CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT SHARES THIS INFORMATION WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES<br></strong>Unless you have specifically limited how Caesars Entertainment may use your personally identifiable information, Caesars Entertainment will place that information into its database that may contain information we have collected about you via the Sites as well as offline and use it to send you future e-mails and correspondence about promotions, special events and/or other items we believe may be of interest to you. The information in this database is available to designated persons at Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries and affiliates including those that operate any of the Caesars Entertainment hotel and resorts.<br><br><strong>Caesars Entertainment treats the information you provide as confidential information and takes reasonable measures to ensure that it is only available to designated personnel for use in connection with Caesars Entertainment's business.</strong> Caesars Entertainment may use third parties to assist it with fulfilling your requests, completing your reservation, forwarding you material, or similar functions. These third parties are under a contractual obligation to not use this information except for these limited purposes. Except for these exceptions, or in the event that Caesars Entertainment sells an entire line of business relating to a particular web site, or in the event of a "special circumstance," [See Sale of Assets and Special Circumstances] Caesars Entertainment will not sell, share or transfer your personal information to any entity outside of the Caesars Entertainment family of companies.<br><br><strong>B. CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT MAY COMBINE ONLINE INFORMATION WITH OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT VISITORS TO ITS SITES<br></strong>In addition to the above, Caesars Entertainment will combine the personal information it collects online with information it collects through offline methods, including but not limited to surveys, guest comments, and market research. You may opt out of receiving e-mail correspondence by logging into the E-mail Offers sign in on any Caesars Entertainment site. <br><br><strong>C. OPT-OUT CHOICES<br></strong>Caesars Entertainment provides you with the ability to control how we use your personally identifiable information. Since Caesars Entertainment does not sell or rent its customers' data to third parties, you need not opt-out in order to avoid receiving e-mails that do not relate to Caesars Entertainment's properties and services. If you do not wish to receive this information, you may elect to limit our use of your information in one of two ways. First, you may elect not to receive communications from Caesars Entertainment about offers or promotions we think may be of interest to you. Second, you may elect not to allow us to combine information collected about you online with our offline database. You may exercise your opt-out options at any time by logging into your guest services account through the E-mail Offers sign in on any Caesars Entertainment site. Please allow up to six weeks for your new preferences to take effect. Caesars Entertainment reserves the right to limit participation in certain sweepstakes, contests, or other promotions to visitors who do not elect to use their opt-out rights. <br><br><strong>VI. ACCESSING YOUR GUEST SERVICES PROFILE<br></strong>As noted above, you always have the ability to review and update your personal profile, including the personally identifiable information you provide as well as opt-out from receiving e-mail correspondence from Caesars Entertainment properties. Simply log in to your Guest Services account through the E-mail Offers sign in on any Caesars Entertainment site, click the "Update Profile" link, and make the modifications you desire. <br><br><strong>VII. SECURITY<br></strong>Caesars Entertainment regularly reviews the security of the Sites. Although the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to and from Caesars Entertainment via the Internet or e-mail cannot be absolutely guaranteed, Caesars Entertainment endeavors to create secure and reliable Sites for its visitors. Caesars Entertainment has invested, and will continue to invest, in high quality security in terms of access to information, data quality, and physical security of servers where information is stored. Caesars Entertainment implements a variety of security measures, including encryption and other measures against hacking or unauthorized access to protect confidential information such as credit card numbers, names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and any other personal information you may provide during your visit to the Sites from loss, misuse, interception and hacking. In addition, the information you provide is available only to qualified, designated persons at Caesars Entertainment, including those that operate any of the Caesars Entertainment hotel and resorts, who are under an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.<br><br>Nevertheless, when disclosing any personal information, you should remain mindful that, as with all e-mail sent via the Internet, your information may be intercepted without our consent by unscrupulous members of the public and, consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent. In addition, third party web sites that are accessed through links on the Sites have separate privacy policies and security measures, and Caesars Entertainment is not responsible or liable for the practices, policies or security measures implemented on these third party web sites.<br><br><strong>You hereby acknowledge that Caesars Entertainment is not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner</strong>.<br><br><strong>VIII. LINKS<br></strong>As noted above, the Sites may contain links to other web sites. Caesars Entertainment is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites, and you are encouraged to view the privacy policies of these other sites as soon as you enter them.<br><br><strong>IX. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES<br></strong>Caesars Entertainment reserves the right to disclose the personal information of the users of the Sites for any law enforcement purpose at the request of any law enforcement body or in response to a subpoena or as otherwise required by any court or administrative agency. We may also share such information at our discretion if it appears that your actions on the Sites are in violation of the Terms and Conditions of Use, and that disclosure of this information will assist in efforts to enforce the Terms and Conditions of Use or will assist Caesars Entertainment in connection with any legal proceeding between you and Caesars Entertainment. A link to the Terms and Conditions can be found in the footer of any Caesars Entertainment's sites. Caesars Entertainment may also provide email addresses to third parties for suppression purposes. Suppression ensures that consumers who have unsubscribed or requested that they not receive e-mail from Caesars Entertainment also will not receive a Caesars Entertainment exclusive email via a 3rd party's email marketing. <br><br><strong>X. SALE OF ASSETS<br></strong>Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Caesars Entertainment to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets (including the Sites) to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever. Caesars Entertainment specifically reserves the right to transfer personally identifiable information collected from its Sites to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information. You will be given the ability to opt out of continued use of your e-mail by any buyer of the site.<br><br><strong>XI. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY<br></strong>Caesars Entertainment may change the features and/or content found on the Sites. Consequently, this Privacy Policy may change to reflect any new features and/or content. You should periodically revisit our Privacy Policy to be sure that you are familiar with our current policy. Your use and/or continued use of the Sites (following any modifications to this Privacy Policy) will be conclusively deemed acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy and any changes thereto.<br><br><strong>XII. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA FROM CHILDREN<br></strong>Caesars Entertainment does not knowingly or intentionally collect any personally identifiable information from, or market to individuals under the age of 21. If you know of a child who has provided us with personally identifiable information, please contact us immediately so that we may identify the information that needs to be removed from our database. No information collected through the Sites from users self-identified as children will knowingly be used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside Caesars Entertainment.<br><br><strong>XIII. COMPLAINTS AND CONTACTING CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT ABOUT THE SITES<br></strong>If you believe that Caesars Entertainment has not adhered to this policy, please send the details to:<br><br>Attention: LEGAL Caesars Entertainment, Inc.<br>3930 Howard Hughes Parkway<br>Las Vegas, NV 89109<br>E-mail: <a href="mailto:Legal@caesars.com">Legal@caesars.com</a><br><br>Caesars Entertainment will investigate all such incidents and provide you with a written response via e-mail once the investigation is complete.
