This will give us a complete view of the time you spend on our platform, and which parts of the website you find particularly appealing. We will collect your IP address, but THIS DOES NOT IDENTIFY YOU PERSONALLY; it strictly refers to the traffic coming from your computer to our platform, not to the person generating the traffic.
