We may collect through the Services both personal information that identifies you and can be used to contact you, and non-personal information, which is data in a form that does not allow direct association with you, which may include technical information, including the IP address through which you are accessing the Services and the unique mobile device ID or virtual unique device identifier for any mobile device you may be using.

We collect and store the personal information you provide us when purchasing, registering, or using the CMV Apps, when you inquire about CMV Tournaments, products and services, and when you sign up for our events (including via Tournament Servicers), promotions, and mailing lists.

    2. #### Data We Collect Automatically

CMV automatically collects and stores certain technical, app-related, and customer purchase information. Most of this information is non-personal, which means that this information by itself cannot be used to identify you; but this data may be used to identify you when combined with other information. This information includes:

      * Data about your account, tournament registrations, and purchase history;
      * Your internet location and mobile device identifiers (such as mobile device type, IP Address, unique mobile device ID or other device identifiers, Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, telephone number of mobile device, and country of registration);
      * Additional information about your device, such as device name, operating system, browser type and language;
      * Platform data, including purchase history and other information related to the Google Play Store or iOS App Store; and
      * Location data (based on your IP address and telecommunications provider).
    3. #### Data We Collect From our Partners

      * Data from a third-party tool or SNS, if you link it with the Service (e.g., Facebook or Google);
      * Data from third-party Tournament Servicer tools, to the extent you provide the information (e.g., via the Smash.gg website or app);
      * Data we use to investigate and prevent fraud such as click-fraud or fraudulent refunds or rebates; and
      * Data related to analytics and advertising, in order to provide you with access to better apps and Services.
  2. ### HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

Generally, we use your information to provide you with an efficient and customized experience. For example, we may use information in the following ways to provide you the Services:

    * To send important notices, such as communications about your purchases and changes to our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy;
    * To send “push” notifications to your mobile device regarding CMV Apps that you have been using (for example, suggesting that you open the CMV Apps to take certain actions);

    * To identify and suggest connections with other CMV users or users of an SNS that you use in connection with a CMV App;
    * To enable communications between you and other CMV users or users of an SNS that you use in connection with a CMV App;
    * To allow us to enable you to reset your password if you have forgotten it;
    * To provide technical support and respond to inquiries from you;
    * To prevent fraud and potentially illegal activities and enforce our Terms of Service;
    * To monitor the performance of our third-party vendors and distributors; and
    * To help us to develop, deliver and improve the Services.

_For users in the EEA, the legal basis for processing of the above personal information is to provide you with the Services you have requested and to prevent fraud or injury to the Services and our other customers._

Additionally, we may use your information to promote additional CMV Tournaments, events, products or services, including:

    * To inform you about new CMV Tournaments, CMV-licensed video game tournaments or other events and to promote CMV Tournaments, CMV-licensed video game tournaments or other events;
    * To contact you regarding CMV Tournaments, events, sweepstakes, or campaigns you may participate in, and provide you with the requirements to join the foregoing, as well to provide you with benefits and prizes from CMV;

    * To deliver and target advertising from third parties;
    * To gather demographic information about CMV users in order to more effectively manage the Services and provide targeted advertising; and
    * To track clicks or other ad fulfillment metrics.

_The EEA legal basis for this processing of your personal information is our pursuit of legitimate interests, specifically in this case the legitimate interest to optimize your experience with the Services by avoiding display of recommendations and offers that are irrelevant to you. If you or the relevant Data Controller are located in the EEA, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to such processing. To exercise this right, you may do so by contacting us as provided in the “Contact” link below._

If we send e-mail or SMS messages to you for the purpose of promoting CMV events, products or services, or those of a third-party partner, we will generally provide you with choices about receiving further such promotional messages. Preferences for “push” notifications may in most cases be adjusted through the applicable CMV App or your mobile device.

  3. ### HOW WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION AND HOW LONG WE KEEP IT

    1. #### Interaction with SNS’s

By registering with your SNS login information, you allow CMV to access certain information from your profile for that SNS. The information you allow CMV to access is affected by the privacy settings you and your friends establish at the SNS. You can control and find out more about these settings directly from the SNS. For example, CMV may access and store some or all of the following information, as allowed by you, the SNS and your preferences:

In addition, if you are a member of an SNS, CMV Apps may also enable you to log in through an interface provided by that SNS.

If you log in to a CMV App using an SNS, or access an SNS through a CMV App, we may receive the personal and non-personal information that you have provided (or provide in the future) to that SNS. 

By connecting any CMV App to an SNS, you consent to CMV’s access, use and storage in accordance with this Privacy Policy of any and all of the information that you agreed the SNS could provide to CMV. Furthermore, by logging into any CMV App or Service through an SNS such as Facebook, you permit the SNS to check your SNS account cookies when you are visiting our website and to receive information concerning the actions you take on the website.

You may be able to specify what information is provided by the SNS to CMV using the privacy settings in your SNS profile information.

    2. #### CMV Tournaments

      * Your email address.

    4. #### Under Special Circumstances

We may disclose information about you to law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of CMV or a third party, to protect the safety of any person or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be illegal or unethical.

CMV Apps are not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. CMV may use an age screen in certain countries in which users are required to enter their’ ages. When a CMV App collects age information via an age screen prior to download and users identify themselves as under 13, the CMV App will block such users from providing personal information, will disable the collection of personal information from such users until they reach the age of 13, will not send any cookies to such users and will instruct third parties not to send cookies to such users. We will not collect more information from children under the age of 13 than is reasonably necessary to provide our Services. In one or more countries outside the United States, the applicable age may be older than 13.

We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online.
