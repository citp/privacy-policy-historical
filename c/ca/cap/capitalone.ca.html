<p><b>PRIVACY COMMITMENT:</b> <i>At Capital One, we are committed to providing our customers with financial products and services to meet your needs. That commitment includes protecting personal information we obtain about you. We want to earn your trust by providing strict safeguards to protect information about you as we continue to bring you valuable products and services.</i> </p>
 
<p><b>Confidentiality and security</b><br>
We maintain up-to-date physical safeguards (like secure areas in buildings), electronic safeguards (like encryption), and procedural safeguards (like customer authentication procedures to prevent identity theft). We restrict access to personal information about you to those employees who need to have that information to provide products or services to you. We train our employees on their roles in protecting this personal information, and we require them to do their parts in protecting personal information about you. We also conduct regular internal audits of the safeguards to support our commitment. Sometimes we use other companies to provide services for us such as marketing, advertising, and credit card embossing. We select these companies carefully, and we require them to keep the information we share with them safe and secure. We do not allow them to use or share the information for any purpose other than the job they are hired to do.</p>

<p><b>Information we collect</b><br>
<i>Consumers.</i> We may collect information about consumers who are not our current customers. Sometimes this information comes from credit reporting agencies; we ask about a consumer's credit status so that we can determine the consumer's eligibility for credit or employment with us. Sometimes this information comes from membership lists and other lists of potential customers such as magazine subscription lists, so we can offer our products and services to consumers. When a consumer applies to be our customer, either in writing, by phone, by e-mail, or at our Web site, we collect the information reported during the application process on applications, questionnaires, or other forms (such as the consumer's name, address, and e-mail address).</p>

<p><i>Customers.</i> When you are a customer, we collect and retain information to help us monitor the performance and effectiveness of our products and services, to audit your usage of the products and services, and to better tailor our service to your needs and interests. We collect information about you when we provide products or services to you, including information about your transactions with us and with other companies in the Capital One family, and your transactions with others. This information could include account balances, fees, payment history, parties to transactions, and credit card usage. We may collect information from credit reporting agencies, and other outside sources to verify financial information about you, such as your employment, credit score, and credit history.</p>  

<p><i>Web site visits.</i> When you visit our Web site, we may collect information about your use of our products and services, which is captured in a common log file format, including your Internet Protocol ("IP") address and operating system, the date and time of your visit, and information about the pages you visit while on our Web site. To assist us in collecting information when you visit us online, we may use electronic technologies such as cookies, which are small electronic files written to your computer's hard drive, which help us understand what parts of our products and services you find most useful. You can reject cookies, but sometimes this compromises the functionality of the product or service. </p>

<p><b>Use of information</b><br>
At Capital One, we appreciate how important privacy is to our customers. We want you to understand why we collect and use information about you and how this can benefit you. Simply stated, by knowing more about our customers, we and our business partners can provide specialized products that may be of interest to you and your family. We collect and use information about consumers and customers so we or our service vendors (on our behalf) can use it in the following ways: (i) open, maintain, service, process, analyze, audit, and make collections on your account; (ii) verify your creditworthiness; (iii) protect you from identity theft, fraud, and unauthorized access to your account; and (iv) identify your preferences and establish your eligibility for special offers and discounts. We may also use your information to respond to your questions or to occasionally contact you in order to notify you of functional changes to our Web site or to our products and services. If you choose to contact us, we may retain your e-mail address, the content of your communication and our response.</p> 

<p><b>Disclosure to third parties</b><br>
<i>Service vendors and credit reporting agencies.</i> We may share customer information with our service vendors and credit reporting agencies for the purposes described above in the paragraph "Use of information."</p>

<p><i>Other third parties.</i> We may share with carefully selected business partners information we collect about our customers, former customers, and withdrawn or declined applicants, such as name, street address, e-mail address, and telephone number, for the purpose of determining the eligibility of customers and consumers for valuable products and services offered by us or our business partners. We may share customer information with other parties who have financial or business dealings with you. If you give us your Social Insurance Number, we may use it to identify you with credit reporting agencies and other parties, and we may keep it along with other information about you in our records, even after your account is closed, to use for the purposes stated above.</p> 

<p><b>Your consent</b><br>
<i>Once a customer.</i> By becoming a customer of ours, or by communicating or providing information to us in any other way, you acknowledge that we collect personal information about you in the manner described in this Privacy Statement, and you provide your consent for us to collect, retain, use, and disclose your personal information for the purposes specified in this Canada Privacy Statement. However, you may withdraw your consent for us to share information with carefully selected business partners as described in the subparagraph above "Other third parties," at any time by contacting us as described below in the paragraph "Contact us."</p>

<p><i>Other purposes.</i> If at some point later on we want to use your personal information for any purpose other than the ones specified in this Canada Privacy Statement, we will inform you of such purpose before using the information for this new purpose. We may inform you by posting a notice to our Web site or by communicating with you directly. Such notice may presume that you consent to the use of your information for the new purpose unless you indicate your wish to opt-out of such use by us by informing us that you do not wish us to use your personal information for the new purpose.</p>

<p><b>Information quality</b><br>
We maintain procedures to assure that the personal information we collect is accurate, up-to-date, and as complete as possible. If you believe that the information we have about you is not as accurate or complete as it could be, please contact us, as described below, so we can supplement or amend this information.</p>

<p><b>Access to personal information about you</b><br>
You may ask us about the personal information we collect about you, and you may request access to such information. We will endeavour to answer your inquiry and/or provide you with access to this information, subject to certain considerations specified by law. Please contact us as described below.</p>
