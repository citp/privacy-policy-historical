# Capcom: Privacy Policy

## Capcom's Privacy Policy

Capcom is very concerned about the protection of privacy for all Capcom customers and Web site visitors. Capcom respects your privacy and your choice not to have your personally identifiable information shared with other people.

Capcom collects personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and the like, only when voluntarily submitted through Capcom's registration process by a customer or a Web site visitor. All information gathered in the registration process will be used only by Capcom, Inc. to improve Capcom's products, services and Web site and to inform you of Capcom's new products, new releases and promotional programs. Capcom will not share any personally identifiable information you provide with any other company without permission. By signing up to receive a free subscription to GamePro Magazine under our Fighters Edge Program, you permit Capcom to share your information on your sign-up card with GamePro Magazine. Capcom may in the future request information from you that may be shared with others. In these situations, you will be told of this fact, and given an opportunity to say no. 

If you are 18 years or older, you may have the ability to e-mail other users or post messages on portions of the Capcom Web site. In the event that you do post messages on this site, remember that other users of this site will have access to your e-mail address and user name. 

To protect the information you've given to Capcom, we use commercially reasonable measures to prevent others from accessing your information. Once you register with Capcom, we will send you a notice, via postal or e-mail, confirming the accuracy of the information we have for your registration. If you find any information inaccurate, you may correct information by sending us the correction via postal mail or e-mail and we will implement such correction. If at any time you want to update your contact information or you do not want to receive new product information from us, let us know by contacting us at [megamail@capcom.com](mailto:megamail@capcom.com). _Please be sure to include in your message the name of the site at which you registered and the e-mail address you used to register so that we can verify your request._

Capcom may use "cookies" to enhance your experience at our Web site. Cookies are pieces of information that we may place on your computer to help "personalize" your visit to the site. For example, a cookie will allow us to remember certain things about you, such as your screen name or where you left off in a game. The cookie only tells us that you have visited the site and may contain certain information that will help us make your visit more enjoyable but does not give us your personally identifiable information. 

Capcom's Web sites may contain links to other sites for your convenience. Because Capcom does not operate these other sites, we cannot guarantee that they will observe the same privacy policy. 

We encourage parents to monitor their children's online use, and to help us protect their privacy by instructing them to never provide personally identifiable information, such as names and addresses, on this site or any other site without permission. If you are a parent or guardian and are interested in knowing more about Capcom's policy regarding the online collection of information from children, we recommend reviewing the Children Privacy Policy below.
