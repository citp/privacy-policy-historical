# Privacy Policy – Capgemini Worldwide

## Introduction

Data protection is a key concern for Capgemini which has been placing this matter as a priority for long. Hence, transparency regarding the way we process the personal data we collect is a commitment for us. The information provided below intends to provide you all relevant information in relation to the collection and processing of information which may be collected through this website [www.capgemini.com](http://www.capgemini.com/), (hereinafter, “the website”)

Capgemini Services SAS (hereinafter, “we”, “us”, “our” or “Capgemini”) may collect and process personal data relating to you when you visit this website.

## Sharing of your Personal Data

#### **1\. With other entities of the group**

** ** Capgemini is a global organisation. Whilst we have distinct legal entities (e.g., country subsidiaries) in many parts of the world, our internal processes and infrastructure are international in scope and nature and generally cross-country borders. Accordingly, you should be aware that we may share your personal data with other entities of Capgemini and transfer it to countries in the world where we have data centres or otherwise do business, including those located outside the European Union (EU). Such data transfers will be covered by our Binding Corporate Rules (Capgemini BCR) which were approved by European Data Protection Authorities in 2016. As a result of Capgemini BCR wherever your personal data are processed in the Capgemini group, your personal data will benefit from the same level of protection. You can access Capgemini BCR by clicking [here](https://www.capgemini.com/resources/capgemini-binding-corporate-rules/).

**2\. Third-party suppliers**

We also rely on third-party suppliers and partners with which we may share your personal data for the purposes indicated above except for marketing purposes. Whenever we rely on such third parties, we make sure that they provide an adequate level of protection to the personal data they process on our behalf and when such third parties are located out of the European Union, we make sure that we enter into European Model Clauses as adopted by the European Commission. You can obtain a copy of the said EU Model Clauses by contacting us at [dpocapgemini.global@capgemini.com](mailto:dpocapgemini.global@capgemini.com).

**3\. Judicial, public and/or governmental authorities**

** ** We may also be required – by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence— to disclose your personal data.  We may also disclose your personal data if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.

We may also disclose personal information if we determine in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our rights and pursue available remedies, enforce our terms and conditions, investigate fraud, or protect our operations or users.

## **Business Reorganisations**

Like many organisations, Capgemini may reorganise its business operations around the world from time to time, whether by buying new businesses or selling or merging existing businesses. This may involve us disclosing personal data to prospective or actual purchasers of parts of our business, or receiving personal data from potential sellers. It is our practice to seek appropriate confidentiality protection for personal data disclosed in these types of transactions.

## **Your rights**

In any case, you have the right to access your personal data.

You can also request that your personal data be rectified or deleted. You are entitled as well to object to the processing of your personal data or to request restriction thereof. In addition, you have the right to ask for receiving your personal data in a structured and standard format.

## **Data security and integrity**

** ** Capgemini uses various technological and procedural security measures in order to protect the personal data we collect, use or transfer from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction.
