# Privacy Policy | Capgemini Worldwide

Capgemini believes that the establishment of trust and privacy is instrumental to the continued growth of the Internet.  We also believe that the efficient collection, use and transfer of information serve to enhance the development of the Internet and electronic commerce, provided that such information is handled in a fair and responsible manner.

##  Introduction

In order to inform you of its policies and activities with respect to the collection, use and transfer of Personal Data on its websites, Capgemini is providing you with an electronic copy of this Privacy Policy (the “ **Policy** ”). This Policy applies to all websites that are owned and operated by Cap Gemini S.A. and/or companies that Cap Gemini S.A. controls, directly or indirectly (collectively, “ **Capgemini** ”), unless a particular website displays its own privacy policy. 

  Cap Gemini S.A. or one of companies that Cap Gemini S.A. controls, directly or indirectly, is the data controller with respect to Personal Data collected and processed via its respective website. When required by local law, the relevant Capgemini entity performs the formalities with the local data protection authorities with respect to the processing of Personal Data.

In this Policy, “Personal Data” means information which relates to an individual and which identifies that individual, either directly or indirectly (together with other information that is reasonably likely to come into Capgemini’s possession), such as your name, email address or telephone number.

##  Collection of Personal Data

Generally, you can visit Capgemini websites without providing any Personal Data about yourself. However, in order to access some parts of our websites, such as to download certain documents, or in connection with another specific purpose, we may need to collect Personal Data from you.  Providing Personal Data to us in these events is voluntary.  If you do not provide Personal Data to us, then you will not be able to benefit from the respective functionality offered by our websites, such as communication, downloading of documents or recruitment. The purposes, for which your Personal Data is collected, are described below, along with a brief description of how your Personal Data may be handled in each case.

  * **Communicating with you.** We will follow up on comments and other requests that you submit to us through our website, such as online queries, business related inquiries, or registering your attendance at a conference. This may include using your Personal Data to call you back by telephone or communicating with you via email.
  * **Direct marketing and promotion.** Direct marketing and/or promotional efforts by or on behalf of Capgemini may include providing you with specific information that you have requested online, providing more general information about other Capgemini offerings, or enabling you to participate to online contests or to register for any sponsored events. When we collect Personal Data for direct marketing or promotional purposes, however, we generally offer appropriate choices regarding the use of your Personal Data.
  * **Recruitment**. If you submit a resume or job application online, we will use your Personal Data for recruitment-related purposes, which may include contacting you via email, telephone or post. In some cases, you may be required to register on our website in order that you may track the progress of your application online. Except where you request otherwise, Capgemini may keep your Personal Data on file for an appropriate time in order to consider you for other employment opportunities with Capgemini in the future.
  * **Discussion forums**. If you choose to participate in Capgemini discussion forums or chat rooms then, in some cases, you may be required to register certain details, such as your name and email address. You should also be aware that your comments may be made broadly available to others, inside or outside Capgemini, depending on which particular discussion forum or chat room you are accessing.
  * **Maintaining the website and conducting customer satisfaction surveys**. We will use your Personal Data in order to maintain and improve our website.  We may also use your Personal Data in order to conduct customer satisfaction surveys.
  * **Compiling aggregate statistics regarding the use of the website**.

##    
Global organization

Capgemini is a global organization. Whilst we have distinct legal entities (e.g., country subsidiaries) in many parts of the world, our internal processes and infrastructure are international in scope and nature and generally cross country borders. Accordingly, you should be aware that we may share your Personal Data inside Capgemini and transfer it to countries in the world where we have data centers or otherwise do business, including those located outside the European Union (EU). In these instances, Capgemini will process your Personal Data in the manner described by this Policy and in accordance with applicable law.

Capgemini is taking into account the invalidation by the Court of Justice of the European Union of the Safe Harbor program for its personal data transfers to the United States. The impact of this decision on Capgemini is limited since none of the US Capgemini entities is Safe Harbor certified (other than IGATE). For personal data transfers from its EU to its US entities, Capgemini signs EU Standard Model Clauses. 

##    
Third-party suppliers

Like many organizations, we use third-party suppliers to collect, use and otherwise process Personal Data on our behalf. Our practice is to require such third parties to handle Personal Data in accordance with Capgemini’s Privacy Policy.

After the Safe Harbor invalidation by the Court of Justice of the European Union, Capgemini is asking its US third-party suppliers to sign the EU Standard Model Clauses. 

##    
Business reorganizations

Like many organizations, Capgemini may reorganize its business operations around the world from time to time, whether by buying new businesses or selling or merging existing businesses. This may involve us disclosing Personal Data to prospective or actual purchasers of parts of our business, or receiving Personal Data from potential sellers.  It is our practice to seek appropriate confidentiality protection for Personal Data disclosed in these types of transactions.

##    
Legal disclosures

Capgemini may disclose your Personal Data in order to enforce our website Terms of Use or in urgent circumstances to protect personal safety, the public or Capgemini’s websites. It is also possible that we may be required by law to disclose your Personal Data pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders, potentially, in any country where we do business.

##    
Sensitive Personal Data

As a general rule, Capgemini does not collect “Sensitive Personal Data” through its website. “Sensitive Personal Data” means Personal Data concerning racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, or concerning health or sex life. By volunteering unsolicited sensitive Personal Data to us (e.g., by submitting your resume or a job application online), you expressly consent to your Personal Data being used as described in this Policy.

##    
Requests regarding your Personal Data: access, correction, update and deletion

Subject to applicable law and certain exemptions, you may have the right to access, rectify, oppose the processing, or delete your Personal Data.

In order to exercise these rights so that updates, corrections and/or deletions can be made in accordance with applicable law, you can:

  * either correct or delete your profile on our website;
  * or complete and submit this Personal Data request [form](http://www.capgemini.com/events/data-privacy-policy-contact-form).



##    
Data security and integrity

Capgemini uses various technological and procedural security measures in order to protect the Personal Data we collect, use or transfer from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. However, you should be aware that, due to the open and unsecured character of the Internet, Capgemini cannot be responsible for the security of transmissions of the Personal Data over the Internet.

##    
Third-party websites

Capgemini websites may provide links to third-party websites. Capgemini does not make any representations or warranties with respect to such third-party websites. You should be aware that the owners and operators of such third-party websites might collect, use or transfer Personal Data under different terms and conditions than Capgemini. Upon linking to a third-party website, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies of such third-party websites. 

##    
Notification of changes to this Policy

This Policy is effective in August 2014 (the “ **Effective Date** ”). In order to check updates to this Policy, please consult this page on a regular basis.
