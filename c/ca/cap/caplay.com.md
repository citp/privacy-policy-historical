Welcome to CAPLAY.com!  


CAPLAY.com believes that maintaining and preserving the privacy of user data is of the utmost importance. This Privacy Policy represents a committed effort to safeguard the security of the limited user information that is collected and retained on our servers. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through CAPLAY.com and not to information collected offline or to information you may provide to any third-party sites to which CAPLAY.com may link, except as expressly provided herein.  


**Information We Collect**

  
There are two kinds of information that CAPLAY.com can obtain about you: “Anonymous Information” and “Personally Identifiable Information.”

  
“Anonymous Information” consists of non-personally-identifiable data, such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address or domain, or information about your usage on CAPLAY.com that is used for administrative purposes only. An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). CAPLAY.com may track such IP addresses for system administration, to help diagnose problems with our servers and to report aggregate information to our advertisers, corporate affiliates and consultants, and to third parties that perform particular services on our behalf, or to prevent our servers from being abused.

  
“Personally Identifiable Information” may include your name, home address, phone number, and/or e-mail address. We do not require this information to gain access to our sites, however, you will not be able to utilize certain products, services, or features that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.

  
When we collect Personally Identifiable Information from you, you will have the opportunity to “opt in” to receive email or other digital communications from us and/or our business partners.

  
If you have submitted your personal information to **  CAPLAY**.com, you may correct, amend or delete the Personally Identifiable Information maintained on file about you if it is incorrect.

  
In all cases, we will only use your information as permitted by law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy Policy, however, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information to others if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights and property; (c) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site; or (d) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public. Please note that we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.

  
**Use of “Cookies”**

  
Cookies are a feature of your Web browser that allows Web sites to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes.  CAPLAY.com use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit CAPLAY.com. In addition, CAPLAY may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional, marketing, or security purposes.

**Disclosure of Information through Business Transfers**

  
As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, and in so doing, acquire customer information. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. Similarly, in the event that a portion or all of CAPLAY.com's assets are sold or transferred to a third party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets.
