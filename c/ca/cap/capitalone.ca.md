# Capital One Privacy Policy

**Capital One's Privacy Commitment to You** Capital One is committed to keeping your personal information accurate, confidential, and secure. We want to earn your trust by providing strict safeguards to protect your information. 

**Your Privacy**

We respect your privacy. Not only do we respect it, but we also protect it. The personal information you share with us stays with us. We do, however, provide or collect your information as is required by law. We may also release your information to companies and organizations that you have authorized us to release information to, including service providers (such as the printers of our account statements) and credit reporting agencies (like TransUnion and Equifax).These service providers must first meet our rigorous privacy standards before we partner with them to do business for you.

**What is Personal Information?**

Personal information is information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title, business address or business telephone number of an employee of an organization.

 **Information Quality**

If you believe that the information we have about you is not as accurate or complete as it could be, please contact us via any of the methods noted in Your Privacy Choices and How to Contact Us so we can update your information.

 **Access to Personal Information about You**

You may request access to the personal information we collect about you.  We will answer your inquiry and/or provide you with access to this information, subject to certain considerations specified by law. To request access to your personal information in our possession, write to us at P.O. Box 515, Scarborough Stn D, Scarborough, ON MIR 5N4, Attention: Canada Privacy Officer. 

**Confidentiality and Security**

We have physical security (access in buildings), electronic protection (encryption), and safe business practices (customer authentication when you call us) to prevent identity theft. We restrict access your personal information to those who need to have it to provide products or services to you. We use other companies to provide services for us such as marketing, advertising, and credit card embossing, but select these companies carefully and require them to keep the information we share with them safe and secure. We do not allow them to use or share information for any purpose other than the job they are hired to do.

 **Information We Collect**

 _Consumers._ We may collect information about consumers who are not our current customers, so we can develop our products and services. Sometimes this information comes from lists of potential customers such as magazine subscription lists. When a consumer applies to be our customer, we collect the information given during the application process (such as the consumer's name, address, and date of birth). 

_Customers._ When you are a customer, we collect and store information to help us verify the effectiveness of our products and services, to monitor your usage and to better tailor our services to your needs and interests. We collect information about your transactions, including purchases, account balances, fees, payment history, parties to transactions, and credit card usage. We may collect information from credit reporting agencies and other outside sources to verify financial information about you, such as your employment and credit history. 

_Web site visits._ When you visit our Web site, we may collect information about your use of our products and services, which is captured in a common log file format, including your Internet Protocol ("IP") address and operating system, the date and time of your visit and information about the pages you visit while on our Web site. To assist us in collecting information when you visit us online, we may use electronic technologies such as cookies (small computer files saved to your computer's hard drive) which help us understand what parts of our products and services you find most useful.

You can contact your internet browser's web site directly to learn how to perform this task.

     (ii) to verify your identity and credit worthiness; 

     (iii) to protect you from identity theft, fraud and unauthorized access to your account; 

     (iv) to share application and transaction information with consumer reporting agencies and other parties who   
           have financial, employment, or business dealings with you and; 

     (v) to use for any purpose required by law. 

This information may also be shared with any person or entity to which we have assigned or transferred an interest in your account, any debt or interest due or any of our rights or obligations under any agreement with you (including any subsequent assignee). We may also use your information to respond to your questions or to contact you in order to notify you of functional changes to our Web site or to our products and services. If you choose to contact us, we may retain your e-mail address, the content of your communication and our response. 

In the event that a service vendor is located outside Canada, your personal information may be located outside of Canada and will be subject to the same levels of security while also being subject to the laws of the jurisdiction in which the information is held.

We may share customer information with other parties who have financial, employment or business dealings with you. If you give us your Social Insurance Number, we may use it to identify you with credit reporting agencies and other parties, and we may keep it along with other information about you in our records, even after your account is closed to use for the purposes stated above.
