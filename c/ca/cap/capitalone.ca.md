### Table of Contents

### 1\. Privacy Commitment and Personal Information

We collect, use and disclose personal information to operate our business and as required by law. Personal information is information about an identifiable individual, as defined in the _Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act_.

### 2\. Changes to Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes our current privacy practices. We update this Policy on an ongoing basis to ensure consumers, applicants and customers are aware of updates to our privacy practices, to streamline those practices and to comply with applicable laws. Consumers are individuals who are not currently our customers; applicants are individuals who apply to become our customers; and customers are individuals who have been approved, use or have used our products and services in the past. Please visit this site regularly for updates. We will also notify individuals with whom we have a relationship of any material changes that may impact them.

### 3\. Accountability

Our Privacy Officer is responsible for ensuring that we comply with this Policy and applicable privacy laws.

We are responsible for personal information in our possession or custody, as well as personal information transferred to a third party for processing. More details on our third parties are provided below under “Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention”.

### 4\. Information We Collect, and Limiting Collection

Except where information is required to fulfill an identified purpose, you get to decide what information you want to share with us.

**Connecting with us.** We may collect information you provide if you visit or use our website or apps, register or apply for one of our products or services, interact with us through social media or online ads, participate in surveys, or engage with us in any way. We may collect that information for uses as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Information about you.** If you sign up for one of our products or services, depending on the service, we may collect information about your transactions, including purchases, account balances, fees, payment history, parties to transactions and credit card usage. We may collect information from credit reporting agencies and other outside sources to verify financial information about you, such as your employment and credit history. If you give us your SIN, we may use it to identify you with credit reporting agencies and other parties; we may keep this information along with other information about you in our records, even after your account is closed. When you provide authorized user information, we expect that you have authority to consent to its collection, use, and disclosure as outlined in this Policy.

**Digital and online information.** We may collect information from your mobile and online activity; for example, Internet Protocol (IP) address, mobile device ID, application and website use, and history. Cookies (small computer files that a website’s server places on your computer) collect information about your online behaviour. You can set your browser to reject cookies, but this may impair our ability to customize and test your experience, like remembering your preferred language or present province-specific information to you.

**Third party service providers.** We may collect information about you from third parties that we have contracted with, such as credit reporting agencies or affiliates. We may collect publicly available information about you from online sources, or from surveys that you participate in.

**Communication.** When you have a telephone conversation with one of our representatives, your call may be recorded for quality and training purposes, as well as to resolve concerns. If you choose to contact us by email or mail, we may retain your email address, the content of your communication and our response.

### 5\. Identifying Purposes

Capital One clearly identifies the purposes for which personal information is collected, used or disclosed prior to, or at the time of, collection, and as in our cardholder agreement.

**We may use your information to contact you.** Your information allows us to contact you by various methods, including mail, email, SMS message, and telephone at the contact points you’ve provided to us. We will contact you to respond to your questions, proactively provide you with information about your account(s) with us, inform you about our products and services, and update you on changes to our website, mobile app, and other digital services we provide. We may use your information to send you important updates about your application status and account opening disclosures, and important or useful messages about your account(s). When you communicate online or by email, you should be aware that sending information over the internet isn’t secure, as it can be intercepted and/or manipulated and retransmitted.

**We may use your information to authenticate you.** With your information, we can confirm your identity by sharing your information with the credit agency to authenticate you when you apply for a product or service, to verify that it’s you we are speaking with when you call our Customer Service number to discuss your account, or identify you when you visit us online or on our mobile app.

**We may use your information to assess your creditworthiness.** With your information, we can assess your creditworthiness to determine your eligibility for products and services, and process your application(s). This information is helpful for us to offer you product choices that are suitable for you. In order to do this, we will provide your information to, and collect information about you from credit reporting agencies (refer to section 7 Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention for [information on third party sharing](https://web.archive.org/#basic-info-tp)).

**We may use your information to service you.** Your information may be used to maintain, service, process, analyze, audit and collect on your account(s). For example, loyalty reward numbers and program statuses are used to align your account with cobranded credit card loyalty rewards providers. We may use your information to service your mobile account, optimize our website, perform analytics, and provide you with a unique user experience. We may also send notifications and support mobile payments with this information. When we issue you a new card, we may provide your new account information to facilitate your payments, pursuant to industry standards (refer to section 7 Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention for [information on third party sharing](https://web.archive.org/#basic-info-tp2)).

**We may use your information to make improvements.** We may use your personal information to evaluate existing products and services, develop new products and services, drive strategy and improve the customer experience we offer. Information we collect is also valuable for our quality and servicing training programs.

We also customize our website and mobile applications based on information collected, and use that information to understand and deliver products and services that you, and others who are similar to you, may find useful. The information is used to better understand our website and mobile application activity, and how users interact with our digital sites. It’s also used to monitor and improve our website and mobile applications.

**We may use your information to prevent fraud.** We may use your information to assess fraud and other risks to you and Capital One, and to protect consumers, applicants and customers from identity theft, fraud and unauthorized account access. When investigating fraud, we may ask for identification documents (such as a Canadian driver’s licence, Canadian passport, birth certificate, utility bill or bank statement, or other forms of identification).

**We may use your information to serve you offers, advertising and marketing.** Elements of your personal information may be used to determine your suitability, or to directly communicate with you, for targeted advertising, marketing, promotions, rewards programs, research or contests. You may see advertisements for our products and services on our website, mobile applications or on third-party websites, based on your online or mobile activity and information you’ve shared with third parties.

We may use your personal information to identify you on third-party platforms you already use (such as Facebook and Twitter) and serve you ads through their marketing platforms. We may also use your information to identify you on third-party platforms (such as Facebook and Google), and then use the algorithms of those platforms to find other people with similar characteristics.

Where your credit score is used for the purposes of advertising, express opt-in consent will be captured from you at the time of collection.

We may prevent you from seeing Capital One offers that are unsuitable for you, based on the information we know about you. For example, if you are already a customer, we don’t want to serve you ads for products and services you already have with us.

You can opt out of offers, advertising and marketing uses of your information, and opt out of the use of cookies by following the instructions in the “Consent” section below.

**We may use your information to report.** We may share application and transaction information with consumer reporting agencies and other parties who have financial, employment or business dealings with you.

If you apply for a credit product, communicate with us or provide personal information to us in any way, you acknowledge your consent for personal information collection, use and disclosure as set out in this Policy, applicable laws and industry standards. If we want to use your information for a purpose that was not disclosed at the time of initial consent, consent will be sought at the time of this new purpose.

**Updating consent.** Subject to legal and contractual restrictions, you can, with reasonable notice to Capital One, withdraw your consent for use and disclosure of your personal information, other than that which is required for us to maintain your account and to provide services for which you were approved.

**Opt out of mail, email and phone marketing.** You can request that we don’t contact you for advertising, marketing, promotions, rewards programs, research or contests, by updating your privacy preferences. You should know that withdrawing your consent in these instances may result in you missing out on offers specific to your account, like credit limit increases.

While Capital One takes all reasonable measures to protect data, there is always inherent risk when providing personal information. You can help us safeguard your information too.

If someone ‘representing Capital One’ contacts you and requests your personal or financial information, and you are suspicious, you can always contact us to confirm that the request was legitimate. We also recommend that you use unique and strong passwords for your online account(s) and that you don’t share your passwords with anyone.
