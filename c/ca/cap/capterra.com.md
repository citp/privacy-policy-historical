Capterra.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors’ personally identifiable information.  To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is used at the site. 

_**Information We Collect and How We Use It**_

To enable visitors to take advantage of Capterra’s services, we collect certain types of personally identifiable information from both software vendors and software buyers.

_Software Vendors’ Personally Identifiable Information_

We may collect the following types of personally identifiable information from vendors to enable them to have their company and product information listed on our site:  company name and a company contact’s name, e-mail, and telephone number.  In addition, we collect certain information about the vendor’s company including location of headquarters and number of employees and customers. 

The information that we collect from software vendors enables them to offer buyers opportunities to learn about products and services and to facilitate enterprise software transactions.

_Software Users’ and Purchasers’ Personally Identifiable Information_

We do not require software buyers to register in order to do research using Capterra’s website. However, if a buyer chooses to fill out an RFI form, or a Contact Vendor form, we collect personally identifiable information including name, company name, email address, and phone number.

We pass this information on to software vendors when software buyers request us to do so.

_Non-Personally Identifiable Information_

We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about our visitors when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using ( _e.g.,_ Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, ( _e.g._ , Windows NT or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider ( _e.g.,_ America Online, Earthlink).

We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience.  We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products or services. 

_Legal Process_

We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency’s request.

_**Choices/Opt-Out**_

Capterra may contact software vendors to let them know about potential sales leads.  If you prefer not to receive information from this site, just let us know by responding directly to the email or contacting _[bizdev@capterra.com](mailto:bizdev@capterra.com)_. 

_**Cookies**_

To enhance your experience with our site, we may use “cookies.”  Cookies are text files we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences.  Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites.  However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. 

We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites.  For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites.  We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.

_**Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors**_

Our site contains links to other Web sites ( _e.g.,_ sites that provide information on specific software categories) whose information practices may be different than ours.  Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

We sometimes may offer promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third parties.  By virtue of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the promotion. Capterra has no control over the third-party sponsors' use of this information.  Capterra will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if third-party sponsors will obtain such information.

_**Security**_

We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent against unauthorized access to information that we collect online.
