Changing Caption.iT's website linking codes or removing the Caption.iT logo from images is prohibited. You may not upload any files that can be even remotely construed as pornographic, copyrighted material, harassment, spam, illegal, or in violation of any United States laws.

</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><strong><u>Privacy Statement for Caption.iT</u></strong><br>
  </font>At Caption.iT we are committed to providing you information 
  tailored to your individual wants and needs. We also recognize the importance 
  of protecting personally identifiable information relating to you, our users 
  and subscribers. Caption.iT does not collect personally identifying 
  information about individuals, except when specifically and knowingly provided 
  by such individuals. When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, 
  we may request your name, street, and e-mail address to aid in our administration 
  of the contest and to assist in contacting the winners. </p>
<p>Caption.iT utilizes specialized "Server Software" to automatically 
  collect information about which pages each user visits as well as the user's 
  Internet Service Provider (e.g., aol.com). This information is used for internal 
  review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for traffic audits. 
</p>
<p>Under no circumstances will we give specific, identifiable information about 
  our users to outside third parties. However, we will, from time to time, provide 
  advertisers or potential advertisers with aggregated, anonymous information 
  about our users. In addition, any personally identifiable information provided 
  by subscribers as part of an advertiser promotion within one of our partner 
  sites may be provided to such advertisers as needed for the reasonable administration 
  of the promotion. We also reserve the right to amend these policies at any time 
  by updating this page so check back often as your right may change ongoing. 
  we reserve the right to sell our business and in some cases that may include 
  data that is gathered at our websites If this is the case you will receive an 
  initial opt out message from new management and at that time may opt out of 
  further messages. </p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve our ads on the Internet. 
  These third-party advertising companies employ cookie and 1x1 pixel .gif technology 
  to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. To do so, 
  these companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our Web site 
  and other Web sites. This information can include: date/time of banner ad shown, 
  the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, the IP address. This information 
  can also be used for online preference marketing purposes. </p>
<p>If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from setting and/or reading 
  cookies on your computer, currently you may either visit each ad network's web 
  site individually and opt out or visit the NAI gateway opt-out site to opt-out 
  of all network advertising cookies. <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_optout">Click 
  Here</a> for the NAI gateway opt-out site. This site will also allow you to 
  review the third-party advertising companies' privacy policies. </p>
<p>A user's personally identifiable information (e.g., name, e-mail address) may 
  be required in certain instances. For example, if we run competitions or contests 
  on the site, you may be required to provide information such as your address 
  in order to participate. The exact rules may vary in each case but the specific 
  rules for any contest will state how that information may be used. We may also 
  use personally identifiable information for marketing and promotional purposes. 
  Caption.iT may send you e-mail alerting you to new features, products, 
  promotions, or services pertaining to our site. </p>
<p>We do not control the privacy policies of our business partners, advertisers, 
  sponsors or other sites to which we provide hyperlinks. Users should also be 
  aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas, 
  bulletin boards, or other public forums, such information may be collected by 
  others and may result in the receipt of unsolicited messages. </p>
<p><u>Children</u>: Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information 
  about yourself - like your name, address, or e-mail address - over the Internet, 
  to us or to anyone else and before making any purchases online. </p>
<p><u>Parents</u>: We encourage you to get involved with your children's online usage 
  and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. We will not 
  knowingly gather personally identifiable information from children under the 
  age of 13 when at all possible. </p>
<p>Anonymous aggregated data is sometimes provided to other parties which we do 
  business with, for statistical and market research purposes as described above.</p>
<p>Finally you should be aware that if your child voluntarily discloses his or 
  her name, e-mail address, etc. within various public forums (including bulletin 
  boards and chat rooms), such disclosures may result in unsolicited messages 
  from other parties.</p>
<p>Technology on the Internet is developing at a fever pace. It is critical that 
  Caption.iT maintain its ability to rapidly adjust these policies in 
  the future. By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of 
  this information by Caption.iT. If we decide to change our privacy 
  policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware 
  of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances 
  we disclose it. </p>
