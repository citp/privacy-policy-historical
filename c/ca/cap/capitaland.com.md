# Privacy Policy | CapitaLand

**CapitaLand Group's Personal Data Protection Policy**

**Personal Data Protection is important to us**

Protection of your Personal Data is important to us. This CapitaLand Personal Data Protection Policy (“ **Policy** ”) outlines how we manage the Personal Data we hold. The Policy applies to all departments and business units across the CapitaLand Group. CapitaLand Limited (Reg. No. 198900036N), and/or its related corporations and affiliates (referred to hereunder as “CapitaLand”, the “CapitaLand Group”, “we”, “us” or “our”) collectively or singularly as the context requires, recognise the importance of protecting Personal Data.

We respect the confidentiality of Personal Data and privacy of individuals and are committed to complying with the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (Act 26 of 2012) (“ **PDPA** ”) and other applicable data protection laws, including the European Union (“ **EU** ”) General Data Protection Regulation (“ **GDPR** ”) where applicable. Please read this Policy so that you know and understand the purposes for which we collect, use and disclose your Personal Data.

We adopt a pragmatic “Data- _light_ , Data- _tight_ ” approach in our business conduct.

“Data- _light_ ” means that we collect Personal Data only for what is required in business or in activities conducted by our organisation and will properly destroy the Personal Data once there is no business or legal purpose. We do not collect Personal Data randomly or indiscriminately without purpose.

“Data- _tight_ ” means that we do not disclose your Personal Data unless prior consent has been obtained and we have administrative, physical and Information Technology (IT) security measures to protect your Personal Data.

This Policy supplements but does not supersede nor replace any other consents you may have previously provided to us in respect of your Personal Data, and your consents herein are additional to any rights which any member of the CapitaLand Group may have at law to collect, use or disclose your Personal Data. This Policy does not affect any rights which we may have at law in connection with the collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Data.

For the avoidance of doubt, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, nothing in this Policy establishes any joint and several liability on the part of the CapitaLand Group members.

1.             Your Personal Data

1.1.         “ **Personal Data** ” refers to any data or information about you from which you can be identified either (a) from that data alone; or (b) from that data combined with other information. Examples of such Personal Data which you may provide us include (depending on the nature of your interaction with us):

a)            your name, NRIC number, passport number or other identification number, telephone number(s), mailing address, email address and any other information relating to you which you have provided us in any form you may have submitted to us, or in other forms of interaction with you;
