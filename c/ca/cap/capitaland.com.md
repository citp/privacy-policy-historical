# Privacy Policy | CapitaLand

**CapitaLand Group's Personal Data Protection Policy**

**Personal Data Protection is important to us**  


Protection of your Personal Data is important to us. This CapitaLand Personal Data Protection Policy (“ **Policy** ”) outlines how we manage the Personal Data we hold. The Policy applies to all departments and business units across the CapitaLand Group. CapitaLand Limited (Reg. No. 198900036N), and/or its related corporations and affiliates (referred to hereunder as “CapitaLand”, the “CapitaLand Group”, “we”, “us” or “our”) collectively or singularly as the context requires, recognise the importance of protecting Personal Data.  


We respect the confidentiality of Personal Data and privacy of individuals and are committed to complying with the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (Act 26 of 2012) (“ **PDPA** ”) and other applicable data protection laws, including the European Union (“ **EU** ”) General Data Protection Regulation (“ **GDPR** ”) where applicable. Please read this Policy so that you know and understand the purposes for which we collect, use and disclose your Personal Data.

We adopt a pragmatic “Data- _light_ , Data- _tight_ ” approach in our business conduct.

“Data- _light_ ” means that we collect Personal Data only for what is required in business or in activities conducted by our organisation and will properly destroy the Personal Data once there is no business or legal purpose. We do not collect Personal Data randomly or indiscriminately without purpose.

“Data- _tight_ ” means that we do not disclose your Personal Data unless prior consent has been obtained and we have administrative, physical and Information Technology (IT) security measures to protect your Personal Data.

This Policy supplements but does not supersede nor replace any other consents you may have previously provided to us in respect of your Personal Data, and your consents herein are additional to any rights which any member of the CapitaLand Group may have at law to collect, use or disclose your Personal Data. This Policy does not affect any rights which we may have at law in connection with the collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Data.

For the avoidance of doubt, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, nothing in this Policy establishes any joint and several liability on the part of the CapitaLand Group members.

1.             Your Personal Data

1.1.         “ **Personal Data** ” refers to any data or information about you from which you can be identified either (a) from that data alone; or (b) from that data combined with other information.

a)            your name, national registration identification number, passport number or other identification number, telephone number(s), mailing address, email address, facial image in a photograph or video recording, fingerprint and any other information relating to you which you have provided us in any form you may have submitted to us, or in other forms of interaction with you;

1.3.           In addition, if your Personal Data has been collected, used or disclosed by us in a particular jurisdiction which has specific requirements or exceptions to the definition of Personal Data, including sensitive Personal Data, we will comply with those requirements under the applicable data protection regulations in that jurisdiction.

As a requirement under these laws, we may be required to have specific agreements in place with such third parties to regulate and safeguard your data protection rights. We also require that these organisations use this information only for our purposes and follow our directions with respect to this information.  


4.             Transfer of Personal Data

4.1        Your Personal Data may be stored in external servers located overseas. In addition, as described above, in carrying out our business, it may be necessary to share information about you with and between our related corporations and affiliates, and third party service providers, some of which may be located in countries outside your country of residence. Such countries may not afford a standard of protection similar to those in your country of residence. However, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your Personal Data transmitted outside of your country of residence is adequately protected. In addition, we will ensure that such transfers comply with the requirements of the applicable data protection laws.  


4.2        In respect of our activities in EU, where your Personal Data is transferred to locations outside the European Economic Area, we have entered into a special type of contract (called European Commission Model Contractual Clauses) with the recipients of your Personal Data to ensure that they will provide adequate levels of protection for your Personal Data. If you wish, you may request for more information about the transfers of your Personal Data and/or a copy of the European Commission Model Contractual Clauses by contacting the relevant Data Protection Officer at the contact details provided in paragraph 12.1 below.  


5.         Retention of Personal Data  


5.1        We may retain your Personal Data for as long as it is necessary for the purposes it has been collected, and (i) in most cases, up to 7 years; or (ii) in respect of our activities in the EU, up to 10 years, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law or in order to defend legal claims. Where we no longer require your Personal Data for those purposes, we will cease to retain such Personal Data in accordance with our internal retention policy.  


6.         Your Rights  


6.1       You have the following rights, under applicable data protection laws (except where the exercise of these are restricted under applicable laws – for example, due to judicial proceedings or the carrying out of investigations), which can be exercised by contacting the relevant Data Protection Officer at the contact details provided in paragraph 12.1 below:  


a)            to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not your Personal Data is being processed and request a copy of your information. Where legally required, we will provide your information in an easily accessible format and assist in transferring some of this information to third parties;

b)            rectification of your Personal Data. We endeavour to ensure that all Personal Data we have about you is accurate and up-to-date. We understand that this information changes frequently with changes of address and other personal circumstances. We encourage you to contact us as soon as possible to enable us to update any Personal Data we have about you. Incomplete or outdated Personal Data may result in our inability to provide you with products and services you have requested;

c)            where the processing of your Personal Data is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your Personal Data you have provided us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format or to demand transmission to another controller;

d)            in certain circumstances, you can request to have your Personal Data deleted or restrict the processing of it;

e)                  if we process your information based on our legitimate interests explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is necessary for legal reasons. Where we use your data for direct marketing purposes, you can always object using the unsubscribe link in such communications or by contacting us at the details provided in paragraph 12.1 below;

f)             prevent any processing of Personal Data that is causing or is likely to cause unwarranted and substantial damage or distress to you or another individual;

g)            be informed about any use of your Personal Data to make automated decisions about you where such decisions produce legal effects or have similarly significant effects on you, and to obtain meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of this processing; and

h)            to lodge a complaint about the way in which your Personal Data is being used to a supervisory authority. If you are located in the EU, you can contact the supervisory authority in the EU member state of your habitual residence or place of work or where the relevant member of the CapitaLand Group which has used your Personal Data is located.

6.2       Where we rely on your consent to use your Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This withdrawal will however not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before your withdrawal.  


If you withdraw your consent to any or all purposes and depending on the nature of your request, we may not be in a position to continue to provide our products or services to you. Please note, however, that if you have provided us consent in respect of the use of your Singapore telephone number(s) for receiving marketing or promotional information, any such consent provided will not be affected by your withdrawal of your other consent in accordance with the terms set out in this Policy.  If you do not wish for your Singapore telephone number(s) to be used for receiving marketing or promotional information, please contact the relevant Data Protection Officer and specify that you wish to withdraw your consent for such purpose.

6.3 **        **Where we process your Personal Data based on the legitimate interests referred to in paragraph 3.3 above, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is necessary for legal reasons. ****

6.4       Where mandated under the applicable data protection laws, your exercise of the rights described or referred to above shall be free of charge. In all other situations, we may charge a fee to cover the cost of verifying the request and locating, retrieving and copying any material requested.

6.5        If you want to exercise any of your rights or if you wish to raise a complaint on how CapitaLand Group has handled your Personal Data, you may contact the relevant Data Protection Officer at the contact details provided in paragraph 12.1 below.
