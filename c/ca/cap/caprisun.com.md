# Kraftfoods.com Privacy Notice - Kraft Recipes

This website is owned and operated by Kraft Foods Group, Inc. At Kraft, we recognize that visitors to our site may be concerned about the information they provide to us and how we handle that information. 

### Personally-Identifiable Information 

On our website, we collect certain personally-identifiable information, such as name, telephone number and e-mail address, about online visitors who choose to register on our website or participate in our offers and programs. We don’t require you to register or provide personally-identifiable information to view our site or access much of its content, such as our many delicious recipes. But if you register, you may use certain additional features that allow you to receive or access your favorite recipes and participate in our interactive communities.  Sharing this additional information with us also helps us customize your website experience.  In addition, we may use the information you provide us to send you offers and information about Kraft, its portfolio of brands and its partners.  Here are the ways we collect personally-identifiable information.

#### Registration

To take full advantage of our offers, you may choose to register on our site. In the registration process, we request certain information (such as your contact information and age) so we can provide you with the communications you request, tailor our website to better meet your needs and customize our contacts with you.

Our site contains notices of contests, sweepstakes and games that you can enter. We use the information you provide to conduct the promotion (for example, to contact you if you’re a winner).

When you ask us to send you recipes, cooking ideas, or other content by e-mail, you may provide us with certain information like your e-mail address so we can fulfill your request.

Remember that what you post or upload to the site will be publicly available, so please exercise caution when deciding whether to disclose anything personal about yourself. Kraft cannot control the actions of third parties who may view the website and use publicly-available information for their own purposes.

#### "Contact Us" Link

If you contact us through the "Contact Us" link on this site, we ask you for information such as your first name, e-mail address, and other information, so we can respond to your questions and comments. You may choose to provide additional information as well.

#### Send to a Friend

We may give you the opportunity to tell your friends about features or information on our website. If you take advantage of our Send to a Friend option, we ask you for your friend’s and your first name and e-mail addresses to send the information to them that you requested. We don’t keep or use your friend’s e-mail address for any other purpose.

#### Other Site Features

We offer visitors to our website various features for their enjoyment, which we change from time to time. We may ask you to submit certain personally-identifiable information so we can provide you with these features.

#### Questionnaires and Surveys

We may ask our website visitors and purchasers to complete surveys and opinion polls to provide feedback on activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys help us understand the needs of our visitors and purchasers.

#### Information Collected By Automated Means 

We may use cookies, web beacons/pixel tags, log files, and other technologies to collect certain information about visitors to our website, use of our online services, and interactions with our emails and online advertisements. For example, through these means, we may collect your browser type and operating system, viewed webpages, links that are clicked, IP address, sites visited before coming to our website, emails we send that you open, forward, or click through to our website. Collecting this information, and linking it with your personally-identifiable information, helps us to best tailor our website and enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site, and to help identify site features, recipes, advertisements, and offers that may be of particular interest to you.

We also may use third party advertisements placed by ad networks to support our site. Some of these advertisers and ad networks may use technology such as cookies and web beacons/pixel tags when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers and ad networks information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and whether you have Flash installed. Some of these advertisers and ad networks also may use anonymous data, such as demographic data, received from third parties to assist in the delivery of advertisements to you. These advertisers and ad networks use the information described above to provide you relevant advertisements based on your online behavior, search activities on our site and on other third party sites, demographic information and/or relevant to your general location, so that the advertising you see on our site more closely reflects your interests and needs. For example, if you search for, or browse a, recipe or product on our site, you may see an advertisement from a third party with information about, or an offer similar to, that for which you were searching or browsing on our site, or an offer related to a third party whose site you have visited in the past.

You can set your Internet browser settings to stop accepting new cookies, to receive notice when you receive a new cookie, to disable existing cookies, and to omit images (which will disable pixel tags). Note that the opt-out will apply only to the browser that you are using when you elect to opt out of advertising cookies. You can learn more about and opt out from receiving third party advertiser cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out page [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). Without cookies or pixel tags though, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of Kraft’s website features.

#### Information Collected From Other Sources 

We may obtain information about you from other sources, including commercially available sources, such as data aggregators and public databases. This information may include name, demographic information, interests, and publicly-observed data, such as from social media and shopping behavior. We may combine this information with the information we collect from you to help us tailor our communications to you and to improve our services and products.

### How We Use Your Information

We may use the information we collect to contact you from time to time. For example, we may (i) send you promotional offers, materials, and other communications and information about Kraft, its portfolio of brands and its partners, (ii) respond to your comments or questions, or (iii) contact you if needed while processing a product or service you requested through our website. We also may use the information you provide to contact you for your opinions on Kraft products, services or websites. As described in this Privacy Notice, we also use the information we collect about you to improve our website, products and services, and to deliver content that is customized to your interests.

### How We Share Your Information 

We do not sell or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information about our website visitors, except as described here. We do not share your personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing purposes without your consent. For California residents, please see “Your California Privacy Rights” below.

We may share personally identifiable information among Kraft brands and subsidiaries. We may also share the information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf, such as to help run promotions, fulfill orders and provide customer service. These service providers may have access to personally-identifiable information about our website visitors if it is needed to perform their functions for Kraft, but they are not authorized by Kraft to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on Kraft’s behalf or to comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information where we think it’s necessary to investigate or prevent an actual or suspected crime or injury to ourselves or others, if required by law, or in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials.

We may conduct joint promotions with other companies. We may share with our promotional partners (and their service providers) certain personally-identifiable information as necessary to conduct the promotion. We will not share this information with our promotional partners for any other purpose unless you consent to such sharing.

During the normal course of our business, Kraft may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or any of our assets, information we have collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be considered an asset of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties. Should a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personally identifiable information provided through this website in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.

#### Your California Privacy Rights

For California Residents: We may share your personally-identifiable information with affiliated third parties, some of which do not share the Kraft name, for their own direct marketing purposes. Because this category of affiliates is considered to be “unaffiliated parties” under California Law, you may opt out of us sharing with them. To opt out, please send a letter with your name, postal address, e-mail, with the heading “California Privacy Rights” to: 

Kraft Foods Group, Inc.

### Links To Other Websites

This website may contain links to other websites. We provide these links solely for your convenience and information. Different websites have different privacy practices. You should always check the privacy notice of the specific site you’re visiting to understand the privacy practices associated with that site. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third party websites.

### Your Choices

You can change your preferences for follow-up contacts by Kraft. If you’re registered with our website, you can change the information you’ve provided to us in the "Your Profile" section of the site. If you’re not registered with this site, you can change your preferences by [clicking here](http://www.kraftrecipes.com/registration/contextualsignuplogin.aspx). If you prefer, you can cancel your registration altogether. [E-mail](http://kraftfoods.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/kraftfoods.cfg/php/enduser/std_alp.php?p_search_text=) us if you wish to take this action.

### Children's Privacy 

Some portions of our website may be directed to children under 13. In these areas of our website, our conduct is governed by federal law and regulations that address children’s online privacy, as well as by the guidelines of the Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU), a part of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you are under 13, please be sure to read this notice with your parent or legal guardian.

We do not knowingly collect personally-identifiable information from children under 13 on our website, except as permitted by legal requirements and the CARU guidelines. We sometimes offer promotions on our website, such as contests, sweepstakes and games, which children may enter. In those cases, we do not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the promotion as a condition of participation. If we need more than just your child’s first name (or screen name) and e-mail address for your child to participate in a particular online promotion, we will ask your child for your e-mail address so that we can notify you of your child’s request and obtain your permission. When we ask for your permission, we will tell you what we will do with the information that you or your child provides us. In addition, if a child under 13 signs up with us for an email newsletter or other online activity that requires more than one online contact, we also ask the child for your email address so that we can notify you and give you the opportunity to opt your child out of further communications from us. Unless you have explicitly consented, we do not (i) use your child’s personal information for any purpose other than to complete the promotion or (ii) share the information with third parties except as described above in this Privacy Notice. We do not keep your (or your child’s) email address unless you tell us it is okay.

We permit children under the age of 13 to contact us through the website "Contact Us" link with questions or comments. We request only the child’s first name and e-mail address and use that information solely to respond directly to the child on a one-time basis. We do not use the information to recontact the child and we delete the child’s personal information from our database after responding to the child’s inquiry.

Upon proper identification, a parent may review any personal information we have collected from his or her child if we still have the information in our database. The parent also may request that the child’s information be deleted from our database and may refuse to permit further collection or use of the child’s information. If you are a parent and wish to exercise these rights, please contact us as described below.

### How We Protect Your Information 

The security of personally-identifiable information is important to us. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the personally-identifiable information we collect on this website.

### Updates To This Privacy Notice 

We may change or update portions of this Privacy Notice at any time. Please check back from time to time so you are aware of any changes or updates to the notice. We will indicate the notice’s effective date on the first page of the notice.
