 <p class="lead"></p> <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Capgemini believes that the establishment
of trust and privacy is instrumental to the continued growth of the
Internet.&nbsp; We also believe that the
efficient collection, use and transfer of information serve to enhance the
development of the Internet and electronic commerce, provided that such
information is handled in a fair and responsible manner. Therefore, in order to
inform you of our policies and activities with respect to the collection, use
and transfer of personal data on the Internet, Capgemini is providing you with
an electronic copy of this Policy.&nbsp; This
Policy applies to websites in the European Union that are owned and operated by
Cap Gemini S.A. and/or companies that Cap Gemini S.A. controls, directly or
indirectly (collectively, “Capgemini”), unless a particular website displays
its own privacy policy (e.g., <a href="http://www.sogeti.com/">www.sogeti.com</a>).&nbsp;
Cap Gemini S.A. or one of companies that
Cap Gemini S.A. controls, directly or indirectly, is the data controller
with
respect to personal data collected and processed via its respective
website.&nbsp; In this capacity, each of these Capgemini entities is
registered with appropriate data protection authorities with
respect to the processing of personal data via such websites.</p>
<p>In this
Policy, “Personal Data” means information which relates to an individual and
which identifies that individual, either directly or indirectly (together with
other information that is reasonably likely to come into Capgemini’s
possession), such as your name, e-mail address or telephone number.</p>
<h2>Collection of Personal Data</h2>
<p>Generally, you can visit Capgemini websites
without providing any Personal Data about yourself.&nbsp; However, for accessing some parts of our
websites, such as downloading certain documents, or in connection with another
specific purpose, we may need to collect Personal Data from you.&nbsp; Providing Personal Data to us in these events
is voluntary.&nbsp; If you do not provide
Personal Data to us, then you will not be able to benefit from the respective
functionality offered by our websites, such as communication, downloading of
documents or recruitment.&nbsp; The purposes,
for which your Personal Data is collected, are described below, along with a
brief description of how your Personal Data may be handled in each case.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communicating with you</strong>.&nbsp; We will follow up on comments and other
requests that you submit to us through our website, such as online queries
or registering your attendance at a conference.&nbsp; This may include calling you back by
telephone or communicating with you via email. </li>
<li><strong>Direct marketing and promotion</strong>.&nbsp; Direct marketing and/or promotional
efforts by or on behalf of Capgemini may include providing you with
specific information that you have requested online or providing more
general information about other Capgemini offerings.&nbsp; When we collect Personal Data for direct
marketing or promotional purposes, however, we generally offer you
appropriate choices regarding the use of your Personal Data.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>Recruitment</strong>.&nbsp; If you submit a resume or job
application online, we will use your Personal Data for recruitment-related
purposes, which may include contacting you via email, telephone or
post.&nbsp; In some cases, you may be
required to register on our website in order that you may track the
progress of your application online.&nbsp; Except where you request otherwise,
Capgemini may keep your Personal Data on file for an appropriate time in
order to consider you for other employment opportunities with Capgemini in
the future.</li>
<li><strong>Supplier administration</strong>.&nbsp; Some Capgemini websites enable
third-party suppliers to register their interest in supplying products and
services to Capgemini.&nbsp; We will use
this Personal Data in connection with entering into or performing a
transaction with the supplier and for other procurement-related purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion forums</strong>.&nbsp; If you choose to participate in
Capgemini discussion forums or chat rooms then, in some cases, you may be
required to register certain details, such as your name and email address.&nbsp; You should also be aware that your
comments may be made broadly available to others, inside or outside
Capgemini, depending on which particular discussion forum or chat room you
are accessing.</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining the
website and conducting customer satisfaction surveys</strong>. We will use your Personal Data in order to maintain and
improve our website.&nbsp; We may also
use your Personal Data in order to conduct customer satisfaction surveys.</li>
<li>Compiling <strong>aggregate statistics</strong> regarding the use of its
website. </li></ul>
<h2>Cookies and clicktrails</h2>
<p>We may collect information through our
website by using cookies and clicktrails. All information collected by means of
cookies or clicktrails will be anonymised, aggregated and only used to develop
and track traffic patterns and the volume of use of our websites.&nbsp; Sometimes cookies are used to assist you in
reaching the appropriate information and to tailor your visit to your
individual preferences.&nbsp; For example, a
cookie can be used to remember your login information if you choose the
“Remember me” option while signing in.&nbsp;
If you do not want to receive a cookie from our website, you may set
your browser to refuse cookies or to notify you when you receive a cookie,
which you may then refuse upon such notice.&nbsp;
To understand how to do this, please consult your browser’s help
section.&nbsp; However, refusing the cookies
may prevent you from accessing some parts of the websites.</p>
<h2>Global organisation</h2>
<p>Capgemini is a global organisation.&nbsp; Whilst we have distinct legal entities (e.g.,
country subsidiaries) in many parts of the world, our internal processes and
infrastructure are international in scope and nature and generally cross
country borders.&nbsp; Accordingly, you should
be aware that we may share your Personal Data inside Capgemini and transfer it
to countries in the world where we have data centres or otherwise do business,
including those located outside the European Union (EU).&nbsp; Some of these countries do not have specific
data protection laws and so may provide less legal protection for your Personal
Data.&nbsp; In these instances, Capgemini will
process your Personal Data in the manner described by this Policy and in
accordance with applicable law.</p>
<h2>Third-party suppliers</h2>
<p>Like many
organisations, we use third-party suppliers to collect, use and otherwise process
Personal Data on our behalf.&nbsp; Our
practice is to require such third parties to handle Personal Data in accordance
with Capgemini’s privacy and security policies.</p>
<h2>Business reorganisations</h2>
<p>Like
many organisations, Capgemini may reorganise its business operations around the
world from time to time, whether by buying new businesses or selling or merging
existing businesses.&nbsp; This may involve us
disclosing Personal Data to prospective or actual
purchasers of parts of our business, or receiving personal data from potential
sellers.&nbsp; It is our practice to seek
appropriate confidentiality protection for Personal Data
disclosed
in these types of transactions.</p>
<h2>Legal disclosures</h2>
<p>Capgemini may disclose your Personal Data
in order to enforce our website Terms of Use or in urgent circumstances to
protect personal safety, the public or Capgemini’s websites.&nbsp; It is also possible that we may be required by law to
disclose your Personal Data pursuant to judicial or other
government subpoenas, warrants, or orders, potentially, in any country where we
do business. </p>
<h2>Sensitive Personal Data</h2>
<p>As a general rule, Capgemini does not
collect “Sensitive Personal Data” through its website.&nbsp; “Sensitive Personal Data” means Personal Data
concerning racial or ethnic origin, political
opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, or
concerning health or sex life.&nbsp; By
volunteering unsolicited sensitive Personal Data to us (e.g., by submitting
your resume or a job application online), you expressly consent to your
Personal Data being used as described in this Policy.</p>
<h2>Accessing, correcting, updating and
deleting Personal Data</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns
regarding this Policy, or would like to request a copy of your Personal Data,
then please fill-in <a href="/contactus/?r_subject=Privacy+policy&amp;r_type=2">this form</a>. Also, if you consider your
Personal Data to be incorrect or wish to have it deleted, then please either
<a href="/registration/">sign-in</a>
and update, correct or delete your profile on our website or fill-in <a href="/contactus/?r_subject=Privacy+policy&amp;r_type=2">this form</a> so that Capgemini may make any necessary updates, corrections and/or
deletions.</p>
<h2>Data security and integrity</h2>
<p>Capgemini uses various technological and
procedural security measures in order to protect the Personal Data we collect,
use or transfer from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction.&nbsp; However, you should be aware that, due to the
open and unsecured character of the Internet, Capgemini can not be responsible
for the security of transmissions of the Personal Data over the Internet.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Third-party websites</h2>
<p>Capgemini websites may provide links to
third-party websites. Capgemini does not make any representations or warranties
with respect to such third-party websites. You should be aware that the owners
and operators of such third-party websites might collect, use or transfer
personal data under different terms and conditions than Capgemini. Upon linking
to a third-party website, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies of
such third party websites. You should also be
aware that third-party websites may use cookies.</p>
