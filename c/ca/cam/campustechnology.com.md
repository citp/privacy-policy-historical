#### Collected Information

The information we collect is gathered from several sources. These include our conferences, product subscription forms/registrations, reader service cards, website message postings, survey information and purchases via telephone, direct mail, email, and other electronic sources. From these sources we may collect postal addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and/or demographic information for those individuals that volunteer such information. For each visitor to our websites, our web server automatically recognizes the visitor’s domain name and IP address only, but no other identifiable information unless volunteered. In addition, we collect aggregate information on what web pages visitors access or visit.

#### How We Use Collected Information

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web pages, to customize the content and layout of our pages for each individual visitor, and/or to notify visitors about updates to our website. As part of a subscription and/or registration agreement, subscribers and registrants will be contacted by us through mail, e-mail, and/or phone to communicate with them about their subscription and/or registration. They will be contacted for renewal, re-qualification, surveys, updates concerning their account profile and special offers related to their subscription and/or registration. We also use the information to contact them for marketing purposes and share this information with other reputable organizations to allow them to contact our subscribers and registrants. We share both individual contact and demographic information and aggregate statistics about our members with advertisers and reputable third party vendors for marketing and promotional purposes, unless otherwise specified when the information is collected. Certain information — such as your password and credit card number — is never disclosed in any form whatsoever to any outside party.

#### E-mail Communications

If you have registered for one of our magazines, websites, events, products, or services and you have supplied an e-mail address, you may receive both transactional emails pertaining to your registration/purchase and promotional emails with valuable offers. 

Transactional emails are sent in order to maintain your account with 1105 Media Inc. You can opt-out of receiving these types of e-mails by using the opt-out mechanism located within a received e-mail message or by cancelling you subscription, registration, or purchase. 

Promotional emails are sent to bring you valuable, screened offers.

These companies may use information (not including visitors' names, addresses, email addresses, or telephone numbers) about visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to visitors.

The use of such information is governed by the privacy policy of these other companies.

#### Security

1105 Media Inc. takes every precaution to protect your information from unauthorized use. When you submit sensitive information via our websites, the information is protected both online and offline. When our registration/subscription form asks for a credit card number or other sensitive information, that information is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry — SSL.
