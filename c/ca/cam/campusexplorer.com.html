<p class="T37">The Site enables you to voluntarily provide Personal Information to third parties such as college or university admissions departments.  If you choose to submit an online loan application, we may collect information such as your Social Security Number, and that of your endorser or co-borrower, if applicable, date of birth, driver's license number, phone number, and references required for the completion of a student loan application. </p>
<h3 class="T36">Non-Personal Information</h3>
<p class="T37">We automatically collect information that does not reflect or reference an individually identifiable user to help us understand how our users use the Site. Like most websites, we automatically collect and use the data contained in log files.  The information in the log files may include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider), the Web browser you used to visit the Site, the time you visited the Site, which Web pages you visited on the Site, and other anonymous Site usage data. We call this type of information "Non-Personal Information."</p>
<h3 class="T36">Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
<p class="T37">We use cookies (a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your Web browser) and Web beacons (an electronic file placed within a Web site that monitors usage). We use cookies and Web beacons to improve the quality of the Site. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the Site may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Certain of our Service Providers (defined below) may use cookies and Web beacons in connection with the services they perform on our behalf, including, without limitation, marketing and advertising campaigns. </p>
<h3 class="T36">How we use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information</h3>
<p class="T37">We use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information for internal purposes, such as to notify you of new products or services, to send service notifications, to customize the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your requests for products and services, to improve the Site, to conduct research, to solicit your feedback and input about the Site, and to provide more relevant products, services, and advertisements on or through the Site. Personal Information and Non-Personal Information may be combined with data collected from other sources so that we may further improve the relevance of products, services, and advertisements offered on or through the Site. </p>
<p class="T37">Unless you provide us consent, information you provide to be shared with colleges, universities or lenders will not be provided by Campus Explorer to any third party other than the colleges, universities that you select or to prospective lenders, or to third parties acting on their behalf. The selected colleges, universities or lenders or such third parties acting on their behalf will be communicating with you, and their use of your data is governed by their privacy policies.  </p>
<p class="T37">From time to time, we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours ("Service Providers"). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as credit card processing, advertising, analytics tools, widget providers, data management services, Web hosting, and Web development. We provide our Service Providers with the information reasonably necessary for them to perform these services. Each Service Provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.  </p>
<p class="T37">We may use, and disclose to third parties, certain Non-Personal Information regarding the Site (e.g., number of visits, page views, number of registered members who reside in a particular geographic location, etc.). However, such information does not identify you individually.</p>
<p class="T37">We may work with third-party marketing and advertising companies including Yahoo! Inc. and Google Inc. which may use information about your visit to the Site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you on the Site and on third-party websites. From the Site, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as Web beacons or pixel tags. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party advertisement serving company may collect from you.  For more information about ad cookies and companies that provide users the ability to "opt-out" of the collection of information from such cookies, please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
<p class="T37">We may share Personal Information and Non-Personal Information with entities controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Campus Explorer. In the event that Campus Explorer is merged, sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information and Non-Personal Information in connection with such transaction.</p>
<p class="T37">In certain instances we may disclose Personal Information and Non-Personal Information when we believe it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against persons or entities in order to protect Campus Explorer or our users or when we believe that the law or legal process requires such disclosure.</p>
<h3 class="T36">Communication Tools; Public Areas</h3>
<p class="T37">If you elect to use our referral service for informing a friend about one of our Sites, Campus Explorer will automatically send your friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to view the article that you are sending them. Campus Explorer does not store this information, and it is for the sole purpose of sending the one-time e-mail. </p>
<p class="T37">Please be advised that, whenever you voluntarily post information to any community or interactive areas of the Site, such information can and may be accessed by the public. This means that any person or entity with access to such information can potentially use it for any purpose, including sending unsolicited communications.</p>
<h3 class="T36">Confidentiality and Security</h3>
<p class="T37">Information collected on or through the Site is stored on servers using encryption technology. For security in-house, security procedures are in place to prevent unauthorized access to any user information. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through the Site, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through the Site, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<h3 class="T36">Passwords</h3>
<p class="T37">There is a link available on the Campus Explorer log-in page to enable you to change your password at any time. If you forget your password, there is a link on the log-in page that will enable you to enter your Username or e-mail address with which you originally registered. When you submit this information, if your information matches what Campus Explorer has recorded for you, your username and password will be e-mailed to you. </p>
<h3 class="T36">Children's Privacy Statement</h3>
<p class="T37">We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.</p>
