This is the Privacy Policy for all Campus Explorer, Inc. websites, including the website currently located at <a href="/">www.campusexplorer.com</a> (collectively "Site" or "Sites"). For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Sites” also includes the portion of certain third party websites that consists of application forms (“Forms”) that we provide to such websites and through which we may collect information from users, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, this Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of such third party websites, other than the Forms. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, and protect Personal Information (defined below) and Non-Personal Information (defined below) when you use the Site and your choices for managing your information preferences. By using the Site, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy and the Campus Explorer <a href="/company/legal/terms/">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of June 9, 2015.</p>
<a name="Personal%20Information"></a><h3>Personal Information</h3>

<p>Campus Explorer does not collect information that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, email address, social security number and similar identifying information ("Personal Information"), unless you expressly provide it to us through one of our online services. If you choose to register on a Site in order to utilize an online service that requires you to log in, Campus Explorer may collect basic Personal Information. You may verify, correct, update, or change your registration information at any time by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@campusexplorer.com">privacy@campusexplorer.com</a> or  <a href="/panel/signin/?backref=/company/legal/privacy/">click here</a> to log in to your account.</p>
<p>The Site enables you to voluntarily provide Personal Information to third parties such as college or university admissions departments. If you choose to submit an online loan application, we may collect information such as your Social Security Number, and that of your endorser or co-borrower, if applicable, date of birth, driver's license number, phone number, and references required for the completion of a student loan application. </p>
<a name="Non-Personal%20Information"></a><h3>Non-Personal Information</h3>

<p>We automatically collect information that does not reflect or reference an individually identifiable user to help us understand how our users use the Site. Like most websites, we automatically collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files may include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider), the Web browser you used to visit the Site, the time you visited the Site, which Web pages you visited on the Site, and other anonymous Site usage data. We call this type of information "Non-Personal Information."</p>
<a name="Cookies%20and%20Web%20Beacons"></a><h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>

<p>We use cookies (a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your Web browser) and Web beacons (an electronic file placed within a Web site that monitors usage). We use cookies and Web beacons to improve the quality of the Site. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the Site may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Certain of our Service Providers (defined below) may use cookies and Web beacons in connection with the services they perform on our behalf, including, without limitation, marketing and advertising campaigns.</p>
<a name="How%20we%20use%20Personal%20Information%20and%20Non-Personal%20Information"></a><h3>How we use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information</h3>

<p>We use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information for internal purposes, such as to notify you of new or relevant products or services, to send service notifications, to customize the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your requests for products and services, to improve the Site, to conduct research, to solicit your feedback and input about the Site, and to provide more relevant products, services, and advertisements on or through the Site. Personal Information and Non-Personal Information may be combined with data collected from other sources so that we may further improve the relevance of products, services, and advertisements offered to you or on or through the Site.</p>
<p>When you request information regarding colleges, universities or lenders, we may provide your Personal Information to those colleges, universities or lenders or to third parties acting on their behalf. Unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not be provided by Campus Explorer to any third party other than the colleges, universities that you select or to prospective lenders, or to third parties acting on their behalf. The selected colleges, universities or lenders or such third parties acting on their behalf may communicate with you, and their use of your data is governed by their privacy policies.
When you provide us with your telephone number, you acknowledge that we or the selected colleges, universities or lenders or such third parties acting on their behalf may contact you at that number and may do so using an automatic telephone dialing system and/or an artificial or prerecorded voice. If you subsequently request that we not contact you at that number, we will honor your request as soon as reasonably practicable.  If your contact information has already been provided to selected colleges, universities or lenders, or such third parties acting on their behalf, then you should specifically make a request to such parties.</p>
<p>From time to time, we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours ("Service Providers"). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as credit card processing, advertising, analytics tools, widget providers, data management services, Web hosting, and Web development. We provide our Service Providers with the information reasonably necessary for them to perform these services. Each Service Provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.</p>
<p>We may use, and disclose to third parties, certain Non-Personal Information regarding the Site (e.g., number of visits, page views, number of registered members who reside in a particular geographic location, etc.). However, such information does not identify you individually.</p>
<p>We may work with third-party marketing and advertising companies including Yahoo! Inc. and Google Inc. which may use information about your visit to the Site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you on the Site and on third-party websites. From the Site, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as Web beacons or pixel tags. We may use Google Analytics and the Doubleclick cookie to serve ads based on a user’s prior visit to the Site. Users may opt out of the Doubleclick cookie by visiting  <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/">this page</a>. Users may opt out of Google Analytics by visiting  <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">this page</a>. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party advertisement serving company may collect from you.

<p>We may share Personal Information and Non-Personal Information with entities controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Campus Explorer. In the event that Campus Explorer is merged, sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information and Non-Personal Information in connection with such transaction.</p>
<p>In certain instances we may disclose Personal Information and Non-Personal Information when we believe it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against persons or entities in order to protect Campus Explorer or our users or when we believe that the law or legal process requires such disclosure.</p>
