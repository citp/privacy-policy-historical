      such as when you choose to opt-into or opt-out of the sharing of Data. We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having 
      your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information.  For example, if you 
      purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your 
      preference on our order form. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out

      to opt-out. You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service

      you review their privacy policies and remind you that we at Campusbug.com will not be responsible for their actions. In the 
      event of a transfer of ownership of Medmania, Inc., such as acquisition by or merger with another company, we will provide
