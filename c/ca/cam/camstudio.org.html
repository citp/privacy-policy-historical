<h2 class="subhead"><font size="4"><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></font></h2>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under
        the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child
        under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems.
        Camstudio.org encourages parents to go online with their
        kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer:</p>
<p>Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by
        a parent or responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school,
        etc. </p>
<p>Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate. </p>
<p>Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information
        is treated. </p>
<p>Check out the FTC's site for more tips on protecting children's privacy
        online.:</p>
