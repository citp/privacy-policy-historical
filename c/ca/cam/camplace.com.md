* * *

We collect publicly available information about you only when it is necessary to prevent fraud and illegal activities on our site (for example, when we suspect that you are using a false or stolen credit card, when we witness child abuse cases, or pedophile activity, etc.). 

This data may comprise publicly available information you share on social media like Facebook, your blog and/or site, and any other public data available on the internet. 

This information is always associated or combined with the data we collect through our site in order to finalize our investigation before reporting any fraud and illegal activities to authorities. We never use publicly available data for any other purpose. 

Camplace is an adult entertainment site and, due to the nature of our site and your activity, we may have data about you, which could reflect your sexual interests. 

When you create an account and freely indicate certain sexual preferences in order to give yourself more visibility and presence on our site, you provide us with certain information about your sexual life.

If you agreed to receive promotional emails from us, we will also send you special offers and news about our features based on your interests on our site. 

Due to the explicit meaning of each category name, as well as the types of Models/Channels (e.g. Asian girls, White Ladies, Latin Women, etc… from whom you request services), it is possible that the chosen categories reflect your sexual orientation and give us indications about your sexual life. 

We understand that this may not explicitly reflect information about your life outside of the site. It may only be a role you choose to play in the virtual environment.

######  What else do we show about you to the Models? 

* * *

As the Models/Channels are appearing on several sites at the same time (all our sites and affiliated sites), we show them from which site you are visiting from 

We show them a special icon, if you are a regular Member on a site and already purchased a certain number of tokens, so that they know that you deserve extra attention and a good service. 

######  With other users of the site and with the public 

* * *

When you initiate a private chat with a Model, only our organization and the Model/Channel can access the communications and/or images (in case you turn on your webcam) you share. Be assured that other Guests or Members of Camplace will not access any information about you from the moment you enter into a private chat. 

We use carefully selected and trusted third parties, who act as service providers to our site. 

We ensure that they are bound by contractually binding obligations to process information we share with them in accordance with our instructions, this Privacy Policy and all applicable data protection laws. 

As we constantly work on the development and enhancement of the technology to support our site, our third party service providers use may regularly change. Such entities mainly belong to the following areas: (a) business intelligence and analytics; (b) customer care; (c) marketing and sales. 

######  Payment providers and financial institutions 

* * *

When you purchase tokens your payment may be processed by a third party bank or payment processor and you may share with this party certain details, as well as payment information for the purpose of completing a transaction. 

You may receive transactional emails from this party confirming the order, including dispatch, possible refunds, and follow-up invitations to leave feedback for this party. 

If you share information with third parties directly, this Privacy Policy does not govern the processing of your personal information by these third parties. 

Be aware that if you choose the payment method "Credit/Debit card", your transaction will be handled by _Capital Financial Services S.A. located in 4C Gara Herastrau Street Bucharest, Sector 2._

When a chargeback is requested by you or by the holder of the credit card used to make the transaction, we have, in certain cases, to share some information about you and your use of the services with the processing bank. 

We may furthermore share information with relevant financial institutions, if we consider it strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention purposes. 

######  Law enforcement agencies or governmental authorities 

* * *

######  Data access and data portability 

* * *

You have the right to access the personal information that we hold about you by requesting a copy of your personal data free of charge, by contacting us and requesting it. 

Upon verification of your identity, your request will be sent to our Support Team. 

If we consider that your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive (for example, because you requested a copy of your data numerous times in a short period of time), we may refuse to act or charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs for providing you the information. 

In certain cases, you may also be entitled to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible). 

######  Rectification of inaccurate or incomplete data 

* * *

You have the right to request that we correct any inaccuracies in your personal data. 

######  Data retention and erasure

######  Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information: 

* * *

We might retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we close or suspend your account for fraud or illegal activities, we may retain certain information about you to prevent you from opening a new account in the future. Such information shall also be kept available in case of ongoing judicial proceedings and/or investigations. 

We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, we may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations. 

Some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers. 

In order to protect our site and your personal information from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, we have backup systems. Residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time. 

We process your data for a variety of reason. Applicable law may entitle you to require us not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing we will stop processing your personal data for these purposes. 

In specific situations, we may have to refuse the execution of your request. This would be the case where we have legitimate grounds to continue such processing or if we have to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. 

Please keep in mind that objecting to the use of your data might disable the use of your account. 

Please note that you may, at any time, ask us to stop sending you marketing emails. 

######  Right to restriction of processing 

* * *

You have the right to request that we hold your personal data in "limbo", while other challenges are resolved. 

Basically, you can ask us to put on hold the use of your data in 4 cases: 

· If you contest the fact that the personal data we hold about you is accurate: in this case, the processing operations in relation to this data will be put on hold for the period during which this is verified. 

· You have objected to a processing activity based on legitimate interest(s): in this case, you can require the processing operation to be put on hold while we verify the grounds for processing. 

· You consider that the processing is unlawful but you object to erasure and request restriction, instead. 

· We have no further need for the data but you require it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims. 

· Despite your request, we may still continue the processing of your personal data if we have to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims. We will notify you before lifting a restriction. 

######  Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority

If you consider that our processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR or any other applicable national laws, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, (in particular in the Member State where you live, place of work or of an alleged infringement of the GDPR). You may contact our data privacy officer via [dpo@camplace.com](mailto:dpo@camplace.com). 

######  Changes to Our Privacy Policy

If we make changes we consider important, we will let you know by placing a notice on the relevant site and/or contact you using other methods such as email.
