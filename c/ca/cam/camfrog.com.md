# Camfrog - Privacy Policy

December 26, 2009

Your privacy is important to Camfrog. Camfrog makes it a priority to respect your privacy and to protect your personal information.

## Collection and Information Usage

Camfrog collects two types of information about Camfrog users. Camfrog collects personal information that is identifiable like an individuals name or email address and non-identifiable information.

## Identifiable Information

When registering a Camfrog nickname users are asked to enter their email address and they are also given the option to enter their first and last name. This information is used to allow the user to logon to Camfrog and have access to our services. The information you enter during registration may appear in our public Camfrog user directory. Your email address is pre-checked as hidden by default so it will not appear in the directory unless you specifically allow it. You can change your identifiable profile information any time by going to your Camfrog settings. It is possible to add a photo to your profile by going to the Camfrog settings and this can also be changed or removed. During registration users are asked to input their birthday and sex. Users can also optionally add their occupation, homepage URL, and comments about themselves in their user profile settings. Your information will not be supplemented with information from other sources.

## Non-Identifiable Information

Camfrog also collects Non-Identifiable information. For example our website may keep logs of visitors Internet Browser type, Operating System, IP address and other anonymous information. Camfrog client collects your IP address, Camfrog client software version, and operating system version. Users should be aware that (1) to facilitate moderation of the room, Camfrog room owners have the transitory ability to see the IP addresses of users who join the room, and (2) both static and dynamic IP addresses can be mapped back to users on most ISPs based on the users login time and recorded information.

## Web Browser Cookies

The Camfrog website may use cookies to help keep you logged on with your nickname and password when you are using our website services. Cookies may also be used to track what Camfrog pages you visit so we can better serve you.

## Information Sharing

Camfrog does not share your personally identifiable information with third parties except in certain circumstances: 

  * If we are sent a subpoena or some other legal document or government request then we are required to comply with the law.
  * If we feel it is necessary to share information to prevent Camfrog Terms of Service violations or software piracy, fraud, or any other illegal or inappropriate activity.



## Modifying Personal Information

Go to your Camfrog settings and then choose your profile settings to modify your personal information. It is not possible to modify some non-identifiable information like your birthday and sex.

## Security Measures

Sensitive and private data exchange between the Camfrog website and Camfrog users happens over a SSL secured communication channel. All sensitive user data between the Camfrog Central server and Camfrog users is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.

Camfrog Video Chat Client software is delivered protected with a digital signature to prevent unauthorized executable changes and to protect the Camfrog installer integrity.

While Camfrog Client users store some personal information on our servers we never keep it in clean text so the data stays protected.

## Data Retention

If Camfrog is uninstalled and your nickname is not used in 1 year then your public profile information may be deleted from the public Camfrog directory. You can change your public profile any time by going to your Camfrog settings so it contains no personal identifiable information.

Camfrog will preserve your information for as long as is necessary to allow you to use Camfrog services, comply with government legislation, regulatory requests and relevant orders from relevant courts, and fulfill any of the other purposes detailed in this Privacy Statement.

## Camfrog Toolbar

Camfrog has a toolbar that is available for Internet Explorer and Firefox. Camfrog Toolbar will make Camfrog search your default search engine. To switch to any other search engine go to your browser settings. To uninstall Camfrog Toolbar go to add/remove programs.

## Uninstalling Camfrog

You may uninstall Camfrog using the Windows Add/Remove programs function.

## Children's Privacy Statement

Camfrog has created this children's privacy statement to explain our practices with respect to the online collection and use of personal information from children under the age of thirteen.  
1\. We do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally-identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen, we will delete such information from our records.  
2\. Because we do not collect any personally-identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we also do NOT knowingly distribute such information to third parties.   
3\. We do NOT knowingly allow children to participate in online activities by requiring or collecting personally-identifiable information.
