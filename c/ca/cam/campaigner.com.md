# GOT Corporation Privacy Policy

### Privacy

At GOT Corporation, we respect the privacy needs of our valued customers. If your specific questions about our Privacy Policy are not answered below, please contact us via email at [privacy@campaigner.com](mailto:privacy@campaigner.com). 

**Collection and Use of Information by GOT Corporation**  
GOT Corporation operates a Website, [http://www.campaigner.com](http://www.campaigner.cim/), and Web-based tools such as Campaigner and CampaignerPro. On the Website, GOT Corporation tracks non-personally identifiable information to help us understand our visitors' needs, as related to our web site design. While cookies are used to track a user's session, a visitors' identity is anonymous. Tracking with cookies gives GOT Corporation information about which parts of our site are used most often and what information is viewed. Cookies are not linked to anything that can personally identify a visitor, until a visitor becomes a registered user. Visitors who have provided us with registration information can be tracked during their sessions.

**Collection and Use of Customer Information**  
Through its Web-based tools, GOT Corporation explicitly asks when information that personally identifies you ('Personal Information') is needed. Your personal information is used to facilitate your access to products, and may be used by GOT Corporation to contact you while you are subscribed as a customer. Financial information that is collected is used to verify identity, and to bill either you or your company for products and services, as applicable. Profile data collected by GOT Corporation may be used to display information that is more relevant to you. GOT Corporation also compiles product use information, but in the aggregate only, and may make that aggregate information publicly available.

GOT Corporation only uses your email address to send information that you have requested. As part of your use of any GOT Corporation product, GOT Corporation allows you to elect to receive, or not receive, any information from GOT Corporation or its partners. GOT Corporation adheres strictly to its permission-based email policy. GOT Corporation will not send you commercial offers or advertisements, except as noted above.

GOT Corporation may scan the content of customers' campaigns to ensure they comply with our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20071012014656id_/http%3A//www.campaigner.com/company/termsofuse.html) \- to protect against defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, obscene, profane, or threatening material that is racially or ethnically offensive. Only a select number of GOT Corporation employees are authorized to view customer data.

**Collection and Use of Contacts' Information**  
GOT Corporation will not sell, rent, or loan our contact lists or our customer's contact lists (including customer data) to any outside firms nor will GOT Corporation use customer contact lists for its own marketing purposes. All emails that a contact has requested will have an option to unsubscribe. Unsubscribe requests are fulfilled within minutes and no further communications will be sent to contacts who have stated that they do not wish to receive the specified information. All GOT Corporation partners who offer you information via email must adhere to this unsubscribe policy.  
**  
Information Use by Third Parties**  
GOT Corporation is compliant with Canada's _Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act_ , the European Commission's _Directive on Data Protection_ , and the United States of America's _Safe Harbor_ program. GOT Corporation will only provide a customer's personal information to third parties with the customer's express written consent or in instances where such disclosure is necessary to process transactions or provide services that the customer has requested. There are two exceptions to this policy. One - if GOT Corporation is compelled to do so by an appropriately empowered governmental authority. Two - if GOT Corporation makes its technology or services available to its customers through its business partners. GOT Corporation will not share with them any more information than is necessary to perform the transaction the customer has requested. Where the customer has purchased GOT Corporation's services through a partner, GOT Corporation may provide customer name and business volume information to the partner. Such partners have agreed to use the information only in regard to analyzing the success of the partnership arrangement. GOT Corporation only does business with partners who agree to respect its Privacy Policy.
