<h3>
	How does Cambridge Audio use cookies?</h3>
<p>
	On cambridgeaudio.com, cookies record information about your online preferences, remember information about you when you visit our site and compile statistical reports on website activity. Some cookies are used that are essential in order to provide our services to you.<br>
	During the course of any visit, your navigation through the site is recorded by a cookie that is downloaded to your device. The information recorded is retrieved on a repeat visit to the site by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.<br>
	Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. Below we have set out the four categories of cookies that Cambridge Audio uses on our website. These cookies are:<br>
	<br>
	• Strictly necessary cookies<br>
	These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as using the shopping basket to continue to navigate the site when making a purchase. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, such as making a purchase using the website, cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.<br>
	<br>
	• Performance cookies<br>
	These cookies collect information about how our visitors use the website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from any web pages. They also allow us to record and count the number of visitors to the website, all of which enables us to see how visitors use the website in order to improve the way that our website works. These cookies do not collect information that identifies a visitor, as all information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how our website works.<br>
	<br>
	• Functionality cookies<br>
	These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your login details or your choices in relation to our newsletter). Whenever these cookies are used we will notify you before using the cookie, providing more information about the functionality cookie to be used, and how it might improve your user experience. The information these cookies collect is usually anonymised. They do not gather any information about you that could be used for advertising or remember where you have been on the internet.<br>
	<br>
	• Targeting cookies<br>
	These cookies collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits. They are placed by our third party service provider [although we may also place a cookie that collects this kind of information]. All of the information that these cookies collect is anonymised, although they contain a unique key that is able to distinguish, for example, individual user browsing habits, or log if an individual user has clicked on a one of our suggested recommendations. These cookies can track your visits around the website, but they do not usually know who you are. They remember that you have visited our website and your browsing habits on our website to improve your experience, so that our recommendations are a better fit for you. This information is only shared between us and our third party service provider. Without these cookies, the recommendations you encounter and user experience on our website will be less relevant to you and your interests.</p>
<h3>
	How will we use the information about you?</h3>
<p>
	We will collect information about you to process your order, manage your account and, if you agree, to email you about other products and services we think may be of interest to you.<br>

In that event we will endeavour to ensure that your rights in respect of the processing of personal data are adequately and appropriately protected.<br>
	<br>
	In processing your order, we may send your details to, and also use information from credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies.<br>
	<br>

	Cambridge Audio ensures that your personal data will not be disclosed to government institutions and authorities except if required or allowed by law.<br>
	<br>
	Please note that unless encrypted, email messages sent via the internet may not be secure and could be intercepted and read by someone else. Please bear this in mind when deciding whether to include personal or sensitive information in any email messages you intend to send.<br>
	<br>
	By submitting your information and ticking the requisite boxes on any order form or when subscribing to the services available on our website, you expressly consent to such use and transfer of that information to the extent permitted by applicable law.
