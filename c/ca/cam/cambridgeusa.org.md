##  Our Commitment to Privacy

Welcome to [CambridgeUSA.org](http://cambridgeusa.org/)—the Official Tourism Web site for Cambridge, MA.

##  Our Collection and Use of Your Personally Identifiable Information

In general, we collect and use information about you where we reasonably believe it will help us administer our services generally, and improve our response to your requests for tourism and vacation information for the City.

##  Links to Third Party Web Sites

There are a few sections on the COFT Web site that are hosted by various partners of our office. These sites maintain the look and feel of our Web site, and sometimes it may not be evident when a user is on one of these sections. These pages are governed by the partner’s privacy policy and terms and conditions of use. Below is a list of our partners and links to their Web site privacy policies:

  * Fulfillment America When you click on Request a Visitor Guide, you will be transferred to Fulfillment America, our Visitor Guide distribution partner. It will appear as if you are still on our Web site. However, this section is controlled and operated by Fulfillment America, Inc. Please review their [privacy policy](http://www.wctravel.com/corp/privacyStatement.html) for any and all transactions via the online collateral fulfillment system.



COFT is also not responsible for the content or privacy policies of other Web sites to which it provides links. Please review the privacy policies and/or the terms and conditions of each of these additional linked Web sites before providing any personal information.

We are committed to providing a comprehensive Web site regarding Cambridge area events and attractions. However, we do not and will not link to sites with adult content.

##  Contests & Sweepstakes

On occasion, COFT will conduct online contests, giveaways, or sweepstakes, which require information to be provided for eligibility. The information collected in these contests is subject to our Privacy Policy and Conditions of Use and is not shared. However, if the user does not provide the requested information he/she may not be eligible for the contest. The information submitted is entered into a random drawing of the names to determine the winner. The entrant may choose to receive continued e-mails from COFT. If the entrant does not choose to receive e-mail, the information submitted by the entrant is deleted from the database after the contest has ended.

##  Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy
