	Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
<p>
	Welcome to <a href="http://CambridgeUSA.org">CambridgeUSA.org</a>—the Official Tourism Web site for Cambridge, MA. This site is owned and operated by the Cambridge Office for Tourism (collectively referred to herein as “COFT,” “us” or “we”). Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.</p>
<h2>
	Our Collection and Use of Your Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<p>
	In general, we collect and use information about you where we reasonably believe it will help us administer our services generally, and improve our response to your requests for tourism and vacation information for the City. The information you give us also allows us to statistically analyze the usage of our Web site (also referred to herein as “Site”), improve our content and informational offerings, and customize our Site’s content, layout and services. Except as described herein, we do not sell, rent or otherwise share or disclose your private, personally identifiable information to third parties.</p>
<h2>
	We specifically collect information from you at several different points, including but not limited to the following:</h2>
<h2>
	Information You Provide To Us</h2>
<p>
	You provide information when you post and submit information through the sections that request information (such as the Contact Us, Newsletter Sign-up, or Pressroom sections), or when you participate in a contest or questionnaire. For example, you provide information when you ask a question, request the Visitor Guide, sign up for access to the Pressroom, complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form. When this information is submitted, your contact information is automatically added to our database of users. This database is used for correspondence that may be sent to you only from within the COFT organization or its designated fulfillment house. You may opt-out of inclusion in the database by sending us an opt-out request via Email: <a href="mailto:info@cambridge-usa.org">info@cambridge-usa.org</a></p>
<h2>

	<br>

<h2>
	Restrictions on Disclosing Information To Third Parties</h2>
<p>
	Except as described herein, we do not sell, rent or otherwise share or disclose your private, personally identifiable information to third parties unless: (1) you request or authorize it; (2) the information is provided to help provide a service or complete a transaction with you; (3) the information is provided to comply with the law (for example, to comply with a search warrant, subpoena or court order), enforce an agreement we have with you, or to protect our rights, property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of our employees or others; (4) the information is provided to our agents, vendors or service providers who perform functions on our behalf (and who are all contractually bound to maintain the confidentiality of the information); (5) to address emergencies or acts of God; or (6) to address disputes, claims, or to persons holding a legal or beneficial interest. We may also gather aggregated data about our visitors and disclose the results of such aggregated (but not personally identifiable) information to our partners, service providers and/or other third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.</p>
<h2>
	Links to Third Party Web Sites</h2>
<p>
	There are a few sections on the COFT Web site that are hosted by various partners of our office. These sites maintain the look and feel of our Web site, and sometimes it may not be evident when a user is on one of these sections. These pages are governed by the partner’s privacy policy and terms and conditions of use. Below is a list of our partners and links to their Web site privacy policies:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Fulfillment America When you click on Request a Visitor Guide, you will be transferred to Fulfillment America, our Visitor Guide distribution partner. It will appear as if you are still on our Web site. However, this section is controlled and operated by Fulfillment America, Inc. Please review their <a href="http://www.wctravel.com/corp/privacyStatement.html" target="_blank">privacy policy</a> for any and all transactions via the online collateral fulfillment system.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<br>
	COFT is also not responsible for the content or privacy policies of other Web sites to which it provides links. Please review the privacy policies and/or the terms and conditions of each of these additional linked Web sites before providing any personal information.<br>
	<br>
	We are committed to providing a comprehensive Web site regarding Cambridge area events and attractions. However, we do not and will not link to sites with adult content.</p>
<h2>
	Contests &amp; Sweepstakes</h2>
<p>
	On occasion, COFT will conduct online contests, giveaways, or sweepstakes, which require information to be provided for eligibility. The information collected in these contests is subject to our Privacy Policy and Conditions of Use and is not shared. However, if the user does not provide the requested information he/she may not be eligible for the contest. The information submitted is entered into a random drawing of the names to determine the winner. The entrant may choose to receive continued e-mails from COFT. If the entrant does not choose to receive e-mail, the information submitted by the entrant is deleted from the database after the contest has ended.</p>
<h2>
	Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
	Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we do not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children that we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.<br>
	<br>
	Disclaimer and Release With Respect to Transactions Entered Into With Any Linked Site or Other Third Party<br>
	Any transaction that you enter into with any linked site, or other third party via or as a result of viewing our Web site is solely between you and such linked site or other third party.

For more information about charge-back rights, contact the financial institution that issued the credit card used for the transaction.</p>
