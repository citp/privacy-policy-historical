# CampDoc.com | Privacy Policy

  * #### Your Privacy and Security is our Top Priority

While it is necessary for us to collect personal information that you provide us, we respect and protect your right to privacy. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. The following is CampDoc's policy regarding your privacy and the security of your personal information.

    * We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our database to be only accessed by those authorized with special access rights to our systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. 
    * CampDoc LLC uses your personal information to personalize your experience, improve customer service and promote safer and more efficient communication between parents and camps. 
    * CampDoc LLC may use non-personally identifiable aggregated data in order to better understand how our site is being use and to enhance the experience of all visitors to our site. 
    * You are always able to review and edit your registration information from our site at any time.   


#### How Your Information is Protected

CampDoc LLC is committed to protecting all of the personal information you supply us. CampDoc LLC follows reasonable technical and management practices to aid in protecting the security, confidentiality and integrity of the data stored on our systems. Our site uses Verisign secure socket layer (SSL) technology to encrypt your personal information. This provides for the secure transmission of the information from your computer to our servers. CampDoc LLC does a thorough background check on all of its employees and only employees that need access to your information in order to perform their jobs are allowed such access. All CampDoc LLC employees are informed about their responsibility to protect our customers privacy and we give them clear guidelines for adhering to our own business ethics standards and confidentiality policies. Any employees who violate our privacy and/or security policies will be subject to disciplinary action, and if the violation warrants, they will be terminated and may be charged with civil and or criminal prosecution.

#### HIPAA

Unlike your child's pediatrician, CampDoc LLC is not regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), a federal law that establishes confidentiality standards for patient health information. This is because CampDoc LLC does not store data on behalf of health care providers. Instead, our primary relationship is with you and your child's camp organization. However, even though CampDoc LLC is not covered by HIPAA, we are still fully committed to protecting your privacy.

#### Information Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

#### Cookies

A "cookie" is a small file that is stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies allow us to recognize who you are when you navigate through our site, and assist us in personalizing your experience. At no time is your personally identifiable information stored within a cookie.

#### California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

Because we value your privacy we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent. As part of the California Online Privacy Protection Act, all users of our site may make any changes to their information at anytime by emailing info@campdoc.com with the necessary changes.
