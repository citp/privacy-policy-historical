# The Camping and Caravanning Club - Privacy Policy

## The Camping and Caravanning Club respects your right to privacy. In the statement below you will find full details of how the Club protects and secures your personal information. 

## What information do we collect? 

The Club website collects such information as the IP address (location of your computer on the internet), what pages were accessed and file downloads from the site. Monitoring of such information helps the Club determine the activity on the website and which pages are most popular. This information is used to develop and improve our services online to Club members. Additionally, in the event of a breach of security this information may be used to aid detection. 

## What data do we collect? 

Within our website there are certain areas which require you to submit personal information within a form, such as joining online, requesting information such as a brochure or making an enquiry. These are necessary to allow us to service your membership. This information may include name, address, telephone number, email address, country of residence and your age. In addition when joining or renewing your membership or booking sites online we will need to know your Credit or Debit Card details and expiry date, along with issue number (for Switch only).

## How is personal data secured? 

All data gathered is processed through a 'Secure Server'. All of our forms, in particular those which request credit card or bank details use the SSL (secure sockets layer) protocol for encryption. Most browsers (including current versions of Microsoft Explorer and Netscape Navigator) support SSL. The link between your browser and the server is secure if your browser displays a small padlock or key symbol somewhere in the frame, or the address bar shows a web address beginning 'https://' (rather than http://). Additionally, you can check the SSL licence is relevant and current by simply clicking on the padlock symbol. 

## How do we use your data? 

The Club will use the information you provide to us in order to: 

  * process your new membership applications and renewals submitted to us 
  * process your site bookings 
  * supply information requested through the website, such as brochures 
  * verify financial transactions 
  * investigate and resolve any problems with any services supplied to you 
  * improve the content of our web pages 
  * carry out research on our visitors in order to improve the service offered to you 



The Club will also use this information to service your membership including providing you with your monthly magazine. We may also occasionally wish to use this data to send you information which may be of interest to you. This will only come from us or our dedicated Member Service providers. Any correspondence you receive will also give you the opportunity to opt-out at any point if you would prefer not to continue receiving information. 

## Does the Club share personal details?
