The types of personal information we collect include name, contact details, identification information, organisation, title, information submitted in forms, payment details and enquiry/complaint details.

We collect personal information directly from you as well as from third parties including public sources, our related companies, information service providers and the parties with whom we exchange information as described here.

We also store and manage information on behalf of our customers so they can manage their email campaigns. This includes information about our customers’ subscribers such as email addresses, emails received, links accessed (we sometimes track this for customers through our software) and other details entered by customers into our systems, which are subject to our Terms of Use but are not otherwise limited or controlled by us. It is possible that in this respect we could handle sensitive information such as information about professional association membership, political beliefs, health and religion. We do not use this information for our own purposes.

We collect, use and disclose your personal information to provide, administer, improve and personalise our products and services, maintain and update our records, manage our relationship with you and our customers and deal with your enquiries and concerns. We may also collect, use and disclose your personal information in connection with suspected fraud, misconduct and unlawful activity.

If you are our customer, your personal information is used to create your personal access to our email marketing product, and to contact you in the course of using this product. Financial information that is collected is used to verify, identity and to bill either you or your company for products and services, as applicable. Demographic and profile data collected by Campaign Monitor may be used to tailor this web site or any requested email communications, and to display information that is more relevant to you. Campaign Monitor also compiles demographic and product use information, but in the aggregate only, and may make that aggregate information publicly available. Under no circumstances will Campaign Monitor make any personal information about an individual user available publicly in this manner.

Your email address is used to only send you information that you have requested. As part of your use of our email marketing software, Campaign Monitor allows you to elect to receive, or not receive, certain information from Campaign Monitor. Campaign Monitor adheres strictly to permission-based email policy. Except as mentioned above, Campaign Monitor will not send you unsolicited email information, commercial offers or advertisements.

All emails that you have requested will have an option to unsubscribe. Unsubscribe requests are fulfilled within minutes and no further communications will be sent to users who have stated that they do not wish to receive the specified information.
