The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * the countries we transfer your personal data to have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;
  * we use contractual clauses approved by the European Commission which give personal data similar protection to that which it has in the EEA; or
  * where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data that applies within the EEA.



Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
