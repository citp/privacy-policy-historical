This page explains what personal information we gather when you visit the University’s central website ([www.cam.ac.uk](http://www.cam.ac.uk/)) and details how that information is used.

The information published here applies to the use of your personal information (also known as ‘personal data’) by the University of Cambridge through the viewing or use of its core website ([www.cam.ac.uk](http://www.cam.ac.uk/)) or any website within the University of Cambridge domain which has pointed you to this page. Each of the 31 Colleges of the University is a separate legal entity for these purposes and each College website will supply you with its own information.  The information published here is limited to the use of personal information by University websites; various other notices are published in relation to our use of the personal information of applicants, students, staff, alumni, research participants, and others.

When you visit [www.cam.ac.uk](http://www.cam.ac.uk/) we use a third party service, Google Analytics, to collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site. For information about how Google Analytics uses your personal information, please see <http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/> and <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245>.

We use the Disqus service to allow you to comment on articles. For information about how Disqus uses your personal information, please see <https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy>.

We also collect the request made by your browser to the server hosting the website which includes the IP address, the date and time of connection and the page you ask for. We use this information to ensure the security of our websites and we delete it after a maximum of 3 months. We may use and disclose it as necessary in the event of a security concern or incident.

For information about how we use cookies on our websites, please see [http://www.cam.ac.uk/about-this-site/cookies](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-this-site/cookies).

The use of your personal information in the above ways is necessary for the legitimate interests of the University in operating and improving its websites, analysing their use, and ensuring their security. Our websites collect very little personal information and we use it in ways that are compatible with your individual rights and freedoms.  Where you enter your personal information into an online form on any of our websites for any specified purpose, you will be told about the use we will make of that information (e.g. to send you newsletters or to enable your attendance at an event).
