##  Data collected

In common with most web sites, this site automatically logs certain information about every request made of it (see below for more details).

##  Logged data

The following data is automatically collected for each request:

  * The name or network address of the computer making the request. Note that under some (but not all) circumstances it may be possible to infer from this the identity of the person making the request. Note also that the data recorded may be that of a web proxy rather than that of the originating client
  * The username, when known during authenticated (logged in) access to the site
  * The date and time of connection
  * The HTTP request, which contains the identification of the document requested
  * The status code of the request (success or failure etc.)
  * The number of data bytes sent in response
  * The contents of the HTTP Referrer header supplied by the browser
  * The content of the HTTP User-Agent header supplied by the browser



Logging of additional data may be enabled temporarily from time to time for specific purposes.

In addition, the computers on which the web site is hosted keep records of attempts (authorised and unauthorised) to use them for purposes other than access to the web server. This data typically includes:

  * the date and time of the attempt,
  * the service to which access was attempted,
  * the name or network address of the computer making the connection,
  * and may include details of what was done or was attempted to be done.
