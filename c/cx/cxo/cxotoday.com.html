					<p>As most websites do, however, we do track usage patterns on an anonymous basis. Your identity cannot reasonably be ascertained from this information. Each time you visit our site, our server records your Internet Service Provider, the date and time of your visit, the pages you visit and the documents downloaded, the searches you performed, and the referring URLs you came from. We use this non-personal information to optimize our service.</p>
					<p>For your convenience, we may offer links from our site to other websites. However, <b>Trivone Digital Services Pvt Ltd</b> is not responsible for, nor do we accept any liability for, the personal information collection, use and disclosure practices of other entities to which our site may link. You should consult the privacy policies of these other entities before providing any personal information on their sites.</p>
					<p><b>Your Consent -</b> We collect, use and disclose your personal information with your consent or as permitted or required by law. Your consent may be express or implied, depending on the circumstances and the sensitivity of the personal information in question. If you provide personal information about another person to us, we assume you have the consent of that individual to enable us to collect, use or disclose their information as described in this policy.

					<p><b>Security - Trivone Digital Services Pvt Ltd</b> has implemented reasonable physical, organizational and technological security measures to safeguard the personal information in our custody or control. These include safeguards to protect personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.</p>
					<p><b>Changes To This Statement - Trivone Digital Services Pvt Ltd</b> reserves the right to change this privacy statement at any time and we will take reasonable steps to advise affected individuals of any material changes, if necessary. However, you should review this privacy statement from time to time to ensure that you are aware of and accept any changes made. You may <a href="http://www.techtree.com/content/contact-us.html" target="_blank">contact us</a> here to obtain a current copy of this privacy statement.</p>
					<p><b>Registration -</b> No registration is required to view the <b>Cxotoday.com</b> website. However, if you choose to register or provide personal information on our newsletter sign-up, feedback forms, affiliate, partner and job application pages or other areas of our site, we will ask for information which may include your name, email address, company name, and phone number.</p>
					<p><b>Email Alerts -</b> If a user wishes to subscribe to our alerts, updates, briefings etc, we ask for contact and delivery information such as name and e-mail address. All of these e-mail lists provide opt-out facilities online and with each e-mail broadcast. In some cases, the user is asked to provide optional demographic and personal interest information that is used to keep our content as relevant as possible.</p>
					<p><b>Sharing -</b> We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p>
					<p><b>Cookies -</b> A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of cookies is for the convenience of visitors. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user does not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users in order to enhance the experience on our site. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to, or control over, these cookies.  Third party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites on the internet and use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to this website. You may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/" target="_blank">Google advertising opt-out page.</a></p>

					<p><b>Site And Service Updates -</b> We also send the user site and service announcement updates.
