**Our Commitment to Data Security**

To maintain the accuracy of all Data, as well as to prevent unauthorized access and to ensure the correct use of the Data, we have carried out appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures to safeguard and secure the Data we collect online. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol - an industry standard for encryption over the Internet that protects Data. When you type in sensitive information such as credit card details, it will be automatically converted into code before being securely dispatched over the Internet.

The Data you provide us will be stored in a database for the length of your membership or registration validity, whichever is longer, after which it will be destroyed. The website has a firewall in place, which aim to protect Data collected from you against unauthorized or accidental access. However, complete confidentiality and security is not yet possible over the Internet, and we cannot assure complete privacy during any communication between you and us.

You should understand that personal information is disclosed at your own risk, and may be subject to unauthorized use by others. This may result in you receiving unsolicited messages from other parties. We are not responsible in any manner for direct, indirect, special or consequential damages, howsoever caused, arising from the communication of information to us.
