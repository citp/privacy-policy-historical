We will never use or share the Data provided to us online in ways unrelated to the purposes aforementioned.

**Our Commitment to Data Security**

To maintain the accuracy of all Data, as well as to prevent unauthorized access and to ensure the correct use of the Data, we have carried out appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures to safeguard and secure the Data we collect online. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol - an industry standard for encryption over the Internet that protects Data. When you type in sensitive information such as credit card details, it will be automatically converted into code before being securely dispatched over the Internet.

The Data you provide us will be stored in a database for the length of your membership or registration validity, whichever is longer, after which it will be destroyed. The website has a firewall in place, which aim to protect Data collected from you against unauthorized or accidental access. However, complete confidentiality and security is not yet possible over the Internet, and we cannot assure complete privacy during any communication between you and us.

You should understand that personal information is disclosed at your own risk, and may be subject to unauthorized use by others. This may result in you receiving unsolicited messages from other parties. We are not responsible in any manner for direct, indirect, special or consequential damages, howsoever caused, arising from the communication of information to us.

We may occasionally send you email updates about our latest products and services, as well as special offers.

Should you prefer not to receive any email updates from us, feel free to opt out from these services by contacting us directly. Alternatively, simply replying to our email with a short note e.g. "Please do not send me email updates about your latest news and offers".

Protecting the privacy of children is our primary concern. Therefore, we make every effort to desist from collecting Data from our website or storing this Data from those who are under 13 years of age.
