### EU - US Safe Harbor Privacy Statement

**A Message to our Clients About EU-US Safe Harbor**  
The October 2015 ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) invalidating the long-standing Safe Harbor data protection framework between the US and the European Union (EU) has created uncertainty for companies in all industries. This communication is intended to summarize the relevant facts, explain the impact of the court's ruling on CSC, and highlight CSC's approach to privacy and data protection compliance. 

**Facts**

  * The Safe Harbor data protection framework was long ago agreed by the European Commission and the US Federal Trade Commission as a means to streamline and legitimize data transfers that international companies make between the US and EU member states. CSC began to certify Safe Harbor compliance in 2014 as an additional means to comply with the EU Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data.
  * On October 6, 2015 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled "Safe Harbor" to be invalid.
  * Advocates expect after a brief transition period, the national supervisory authorities will suspend personal data transfers that are legitimized on the basis of Safe Harbor alone.



**Implications for CSC Clients**

  * CSC is well-positioned to carry on in compliance with EU and member state privacy and data protection law despite the recent Court ruling that invalidated the Safe Harbor framework.
  * Safe Harbor compliance is only one of several strategies companies like CSC may choose to comply with EU and member state data protection laws. Companies may legitimize personal data transfers between US-EU by: 
    * Executing data transfer agreements which contain standard data protection contract terms required by EU law
    * Implementing a system of "binding corporate rules" that are approved by EU and other data protection authorities
    * Obtaining an individual's informed and freely given consent to a personal data transfer.
  * Since long before CSC began in 2014 to certify compliance with the Safe Harbor framework, our strategy has been to execute and maintain data transfer agreements to legitimize our US-EU data transfers. These data transfer agreements continue in force today as the primary means by which CSC's transfer of personal data between the US and the European Union complies with EU privacy law. Our Safe Harbor certification has offered only supplemental assurances to clients who may have expected or required it.
  * CSC's Privacy and Data Protection Office has determined that all client personal data transfers which are necessary for CSC to deliver its Cloud, Cybersecurity, Big Data, Applications, and Mobility services comply with EU and member state privacy legislation.
  * The personal data of CSC clients and of client's customers located within the EU/Switzerland are today transferred solely in accordance with legally-valid data transfer agreements that incorporate the EU's standard contractual clauses.
  * As always, CSC's Global Privacy and Data Protection Office continues to liaise with the relevant national data protection authorities and confer with our legal advisors in order to monitor and prepare the business for any additional changes in the privacy and data protection legal and regulatory landscape.



**Privacy and Data Protection at CSC**  
At CSC our commitment to privacy goes beyond the minimum legal and regulatory requirements. We strive for "best in class" data protection and privacy management, which requires a sound data privacy governance structure and an effective data privacy compliance and best practices program to ensure CSC meets ever-changing and increasingly-complex regulatory standards and all contractually agreed privacy obligations.  
CSC's Global Privacy and Data Protection Office has strategic and operational responsibility for this program, which is adequately resourced and appropriately organized to ensure the policies and compliance processes, technology and physical controls and security we rely upon to govern the collection, use, and transfer of personal data all over the world meets statutory and regulatory requirements. Therefore, CSC's approach is to coordinate the contribution of several corporate disciplines - including ethics and compliance, legal, human resources, and information security - to achieve our "best in class" data protection and privacy management objectives. Highlights of this approach include:

  * Strong board and executive management commitment to CSC's CLEAR Values and a culture of compliance with policy and the law. 
    * Our CLEAR Values are the distinguishing hallmarks of CSC's performance and reputation. They inform our decisions and drive personal responsibility. CSC's CLEAR Values define a culture in which the way we achieve our objectives matters as much, if not more, than our results.
  * CSC's Global Privacy and Data Protection Office (PDPO). 
    * Based in Germany, CSC's global PDPO is a well-resourced and qualified strategic compliance function that operates under the authority of CSC's global Ethics and Compliance Office.
    * The PDPO is responsible and accountable to advise CSC's businesses on best practices in privacy compliance, and to develop policies, procedures, training, and risk assessment and monitoring programs that enable CSC to provide adequate levels of personal data protection for its clients and employees in all geographies and jurisdictions the world over.
  * Compliance Policies, Standards, and Processes 
    * A strong, globally-applicable Privacy and Data Protection Policy which reflects the Generally Accepted Privacy Principles ("GAPP") applicable to the collection, use, and processing of personal data.
    * Comprehensive and cohesive compliance standards, processes, and procedures, which ensure consistent privacy and data protection across all of CSC's legal entities and businesses.
  * Employee Training and Awareness 
    * CSC takes a holistic approach to ensure privacy-aware employees throughout the employment lifecycle including new-hire instructions, annual awareness briefings, targeted training for high-risk populations, and periodic awareness messaging through newsletters and PDPO bulletins.
  * Strong Risk Management Programs 
    * In light of the inherent exposures to CSC's operational and strategic goals, the company is committed to ensuring that risk, issue, and opportunity management (RIOM) is a core competency, and an integral part of CSC's business operations that supports and informs everyday decision making.
    * The resources in both the Ethics and Compliance Office and its Privacy and Data Protection Office are integral parts of CSC's overall risk assessment program and posture, which includes internal and external audit and monitoring functions.
    * With regular privacy risk assessments, the PDPO monitors emerging exposures and remediates weaknesses in an effort to constantly mature CSC's compliance capabilities.
    * A consistent Privacy Impact Assessment program is carried out on new and changed services, systems, and processes, aiming to disclose potential issues before they become a problem.
    * Formal data breach handling procedures and a robust 24/7 operated incident response center supplement regulatory and contractual notification requirements, enabling constant vigilance and readiness in case of a crisis.
  * Strong, Collaborative Cross-Disciplinary Partnerships 
    * Inclusive of key internal stakeholders, including information and physical security, legal, human resources, and key business unit personnel without whom strict compliance with privacy laws is not possible.
  * Flexible Service Delivery Model 
    * A strong and robust global service delivery model that is flexible enough to meet the privacy requirements of the highly sensitive, regulated, and classified data environments.
  * Formal Dispute Resolution Mechanism 
    * A one-stop point of contact for our employees and clients for any privacy related matters regardless of the geography, business, or service including an independent external resource to resolve any privacy related disputes.
