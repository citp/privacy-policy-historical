This Policy does not apply to information collected offline or via online sources other than www.csc.com. We invite you to visit the Site to search or browse without revealing personal information or registering with CSC, however, as we gather information about your usage or as you may choose to give CSC personal information via the Site, it is CSC’s intent to let you know how CSC will use such information. If you tell CSC that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, CSC will endeavor to respect your wishes.

CSC reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Be sure to check this page periodically for updates.

### Registration

Registration is not required to gain access to the Site. However, there are sections of the Site which do require a password, such as the Health Services and Financial Services sub sites.

### Usage Statistics

Whether you register or not, when you visit the Site, some information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, Internet service provider, operating system, the service from which you arrived, the page you requested, the time and date of your visit, and potentially other site usage statistics will be collected automatically as part of the software processes of the Web page. This information itself does not personally identify you, but could potentially be linked with personal information that you provide CSC. These statistics allow CSC to analyze the effectiveness of its Site, make improvements where needed and potentially to market CSC’s products and services to you. Generally, this information is kept as long as required to support the improvements of the Site and could be shared with our advisors, agents or other third parties.

### Cookies

### Personal Information

Any time CSC collects information that you voluntarily submit, it is CSC's intent to inform you why this information is being requested, how it is going to be used and to whom it may be disclosed. CSC may collect personal information from you including your name, phone number, Email address, or other information you choose to provide at various times, for example, when you complete an online form or request or participate in an online community. CSC uses the personal information it collects at this Site and from other sources to process your requests, provide online services, inform you of opportunities that CSC believes you might find interesting, and to understand your needs so that CSC can provide you with the highest quality of service. 

CSC has put safeguards in place to protect the security of the personal information you submit to this Site. For example, CSC requires its vendors to comply with CSC’s security policies. Likewise, our periodic deletion of data submitted to www.csc.com must comply with CSC’s security and document retention and disposal policies.

### Disclosures to Third Parties

CSC does not sell or rent your personal information to any third party, and will not do so without your knowledge and consent. CSC frequently uses the services of outside vendors, agents and advisors. We require these third parties to respect our privacy practices and not use your personal information for purposes other than to carry out our instructions. CSC potentially could be compelled by applicable law to disclose personal information to government authorities or other third parties. CSC reserves the right to disclose personal information as necessary in an apparent emergency; as an asset in any sale to a third party of our company or a portion of its assets; or as necessary in order to mount a legal claim or defense.

### External Links

CSC is not liable for any personal information that you submit to third parties or to any Web site linked to this Site.

### Resume Collection

The Site provides a capability for Users to submit their resumes to CSC via email.

### Children

This Site is intended for adult use only. It is not intended for children, and CSC asks that minors not submit any personal information. 

### Global Nature of CSC

It is CSC's intent to safeguard any personal information that you submit, and CSC will continue to take steps to maintain the security of this Site. However, as a multinational corporation, the data we collect may be internationally distributed throughout CSC, and the open nature of the Internet is such that data may flow over networks without security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended. Further, your personal information could reside in countries with privacy and data protection laws that are different from those in your home jurisdiction. Therefore, in submitting personal information to the Site, you assume the risk of a third party obtaining that information.

Certain features and services of www.csc.com – especially highly interactive features – may involve types of personal information and data handling that are not specifically discussed here in this general www.csc.com Privacy Policy. Rest assured that this general policy applies wherever you go within www.csc.com. We may, however, provide additional privacy information at a particular feature or service so you can be better informed about CSC’s practices, including how that service may be collecting and using your personal information and opportunities you may have to access and correct your information.
