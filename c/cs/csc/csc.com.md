# Privacy Policy | DXC Technology

## Enterprise Online Privacy Statement

### PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION AT DXC

This policy has been updated to protect personal data in accordance with requirements set forth in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect on May 25, 2018. 

At DXC our commitment to privacy goes beyond the minimum legal and regulatory requirements. We strive for best-in-class data protection and privacy management, which requires a sound data privacy governance structure and an effective data privacy compliance and best practices program to ensure DXC meets ever-changing and increasingly-complex regulatory standards and all contractually agreed privacy obligations. 

DXC's Global Privacy and Data Protection Office has strategic and operational responsibility for this program, which is adequately resourced and appropriately organized to ensure the policies and compliance processes, technology and physical controls and security we rely upon to govern the collection, use, storage and transfer of personal data all over the world meets statutory and regulatory requirements. Therefore, DXC's approach is to coordinate the contribution of several corporate disciplines - including ethics and compliance, legal, human resources, and information and physical security - to achieve our "best in class" data protection and privacy management objectives. 

Strong board and executive management commitment to DXC's CLEAR Values and a culture of compliance with policy and the law. 

  1. Our CLEAR Values are the distinguishing hallmarks of DXC's performance and reputation. They inform our decisions and drive personal responsibility. DXC's CLEAR Values define a culture in which the way we achieve our objectives matters as much, if not more, than our results. 



DXC’s Ethics and Compliance Office (ECO) 

  1. ECO’s Charter and responsibilities are evidenced by Board resolution, which assigns day-to-day management responsibility for DXC’s ethics and compliance program to a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. 
  2. The ECO Mission: Promote throughout the global DXC Technology community a culture of performance with integrity that encourages ethical conduct, reinforces the CLEAR Values, and drives compliance with the Code of Business Conduct, internal policies, and the law. 



DXC's Global Privacy and Data Protection Office (PDPO). 

  1. Based in the European Union (EU), DXC's global PDPO is a well-resourced and qualified strategic compliance function that operates under the authority of DXC's global Ethics and Compliance Office. 
  2. The PDPO is responsible and accountable to advise DXC's businesses on best practices in privacy compliance, and to develop policies, procedures, training, risk assessment and monitoring programs that enable DXC to provide adequate levels of personal data protection for its clients, employees and other relevant individuals in all geographies and jurisdictions the world over. 



Compliance Policies, Standards, and Processes. 

  1. A strong, globally-applicable Privacy and Data Protection Policy which reflects the Generally Accepted Privacy Principles ("GAPP") applicable to the collection, use, storage, and processing of personal data. 
  2. Comprehensive and cohesive compliance standards, processes, and procedures, which ensure consistent privacy and data protection across all of DXC's legal entities and businesses. 



Employee Training and Awareness 

  1. DXC takes a holistic approach to ensure privacy-aware employees throughout the employment lifecycle including new-hire instructions, annual awareness briefings, targeted training for high-risk populations, and periodic awareness messaging through newsletters and PDPO bulletins. 



Strong Risk Management Programs 

  1. In light of the inherent exposures to DXC's operational and strategic goals, DXC is committed to ensuring that risk, issue, and opportunity management is a core competency, and an integral part of DXC's business operations that supports and informs reliable, quality decision making. 
  2. The resources in both the Ethics and Compliance Office and its Privacy and Data Protection Office are integral parts of DXC's overall risk assessment program and posture, which includes internal and external audit and monitoring functions. 
  3. With regular privacy risk assessments, the PDPO monitors emerging exposures and remediates weaknesses in an effort to constantly mature DXC's compliance capabilities. 



A consistent Privacy Impact Assessment program is carried out on new and changed services, systems, and processes, aiming to disclose potential issues before they become a problem. 

Formal data breach handling procedures and a robust 24/7 operated incident response center supplement regulatory and contractual notification requirements, enabling constant vigilance and readiness in case of a crisis. 

Strong, Collaborative Cross-Disciplinary Partnerships 

  1. Inclusive of key internal stakeholders, including strong collaborative ties to DXC’s information and physical security, legal, human resources, and key business unit personnel without whom strict compliance with privacy laws is not possible. 



Flexible Service Delivery Model 

  1. A strong and robust global service delivery model that is flexible enough to meet the privacy requirements of the highly sensitive, regulated, and classified data environments. 



Formal Dispute Resolution Mechanism 

  1. A one-stop point of contact for our employees and clients for any privacy related matters regardless of the geography, business, or service. If you have specific concerns or requests, please feel free to send an email to [ privacy@dxc.com ](mailto:privacy@dxc.com). 



This Privacy Statement applies to all DXC-owned websites, domains, and services and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries ("DXC sites or services"), except that a privacy policy or statement specific to a particular DXC service or program may supersede or supplement this Privacy Statement. Personal information concerning DXC and its customers, including outsourcing and other services clients, business partners, employees, former employees, and applicants for employment (“covered individuals”) collected and processed offline is also governed by this Privacy Statement except where the contract with a covered individual defines different requirements which will take precedence over this Privacy Statement. 

Personal information is any information that personally identifies an individual or from which an individual could be identified.  This may include a name, address, telephone number, email address and other private personal attributes.

Such processing is done in compliance with applicable laws, including appropriate notice and consent, along with required filings with data protection authorities, where required. 

DXC may collect and process personal information through a variety of means, including, as examples, access to DXC sites or services, or other ordering channels, employment processes, during conversations or correspondence with DXC representatives, through purchase of goods or services or in the course of an online application. 

Fulfilling your Transaction Request 

If we receive any requests related to, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use your personal information to fulfill your request. In this context, we may share information with others, for instance, DXC's group companies and business partners, involved in fulfillment. In connection with a transaction, we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes subject to applicable laws and regulations.

Monitoring or Recording of Calls, Chats and Other Interactions 

Certain online transactions may involve you calling us or us calling you. They may also involve online chats. Please be aware that it is DXC's general practice to monitor and in some cases record such interactions for staff training or quality assurance purposes or to retain evidence of a particular transaction or interaction. 

Mobile Applications and Use of Information in the Social Computing Environment 

DXC makes available mobile applications for download from various mobile application marketplaces. DXC also provides social computing tools on some of its websites to enable collaboration among members who have registered to use them. These include forums, wikis, blogs and other social media platforms. 

When downloading and using these applications or registering to use these social computing tools, you may be asked to provide certain personal information. These applications and tools may also include supplemental privacy statements with specific information about collection and handling practices. We encourage you to read those supplemental statements to understand how the tools and applications may process your data.

Protect the Rights and Property 

We may also use or share your information to protect the rights or property of DXC, our business partners, suppliers, clients, or others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, or the rights of others, or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, law enforcement or legal process. 

DXC will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others except as described in this Privacy Statement. 

As a global organization with business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders, DXC may share information about you within DXC and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business in connection with the uses identified above and in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Our Privacy Statement and our internal policies and practices are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for personal information all over the world. Even in countries whose laws provide for less protection for your information, DXC will still handle and protect your information in the manner described in this Privacy Statement. 

DXC retains service providers, suppliers, and other alliance partners located in various countries to manage or support its business operations, provide professional services, deliver customer services and solutions, and otherwise process information on DXC behalf. It is DXC's practice to require such service providers, suppliers and alliance partners to handle personal data and other confidential information in a manner consistent with DXC's policies. 

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, DXC decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of such information from sellers. It is DXC’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions. 

Please be aware that in certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies pursuant to judicial proceeding, court order, law enforcement or legal process. We may also share your information to protect the rights or property of DXC, our business partners, suppliers or clients, and others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected. 

Registration is not required to gain access to DXC websites. However, if you choose to receive certain services, specific material and information your subscription is required on certain DXC websites. 

In this regard, DXC may collect personal information from you including your name, phone number, email address, or other information you choose to provide at various times, for example, when you complete an online form or request or participate in an online community. 

You can make or change your choices about receiving either subscription or general communications at the data collection point, within your account preference settings or by using other methods, which are listed in this Privacy Statement. You may opt-out at any time using the links at the bottom of any email or via the [DXC Preference Center](https://connect.dxc.com/PreferenceCenter). 

Please note, this option does not apply to communications primarily for the purpose of administering business relationships, including contracts, support, or other administrative and transactional notices where the primary purpose of these communications is not promotional in nature. 

DXC recognizes and respects the varying national laws and obligations and their impact on cross-border data transfers. When transferring personal information outside of the country of collection for the purposes identified above, DXC will do so in compliance with applicable law. 

In the development of DXC’s privacy policies and standards, we respect and take into account the major privacy and data protection principles and frameworks around the world and any amendments applied thereto from time-to-time, including the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the UK Data Protection Act 1988, the APEC Privacy Framework, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), and the Australian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988. 

EU Personal Data Transfers 

For personal data originating from a European Union (EU) member state, DXC uses a variety of lawful data transfer mechanisms for this purpose, including EU Standard Contractual Clauses 

DXC has an intragroup agreement on the transfer and processing of personal data within the DXC group worldwide which has the EU Standard Contractual Clauses incorporated. This agreement allows DXC to ensure that personal data, including data originating from the EU, which is transferred cross-border and processed by other DXC group companies, including those located outside the EU, is adequately protected in accordance with applicable data protection law. 

Companies like DXC Technology who are regulated by and therefore subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission are given the opportunity to offer their clients and partners an alternative and efficient way to legally share personal information originating from within the EU or Switzerland. Consistent with this, DXC, and all other U.S. based DXC entities and affiliates as listed below (‘covered DXC entities’), comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. DXC, for itself and on behalf of the covered DXC entities, has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Enterprise Online Privacy Statement and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. Further details are provided below. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, and to view DXC's certification, please visit: [http://www.privacyshield.gov](http://www.privacyshield.gov/).

__Enforcement, Independent Recourse Mechanism and Liability__

_Enforcement:_

DXC is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). 

_Recourse Mechanism:_

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, DXC, for itself and on behalf of the covered DXC entities, commits to resolve complaints about its collection or use of personal information.  EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact DXC’s Privacy and Data Protection Office at: 

[privacy@dxc.com](mailto:privacy@dxc.com)

DXC, for itself and on behalf of the covered DXC entities, has further committed to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact the EU DPAs for more information or to file a complaint. The services of EU DPAs are provided at no cost to you. 

_Liability:_

In the context of an onward transfer, DXC, and any of the covered DXC entities, has responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. DXC, and any of the covered DXC entities, shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless the respective Privacy Shield organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. 

For the avoidance of doubts, DXC, or any of the covered DXC entity, is not liable under the Privacy Shield Principles when on behalf of another organization DXC, or any of the covered DXC entity, merely transmit, route, switch, or cache information. As is the case with the EU Directive itself, the Privacy Shield does not create secondary liability. To the extent that DXC, or any of the covered DXC entity, is acting as a mere conduit for data transmitted by third parties and does not determine the purposes and means of processing those personal data, it would not be liable. 

__Disclosure of Personal Data__
