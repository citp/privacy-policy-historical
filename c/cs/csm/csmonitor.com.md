Privacy policy

We at The Christian Science Monitor respect and protect the privacy of our users. 

What information do we collect from our users and how do we collect it?

First: this site does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals, for instance, when purchasing a subscription to our Monitor Extra service. 

We do collect anonymous, aggregated data and provide it to our advertisers and other companies that we do business with for market research and statistical purposes. The Christian Science Monitor may use such information to help determine ways to improve our site. 

We do not provide, sell or lease personally identifiable information to any third parties. If you have any questions or concerns regarding what is done with your information on any part of The Christian Science Monitor, please e-mail us at [support@csmonitor.com](mailto:support@csmonitor.com). 

Finally, you should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., first and last name, address, e-mail address, etc.) in our forums, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other parties or people posting messages. 

What are cookies? How do you use them?

"Cookies" are text files that are used to collect information about visits that helps us create an overall profile of how visitors use our site. Cookies cannot be used to collect data from any user's computer - cookies can only be used in conjunction with the site being visited. 

See <http://www.builder.com/Programming/Cookies/ss01.html> for more information about cookies. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some portions of The Christian Science Monitor will not function properly if you do so. For further information on cookies and their use, see the help instructions delivered with your browser or contact the browser's manufacturer. 

You also may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. The Christian Science Monitor does not control those cookies and those cookies are not subject to this policy. Please note that the use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is common in the Internet industry. 

What about children using your site — is their privacy protected?

Yes, but children should be sure to ask their parents for permission before they send any information about themselves (name, address, e-mail address, etc.) to us or anyone else over the Internet, and before making any purchases online. 

And we encourage parents to get involved with their children's online usage and to be aware of activities in which they are participating. As with adults using our site, any personally identifiable information collected by The Christian Science Monitor from children will be used only for Monitor internal purposes. Additionally, anonymous aggregated data is sometimes provided to other companies which we do business with, for statistical and market research purposes as described above. Finally, parents should be aware that if a child voluntarily discloses his or her name, e-mail address, etc. on various forums, or chat areas, such disclosure may result in unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, you should discourage your child from doing so. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy please [e-mail](mailto:support@csmonitor.com) us.
