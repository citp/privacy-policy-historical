# Privacy Policy - The Christian Science Monitor - CSMonitor.com

We at The Christian Science Monitor respect and protect the privacy of our users.

 **What information do we collect from our users and how do we collect it?**

First: this site, www.CSMonitor.com (the “Site”), does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals, for instance, when purchasing a subscription to one of our products or services, such as a print or electronic edition of The Christian Science Monitor, or when signing up for one of our e-mail newsletters.

In particular, when purchasing a subscription or signing up for an e-mail newsletter, you must provide certain contact information (e.g., your name, e-mail and shipping address, as applicable) and you may be asked to provide financial information (e.g., credit card number, expiration date, billing address, etc.) to be used for billing purposes and to fill customers' orders. If the Site has trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you.

We also collect anonymous, aggregated data from our website and e-mail newsletters, and provide it to our advertisers and other companies that we do business with for market research and statistical purposes. The Christian Science Monitor may use such information to help determine ways to improve our Site. The Christian Science Monitor reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its website and e-newsletter visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers. Please note that this is not personally identifiable information, only general summaries of the activities of our visitors and customers.

We also allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) collected during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use cookies or third party web beacons to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

The Christian Science Monitor supplies some of its subscriptions and content, such as the Digital Edition and the Historic Archive 1901 - 1980, through third parties. These services and purchases are processed by third-parties on behalf of The Christian Science Monitor, and such third-parties collect and store billing and credit card information solely to process these purchases. This information will not be used for any other reason except as instructed by the Monitor.

Generally, we do not provide, sell or lease personally identifiable information to any third parties. However, if you provide us with your postal address when subscribing to the print edition we may include that address in postal address lists that we sell or rent to third parties. If you would like us to stop including your postal address in such lists, please send us a letter addressed to The Christian Science Monitor, P.O. Box 98, Boston, MA 02117-0098, or please [e-mail us](mailto:service@csmonitor.com), requesting that we remove your postal address from these lists. Also, to protect site visitors and the general welfare, the site will release personal information when necessary in order to comply with the law or regulatory authorities.

You will receive advertising information from the Monitor when you sign up to receive such information on the [Monitor E-mail Newsletters](http://link.csmonitor.com/join/34f/signup) page.

If you submit your email address to the Site in other ways, such as submitting a comment or question, we may contact you about receiving occasional offers from advertisers.

We do not provide users' personally identifiable information to our advertising partners. Advertisers will only receive your personally identifiable information if you provide it to them directly. If you have any questions or concerns regarding what is done with your information on any part of CSMonitor.com, or would like such information deleted from our records (with the exception of postal addresses) please [e-mail us](mailto:service@csmonitor.com).

We may employ third parties to perform Site-related services, including database management, maintenance services, analytics, marketing, data processing, and email and text message distribution. These third parties have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf.

The Site's offices are located in the United States. If you visit the Site from another country, please be aware that information you provide to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of the Site may be processed in and transferred to the United States and will be subject to U.S. law.

 **Is the information you collect about me secure?**

We take every precaution to protect users' information. When you submit sensitive information via the Site, your information is protected both online and offline from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, and unlawful destruction or accidental loss.

 **What about children using your site - is their privacy protected?**

Yes.

In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), The Christian Science Monitor does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent. If it is learned that such information has been collected without parental consent, that information will be deleted from the Site's database as quickly as practical or the child's parent(s) will be contacted to obtain consent for the collection of the information.

And we encourage parents to get involved with their children's online usage and to be aware of activities in which they are participating.

Finally, parents should be aware that if a child voluntarily discloses his or her name, e-mail address, etc. on various forums, or chat areas, such disclosure may result in unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, you should discourage your child from doing so.

 **What about my privacy on linked sites?**
