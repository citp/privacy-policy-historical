  * to promote and market our activities.



From time to time, we may need to disclose personal information to our joint venture partners or share information with contractors or agents who provide services to us, such as off-site file storage facilities and financial institutions which transmit payments on our behalf.

The collection of such information may also have ethical approval requirements.

When dealing with personal information in a research context, we will usually de-identify that information. If personal information is not de-identified, we will deal with personal information collected in the course of research in accordance with the Privacy Act.

This information may be used to disseminate information and to facilitate participation in events and CSIRO activities. In managing this information, we will:

  * hold all personal information in secure databases, both at onsite and offsite locations.
  * ensure that at any time, a recipient of e-mailed mass communication may ask to “unsubscribe” from our central marketing/communication database.
  * ensure that a direct link to “unsubscribe” is generally made available in mass communications from us. Alternatively, unsubscribe requests can be made directly to CSIRO Enquiries.



## Managing our personnel and other support services functions

CSIRO will collect personal information from prospective employees for the purposes of administering a recruitment process. Unlike the private sector, CSIRO’s employee records are subject to the Privacy Act and we use the personal information of CSIRO staff for the purposes of administering their employment with CSIRO. This may include using and disclosing personal information for:

  * general management of employment;
  * performance management (misconduct, grievance, probation);

## Freedom of Information requests

We collect personal information when administering an individual’s request for access to documents under the _Freedom of Information Act 1984_ __ (Cth).

## CSIRO as a contracted service provider to other Commonwealth agencies

We may, from time to time, engage service providers to provide services to us. Where those services involve a service provider dealing with personal information on our behalf, we will ensure that our contract with the service provider obliges the service provider to comply with the same level privacy obligations as CSIRO.

## How does CSIRO store personal information?

Each area of CSIRO that collects personal information stores that information securely on CSIRO’s IT systems. These systems are password protected and where required, only certain people are authorised to access the information. We also have recordkeeping obligations under the _Archives Act 1983 (Cth)_ , and have record keeping codes specific to particular areas of CSIRO activity. We are also required to comply with other government policies in relation to storage and security of information, including the _Australian Government Policy and Risk Management Guidelines for the storage and processing of Australian Government information in outsourced or offshore ICT arrangements_ and the _Protective Security Policy Framework_ , complemented by the _Australian Government Information Security Manual_.

We may use third parties to store some personal information on servers in Australia or overseas, but only where steps have been taken to ensure that the third parties comply with our privacy obligations.

## Disclosures of personal information overseas

We may disclose personal information overseas from time to time, for example in the course of a research project with an overseas entity, through publishing information or by storing information on a server located overseas. Where we may be transferring personal information overseas, we will either inform you and seek your consent to the arrangement or ensure that appropriate contractual measures are in place to ensure that the overseas entity protects the personal information to the same level as required of CSIRO under the Privacy Act.

## Access to and amendment of personal information held by CSIRO

We will provide you with access to your personal information that we hold, subject to any applicable exceptions under the Privacy Act. We will require you to verify your identity and specify, as clearly as possible, the information that you wish to access. We will not charge you for lodging a request for access to your own personal information but may charge for reasonable administrative costs. The fee will be determined on a case by case basis and you will be informed beforehand of the likely cost.

CSIRO employees seeking their employment details should initially do so in accordance with CSIRO’s human resources processes. CSIRO is also subject to the _Freedom of Information Act 1984_ (Cth) and this operates alongside your right to access your personal information under the Privacy ACT.

If you can establish that information held by us about you is inaccurate, irrelevant, out of date, incomplete or misleading, we will take reasonable steps to amend it. If we disagree with your view about the status of this information, we will provide reasons for the refusal and record a statement in our records of your view.
