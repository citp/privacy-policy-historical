CSI Software is committed to protecting your privacy. You can visit most pages on our site without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request, and this privacy statement explains data collection and use in those situations. This privacy statement only applies to CSI Software.com; it does not apply to other online or offline CSI Software sites, products or services.

Generally, this information is requested when you are registering before entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access premium site, signing up for an event or training, or when purchasing and/or registering CSI Software product information. Personal information collected by CSI Software often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested.

For example: If you choose a service or transaction that requires payment, such as making a purchase in the Request Form of the Web site, we will request personal information necessary for billing and/or shipping, such as: name, address, telephone number, and credit card number.
