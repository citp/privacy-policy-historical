##  Q1: Why does CSI need my personal information? What will you use it for?

CSI collects a limited amount of personal information to create your personal profile, a tool that distinguishes you from all other CSI students. Specifically, CSI will use that profile and your information to:

  * Keep records of your education, course history and designation progress.
  * Prepare regulatory reports if you're seeking industry licenses.
  * Give you your course marks.
  * Process your course or seminar enrolment.
  * Tell you about new CSI courses and opportunities.
  * Send you course materials, and awards.
  * Maintain your individual investment simulation information.
  * Share third-party offerings that we think you'd be interested in.



##  Q2: Do I have to provide my personal information?

While you can choose not to provide CSI with your personal information, this will prevent CSI from creating your student profile.Without that tool CSI will be unable to process your enrolment – you can still attend CSI courses, but you will be unable to write an exam or attain accreditation.

You should also know that not all the information CSI requests is mandatory.

Here is a sample list of questions we need to ask:

  1. name (first name and surname)
  2. contact address (street address, city/town, province, country, postal code)
  3. telephone number and email address
  4. business address, telephone number and email address, under certain circumstances
  5. birth date 
  6. last 3 digits of your SIN to distinguish between students with similar names and/or contact information
  7. payment/credit card information
  8. name of course/service you are enrolled in



Optional information helps us understand you better so that we can anticipate your needs. For example, we like to know why you have chosen CSI so we can assist you in managing your career with appropriate products and services. We also like to know what your background might be so our courses are communicated in a meaningful way. Some examples of optional information include:

  1. reason for enrolment
  2. years of financial services experience
  3. education level
  4. gender
  5. survey questions

##  Q3: Can you tell me more about the privacy legislation enacted in 2004?

CSI respects your privacy, and has created this policy in response to the legislation you are referring to.You can learn more about the legislation on the federal government's privacy website at www.privcom.gc.ca.

##  Q4: Will you share my personal information with any other companies?

Under no circumstances will CSI sell or distribute your information – we're dedicated to protecting your privacy.With that in mind and to serve you better, CSI may share your file to make sure we're offering the most efficient and effective learning experience available.

_Specific instances when this might happen include:_

  * Sharing your personal information with our suppliers and agents to print and distribute course materials, to survey you or with a CSI subsidiary to offer you additional financial market resources.
  * Compiling records and reports tracking information like general pass or failure trends to continually enhance our services and offerings.Your Student ID is used here, so your name is never associated with your results.
  * Reporting to regulators. Regulators can ask CSI for information about licensed registrants or students who apply to be registered.There are also rare occasions where CSI will report events to the IDA or other licensing regulators (eg. significant academic infractions).
  * CSI may, from time to time, partner with companies that offer student or alumni benefits through their products. CSI will handle the first contact with you and give you the option to opt out of future communications from those companies. In choosing its partners to present to you, CSI will require those companies to certify that they will treat your personal information with the same standard of care that we do.



##  Q5: Can my employer see my personal information?

If you're enrolling through your employer, they may require that you complete an information release consent form.That form allows CSI to share information with your employer if they request it. If you are not enrolling through your employer, we will not share information with them.

##  Q6: How do you protect my personal information?

CSI takes a number of steps to protect your information.

**ONLINE:** CSI's website at www.csi.ca is a secure site – you will see a lock icon appear on your screen (usually in the lower right corner but the actual location may change depending on your operating system and browser).That symbol means that any information you enter (name, date of birth, payment information etc.) while on that page is protected using industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.

**HARD COPY:** CSI gives equal priority to protecting your personal information in paper-based forms or reports.All documents with any of your personal information on it are kept in a locked cabinet or locked room at CSI with restricted access.

##  Q7: How long will CSI keep information about me?

CSI needs your personal information to provide certain services during your enrolment period. Once that time has ended, CSI will retain some information, such as your exam marks and acquired CSI designations, as well as your contact information, indefinitely.

##  Q8: What am I agreeing to when I consent to CSI's privacy policy?
