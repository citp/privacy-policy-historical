# CSA Privacy Policy

CSA is committed to respecting the privacy of its customers and individual users who access our databases over the Internet. 

As a service to users, you can choose to store temporarily your search results on our Web server by using your e-mail address. CSA does not use this address for any other purpose, and you can delete the search results at any time, which automatically removes your e-mail address from our system. We do track database usage, page visits, and searches made for the purposes of providing aggregated statistical information to our customers and information partners. These tracking functions are done at the organizational customer level by IP address which identifies the customer's server and does not reveal the identity of any individual user. 

There will be occasions when you volunteer information about yourself. For instance, when you complete any of our registration forms on our Web site you will be giving us information about your role as a representative of your organization. User-specific information volunteered by you in these instances is archived for CSA marketing and sales use only. CSA does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Additionally, when you initiate contact with CSA through our Web site or by e-mail, you will be supplying us with information about what your concerns are, as well as how to contact you. CSA may want to use the information you provide to respond to you and to continue to contact you in the future. If you do not want CSA to contact you, you can choose to "opt out," and CSA will respect your wishes. 

CSA has several links to outside resources in an effort to help individuals gather information. CSA is not responsible for the content provided on these sites, their privacy policies, or how they treat information about their users. 

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information if we are required to do so by law, or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on CSA or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of CSA; or, (c) protect the personal safety of users of CSA, its web sites, or the public. 

If you have any questions or comments about our privacy practices, or if you would like to stop receiving information from CSA or correct any information you have submitted, please contact us at [marketing@csa.com](mailto:marketing@csa.com).
