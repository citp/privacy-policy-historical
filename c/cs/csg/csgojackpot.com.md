We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for their commercial or marketing use with your consent or as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to your requests for customer service.

We will publish a profile page that includes your username, the date you became a member, your stats from previous contests and, if you uploaded one, your profile picture.

Your Choices

You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through CSGO:Jackpot, in which case CSGO:Jackpot may not be able to provide certain services to you.

To protect your privacy and security, we reserve the right to take reasonable steps (such as requesting your password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and account information at all times.

Data Security

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. All sensitive information is encrypted.

Any financial transactions are processed by third party payment processing suppliers who employ security measures, including encryption protocols and storage procedures, which we believe to be at least as effective as the industry standard.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use commercially reasonable technical, physical, administrative and managerial procedures, security measures and safeguards to try to prevent unauthorized access to, and to preserve the integrity and security of, your personal information.

If you are accessing the Site from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, you acknowledge that you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent and agree to that transfer.

Merger, Sale, or Court Order

Circumstances may arise where we are required to disclose your personal information to third parties for purposes other than to support your customer relationship with CSGO:Jackpot, such as in connection with a corporate divestiture or dissolution where we sell all or a portion of our business or assets, or if disclosure is required by law or court order.

Publicity

Except where prohibited, participation in a contest constitutes the player's consent to the use by CSGO:Jackpot and its agents of player's name, likeness, voice, opinions, and biographical information for publicity, advertising, trade, or promotional purposes in any media or manner, now known or hereafter devised, worldwide, without further payment, consideration, notice, or approval.

This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the "Last update posted" date above. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of CSGO:Jackpot constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any future revisions.
