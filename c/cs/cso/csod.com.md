# Privacy Policy - Cornerstone OnDemand

##  Introduction 

* * *

Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our website and services (collectively, "Cornerstone" or "Website"). We will not use or share your Personal Information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. 

Our company is certified to the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. 

By visiting or using any part of this Website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy as they may be amended from time to time. As we update and expand our Website, this Privacy Policy may change, so please check this web page for updates to our Privacy Policy. Further, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and is a part of, this Website's Terms of Use agreement, which also governs your use of this Website.

##  Collection of Information 

When you visit our Website we may collect information regarding your visit from your computer. Such information helps us to determine information about how you found our Website, the date that you visited our Website and search engines that may have led you to our Website. We collect this information in order to continually improve and enhance the functionality of Cornerstone. 

Generally, you may provide us with two types of information, User Provided Information and Website Usage Information, both of which are discussed in greater detail below. 

##  Personal Information You Choose to Provide 

In order to make your visits to our Website as enjoyable as possible, we may ask you for Personal Information. Personal Information includes, for example, your name and email address, both of which you may be asked to provide when registering with Cornerstone. Below is a description of some of the ways that you may provide Personal Information to us, as well as further details on how we may use such Personal Information.

##  1\. Contact Us/Feedback 

If you email us through a [contact us](http://www.cornerstoneondemand.com/contact-us) link on our Website, we may ask you for information such as your name and email address so we can respond to your questions and comments. If you choose to correspond with us via email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our response to you. In certain cases, and with your permission, we may post content from your emails to us on the Website.

##  2\. Questionnaires and Surveys 

We may occasionally ask viewers of our Website to complete online surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys help us better serve you and improve the usefulness of Cornerstone. In requesting your participation in these surveys we may ask you to provide you name and email address to us.

##  3\. Bulletin Boards 

Our Website may offer its users the opportunity to use bulletin board blogs, chat rooms, and engage in discussions with other users. If you choose to use these features, you should be aware that any Personal Information you submit through these features can be read, collected, or used by other viewers of these forums and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personal Information you choose to submit in these forums. 

##  1\. Cookies 

When visiting Cornerstone, we may use "cookies" on or in connection with our Website to maintain information about you. A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. Cornerstone employs the use of both "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Website. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.

When you visit our Website, our computer may ask your computer for permission to employ the use of a session or persistent cookie. Our Website will then send a cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits our Website to access the cookies it has already sent to you and not the cookies sent to you by other websites. 

Most web browsers can be adjusted to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, our Website or certain areas or features of our Website. 

##  2\. Clear GIFs 

When visiting Cornerstone, we may also use "Clear GIFs" (aka "web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies in our Website and/or in our communications with you. A Clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which helps us to verify an individual's viewing or receipt of a web page or message. Clear GIFs allow us to know whether you have viewed a web page prior to visiting our Website and may enable us to relate such information to other information, including your Personal Information. We use information provided from Clear GIFs to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Cornerstone better for our users. 

##  3\. IP Address and Clickstream Data 

Our servers automatically collect data about your Internet Protocol address when you visit us. When you request pages from our Website, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another website or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Website; the website you visit after this Website; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Website or a referral website; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Website. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider. We may also link this information with Personal Information. 

Any or all of these activities with regard to the above-described Website Usage Information may be performed on our behalf by our third-party service providers. (See Sharing Information with Third Parties section below. 

##  Rights to Out In/Opt Out 

You have the right to "opt in" and/or "opt out" of certain of our uses of your Personal Information. For example, if you are prompted to provide Personal Information on this Website or in connection with our communications to you, you may have the opportunity to elect whether you would like to receive such correspondence from us. You may opt out of Cornerstone's promotional e-mails by clicking on the opt-out or "unsubscribe" link within the email you receive. You can also make this request by sending an email to [info@csod.com](mailto:info@csod.com), specifying whether: (i) you would like to opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from Cornerstone in general, or just via e-mail, postal mail and/or by phone, and/or whether (ii) you would only like to opt out of certain of Cornerstone's e-newsletters or correspondence. 

Please understand that if you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with us. 

##  Use and Disclosure of Personal Information 

We will use your Personal Information for various purposes, including, for example, to respond to your requests and to provide you with our product and service offerings. We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record keeping. We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Website Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources, including (without limitation) any of our other websites and third parties. In addition, we may send you notices (for example, in the form of emails, mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies, events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you. You may opt out of receiving such notices from us by following the instructions in the Rights to Opt In/Opt Out section above.

##  Third-Party Websites 

When you are on this Website you may have the opportunity to visit, or link to, other websites, including other websites operated by us or by unaffiliated third parties.

##  Privacy of Minors 

This Website is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen on our Website. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a visitor under the age of thirteen on our Website, we will delete the information from our records. 

##  Security 

We use commercially reasonable and industry standard physical, managerial and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information. We also use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to transmit sensitive information. While we endeavor to protect the security and integrity of sensitive Personal Information provided to this Website, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. 

If you contact us by email or a "contact us" or similar feature on the Website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. An unaffiliated third party could view information you send by these methods in transit. We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.

In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your email address, we may notify you by email. **You consent to our use of email as a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please email us at[info@csod.com](mailto:info@csod.com) with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.**
