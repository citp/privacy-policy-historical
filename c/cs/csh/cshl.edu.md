## Personal Information we collect and use

## How we use your Personal Information and the basis on which we use it

We use your Personal Information for the following purposes:

  * **Identification:** We use your identification information, including your photograph, to physically identify you when you access certain CSHL facilities or check in at CSHL events. This processing is necessary to serve our legitimate interest in keeping our facilities safe and secure.
  * **Authentication:** We use your authenticating information, including user names, passwords, security questions and answers, to verify your identity when accessing or logging into the Services and to safeguard your Personal Information. This processing is necessary to comply with our contractual obligations to you and to support our legitimate interests in securing the Services for our users.
  * **Reviewing applications:** We process your Personal Information when you apply for our URP or Ph.D. programs, internships, fellowships, CSHL-sponsored programs or grants, and employment with CSHL. Our basis for processing is often the performance of pre-contractual relations we have with you. Any processing outside the scope of a pre-contractual obligation is necessary to serve our legitimate interests in evaluating an applicant’s personal, educational, financial, and/or professional background to make employment decisions and to compile statistical information to evaluate CSHL’s diversity or equal opportunity performance.
  * **Fulfillment:** We process your Personal Information to provide the Services or information you have requested. For example, we may process your information to register you for our public events; facilitate your travel to or accommodations at our events; publish the content you submit to our online forums or message boards; or provide you access to and functionalities within our online databases. This is so we can provide our Services according to our contract with you.
  * **Charitable giving:** We process your Personal Information with regard to donations. For example, we maintain contact information of past or potential donors to send newsletters or donation requests, and our donors are eligible to appear on our publicly available Honor Role of Donors page. We may rely upon your consent as required by applicable law. Where we do not rely upon consent, this processing is necessary to serve our legitimate interests in maintaining an ongoing relationship with past or potential donors for the benefit of CSHL as well as in communicating CSHL’s funding successes to the scientific research community.
  * **Improving our website and Services:** We analyze information about how you use our website or related Services, including site analytics, to provide an improved experience across our website. It is in our legitimate interest to use the information provided to us for this purpose, so we can understand and improve upon any issues with our website or Services.
  * **Improving our institutional effectiveness:** We may use your Personal Information to assess our performance as an institution, including analyzing repeat program participation, event attendance, or partnerships. For example, we may analyze connections between webpages accessed and new newsletter registrations, or between event attendance and donations, and we do this in order to promote or improve specific resources. It is in our legitimate interests to use the information provided to us for this purpose, so we can understand and improve upon any issues with institutional Services.
  * **Communicating with you:** We may use your Personal Information when we communicate with you, for example, if we are providing information about our programs or events, including sending you CSHL newsletters and publications. We also use your Personal Information to respond to you if you contact us with questions. It is in our legitimate interests to provide you with appropriate responses and with notices about our Services.
  * **Emergency communications:** We may use your Personal Information to respond to emergencies, for example, if we need to contact your family or other contact in the event of an incident. This processing is necessary to serve our legitimate interests in supporting the health and wellbeing of individuals while participating in CSHL-sponsored opportunities or accessing CSHL-sponsored Services.
  * **Personalization and marketing:** We may use your Personal Information to understand your preferences in order to personalize the marketing messages and other content we provide you. We also may use your photograph in our marketing materials, for example, if you attend a public event we may use photographs from the event to market the program to prospective participants. It is in our legitimate interest to provide more relevant content and communications. Where necessary, we will obtain your consent before sending such marketing messages.
  * **Exercising our rights:** We may use your Personal Information to exercise our legal rights where it is necessary to do so, for example to detect, prevent, and respond to fraud, intellectual property infringement, or violations of law or contract.
  * **Complying with our obligations:** We may process your Personal Information to comply with legal or regulatory requirements, where required by law.



In addition to the purposes listed above, we may use certain categories of sensitive information in the following ways:

  * **Health and medical information:** To the extent we process health and medical information, we do so to comply with legal obligations (e.g., to provide disability accommodations) or when such processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or another person. In some contexts, this information may be processed with your consent.
  * **Information revealing racial or ethnic origin:** To the extent we process information revealing racial or ethnic origin, such information is voluntarily disclosed during the application or registration process. In this instance, we rely on your express consent for processing.
  * **Criminal charges or convictions:** To the extent we process information relating to criminal charges or convictions, we do so to comply with legal obligations or, where not required by law, to serve our legitimate interests in selecting a qualified and suitable workforce in order to protect the safety and security of our facilities.



We also may anonymize your Personal Information in such a way that you may not reasonably be re-identified, and we may use this anonymized information for any other purpose.

We share your Personal Information with third parties under the following circumstances:

  * **CSHL partners and affiliates:** CSHL partners with other organizations for a number of purposes, including clinical outreach, business development, programs and grants, research initiatives, or other strategic affiliations.
