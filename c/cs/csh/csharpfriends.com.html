						Your use of the CSharpFriends.com Web site constitutes 
your agreement to this privacy policy and consent to the terms herein. Please 
see the section labeled "Information We Collect and How We Use It" to learn more 
about our collection and use of user information. 
<h3>Introduction
										</h3>CSharpFriends.com is committed to safeguarding the privacy of 
visitors to our Web site and users of the other services available through our 
site (the "Service(s)"). We will use our best efforts to ensure that the 
information you provide us remains private and is used only for the purposes set 
forth herein. 
<p>This privacy policy details our commitment to protect your information and the limited manner in which we will use that 
											information to provide and improve our provision of the Services.
											</p><h3>Important Terms Used Throughout This Privacy Policy
											</h3>
											Throughout this privacy policy we use several specialized terms. "Personally 
											Identifiable Information" is information that tells us specifically who you 
											are, like your name, street address, email address, billing address, credit 
											card number and expiration date. "User Information" means all Personally 
											Identifiable Information and any other forms of information discussed in this 
											privacy policy, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user's 
											computer. We use the term "aggregate" when we combine information from various 
											persons or users. Information is said to be "anonymized" if it does not 
											identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person or 
											entity with such information.
											<h3>Information We Collect and How We Use It
											</h3>If you visit our site to 
browse. We will only collect and store the domain name and host from which a 
user accessed the Internet (e.g., aol.com), the IP address of the user's 
computer, the user's browser software and operating system, the date and time 
the user accesses the site and the Internet address of any Web site from which 
the user linked directly to our site or to which the user links after visiting 
our site. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to sections 
of our sites, to determine from where our visitors linked and to where our 
visitors link from the sites and to help us make our sites more useful. For 
example, we organize and analyze IP addresses so that we can provide efficient 
service, enhance security, monitor appropriate usage and produce traffic volume 
statistics. This type of information is sometimes shared with third parties, 
such as when we aggregate and disclose site traffic information for marketing 
and commercial purposes. When we share such information with third parties we 
will require them to abide by the standards of this privacy policy. 
<p>If you register or engage in a transaction while at our site. To make full 
use of our Services you will need to complete our registration process. We 
collect and store the Personally Identifiable Information you provide through 
this registration process, including your user ID and password, which we may 
elect to provide for you. If you engage in a transaction while logged on to our 
site, then we collect and store information about the transaction. If you send 
us communications, then we may collect such communications in a file specific to 
you. 
</p><p>We use the information we collect from you as a registered user to build features that we hope will make the Services 
											more attractive and easier for you to use. This may include better customer 
											support and timely notice of new services. We may share User Information with 
											our partners, affiliates and joint venturers that are committed to serving your 
											need for the Services and improving your user experience, but will require such 
											third parties to abide by the standards of this privacy policy. We may also 
											share aggregate anonymized data relating to activity on the site and use of the 
											Services, such as demographical and statistical information, for marketing, 
											research and other purposes. Furthermore, we may need to disclose User 
											Information to law enforcement or other government officials if appropriate for 
											your protection or in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual 
											property infringement or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or our 
											users to legal liability.
											</p><h3>If You Do Not Wish to Disclose User Information
											</h3>
											If you do not want to provide us with certain User Information then you may opt 
											out by not using the Service that provides us with such User Information. For 
											example, if you do not want us to retain your name, then you may choose not to 
											become a registered user. You will not be entitled to the benefits of 
											registration, but you are still free to browse the site and to visit the parts 
											of the site accessible to non-registrants.
											<h3>Cookies
											</h3>
											Cookies are small text files that our site can send to your browser for storage 
											on your hard drive. Cookies can make your use of our site easier by saving your 
											status and preferences upon visits to our site. The cookies are refreshed every 
											time you enter the site. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but 
											you may be able to change the settings to refuse cookies or to be alerted when 
											cookies are being sent. We use cookies for two purposes: (1) to enable 
											CSharpFriends.com to customize information for certain segments of its customer 
											base; and (2) in some instances, to associate you with your User Information. 
											For example, through the use of cookies you may login automatically and thereby 
											save you time. Although rejection of cookies will not interfere with your 
											ability to interact with most of our site, you will need to accept cookies in 
											order to login and use certain interactive Services on the site.
											<h3>Control of Your Password
											</h3>
											Except as specifically permitted by this privacy policy or your User Agreement 
											you may not disclose your CSharpFriends.com password to any third parties nor 
											share it with any third parties. If you lose control of your CSharpFriends.com 
											password you may lose control over your Personally Identifiable Information, 
											and you will be responsible for any legally binding actions taken on your 
											behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you 
											should immediately change your password or, if we provided your password, 
											notify CSharpFriends.com so that we may issue you a new password.
											<h3>Removal or Correction of Personally Identifiable Information
											</h3>
											Upon your request, we may remove your Personally Identifiable Information from 
											our database and correct any errors you identify in such information. If 
											Personally Identifiable Information is removed you will lose access to the 
											parts of the site for which you must provide such Personally Identifiable 
											Information to gain access. After removal, we will only retain copies of such 
											information as are necessary for us to comply with governmental orders, resolve 
											disputes, troubleshoot problems, enforce any agreement you have entered into 
											through our sites and as otherwise reasonably necessary. Any Personally 
											Identifiable Information provided as a part of a transaction on the site 
											represents a record of that business transaction that cannot be altered after 
											the transaction is complete.
											<h3>Third Parties
											</h3>This privacy policy only addresses the use and disclosure 
of User Information collected by CSharpFriends.com. If you disclose information to other 
parties, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of such 
information regardless of their affiliation or relationship with CSharpFriends.com.

before you disclose your personal information to third parties. 
<p>We do not try to control, and disclaim responsibility for, information provided by other users or third parties that is 
											made available through our site. Such information may contain errors, 
											intentional or otherwise, or may be offensive, inappropriate or inaccurate, and 
											in some cases will be mislabeled or deceptively labeled.
											</p><h3>Merger, Assets, Sales, etc.
											</h3>
											If CSharpFriends.com or any of its lines of business is sold, pledged or 
											disposed of as a going concern whether by merger, sale of assets, bankruptcy or 
											otherwise, then the user database of CSharpFriends.com could be sold as part of 
											that transaction and all User Information accessed by such successor or 
											purchaser.
