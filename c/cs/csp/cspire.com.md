We also may collect demographic information such as age, education, gender, and ZIP code. In addition, your participation in certain personalized offerings on the Sites may lead to C Spire's collection of information from you; however, C Spire will inform you in the terms and conditions of such offerings prior to your agreement to participate in same, and provide you the ability to opt-out of our collection and use of such information.

In addition, please note that you may be asked by third party application providers to provide them access to your location data. You should carefully review the terms and conditions applicable to such applications and the privacy policies of any third-parties to whom you provide your consent to use location information, because when you use such third-party services their terms of use and privacy policies will govern. 
  * _Miscellaneous._ We obtain address information about you from third party sources, such as the US Postal Service, to verify your address so we can properly ship your order to you and to prevent fraud. Sometimes we purchase marketing data about our customers from third parties and combine it with information we already have about you to create more tailored advertising and products.

**USER ACCESS AND CHOICE**

C Spire prides itself on providing you a personalized experience. But we understand that participating in personalization is your choice to make. That is why we have created a [Your Preference Profile](https://www.cspire.com/my_account/personal/profile/), so you may view your choices about how we may contact you. If you are a customer of C Spire and the Account Holder, then you can manage the privacy preferences of each mobile number on your account. If you are not the Account Holder on the C Spire account, you may have the ability to manage certain preferences subject to modification by the Account Holder. 

You may request that we stop collection and delete certain information by sending an email with such request to [askus@cspire.com](mailto:askus@cspire.com); however, please note that we have legal obligations to retain certain information, and must retain certain information necessary for us to provide our customers services. Notwithstanding these limitations, if you make such a request, we will stop the collection and ensure that information we are not otherwise legally obligated to keep and not needed to provide the services is removed according to our normal processes. 

**CPNI**

Section 222 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended (the "Telecommunications Act") establishes certain criteria regarding the use of certain telephone customer information that we collect from our customers solely by virtue of the customer-carrier relationship, such as quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location and amount of use of the telecommunications services you receive, as well as billing information. The Telecommunications Act refers to this type of information as "customer proprietary network information," or CPNI. C Spire will disclose and/or use CPNI only as permitted by the Telecommunications Act and applicable rules and regulations. In complying with the Telecommunications Act, we may ask for our customers opt in to our use of certain information for marketing purposes. You may change these preferences at any time by visiting Your Preference profile.

**CONTACTING YOU**

We may periodically contact you regarding promotions, offers, products or services from C Spire, its affiliates, and/or third parties via email, SMS text message and/or other methods. We may also periodically contact you regarding your C Spire account status, phone or other matters relevant to C Spire customers or potential customers. You may opt out of receiving communications from us as provided in [Your Preference Profile](https://www.cspire.com/my_account/personal/profile/) You also have the ability to choose to remove your name from the list for receiving emails at any time by following the instructions contained within the emails, and to remove your name from list to receive texts by texting STOP in reply at any time. 

**TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES/COOKIES**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies on the Sites. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our site while persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of site users to enhance your experience and personalization on the Sites. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on the Sites.

You can remove persistent cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site may be limited.

We may employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as web beacons/web bugs) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our users' personally identifiable information.

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. As discussed above, this information includes IP addresses, browser type, ISP provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about the user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information, except that IP addresses may be tied to personally identifiable information.

We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences, or display content based upon what you view on the Sites to personalize your visit. Third parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Sites or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To manage Flash cookies please [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).

As stated above, the use of cookies and/or clear gifs by our advertising partners and service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. 

We partner with third parties to either display advertising on the Sites or to manage our advertising on other websites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by changing your settings on [Your Preference Profile](https://www.cspire.com/my_account/personal/profile/) or by clicking the AdChoices link in the footer of the website. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

**SECURITY**

C Spire takes precautions to protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure, theft and misuse. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

Also note that when you use third party applications or some portions of the Websites such as the forums and social networking services, any personal information you share is visible to other users and C Spire cannot protect it. You are responsible for the protection of the personal information you choose to share on third party applications or open portions of the Websites. Please be careful when doing so. 

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**

Our Sites may offer community forums, such as Circle and Inner Circle. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. The profile you create on our Sites will be publically accessible unless otherwise indicated. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [askus@cspire.com](mailto:askus@cspire.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

With your consent, we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us as indicated in this privacy statement.

Our Sites sometimes include social media features, widgets and plugins, such as the Like or Share Facebook buttons, or the Tweet this button on Twitter. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

You may have the ability log in to our Sites using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.

**CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY**

We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.
