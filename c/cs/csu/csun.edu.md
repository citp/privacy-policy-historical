Policy 500-8025
Revision Date: 11/07/2011
POLICY PURPOSE:
California State University, Northridge (CSUN) is responsible for taking all reasonable and appropriate steps for the
protection of the confidentiality, availability, privacy, and integrity of information in its custody. This includes the
physical security of the equipment where information is processed and maintained, and the preservation of information
in case of intentional, accidental, or natural disaster. In addition, CSUN is responsible for the maintenance and currency
of applications that use this information.
POLICY STATEMENT:
Enforcement of CSUN’s Information Security Policies and compliance with Federal and State regulations regarding
information technology is the responsibility of the President. Policy enforcement may be delegated to the Chief
Information Officer (CIO). All CSUN Information Security Policies are to be reviewed on an annual basis by the
Information Security Officer (ISO) for compliance with the CSU Information Security Policy and Federal and State
regulations.
This policy applies to all students (see Student Records Administrative Policy, #RR650-30), faculty and staff, consultants,
or any other persons having access to CSUN Information Technology. All unauthorized modifications, deletions, or
disclosures of information included in CSUN data resources that compromise the integrity of CSUN’s educational,
scholarly, and administrative programs, violate individual privacy rights, or constitute a criminal act are expressly
forbidden.
This policy is not limited to those systems and equipment operated and maintained by CSUN’s central technology
organization, Information Technology (IT), but applies to all data, systems and equipment on and off campus that
contain protected, confidential, or mission critical data, including college and departmental level systems and
equipment, and vendor hosted solutions.
APPLICABILITY AND AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY:
I. Privacy of Personal Information:
All users of campus information systems or network resources are advised to consider the open nature of information
disseminated electronically and must not assume any degree of privacy or restricted access to information they create
or store on campus systems. CSUN is a public university and information stored on campus information systems may be
subject to disclosure under state law. No campus information system or network resource can absolutely ensure that
unauthorized persons will not gain access to information or activities. However, CSUN acknowledges its obligation to
respect and protect confidential and protected information about individuals stored on campus information systems and
network resources.


II. Collection of Personal Information:
To comply with state and federal laws and regulations, CSUN will not collect personally identifiable information unless
the need for it has been clearly established.
     1. Where such information is collected:
                The campus will use reasonable efforts to ensure that personally identifiable information is adequately
                 protected from unauthorized disclosure.
                The campus will store personally identifiable information only when it is appropriate and relevant to the
                 purpose for which it has been collected.
                Access to Personal Information
     2. Except as noted elsewhere in CSUN policy, information about individuals stored on campus information systems
         may only be accessed by:
                The individual to whom the stored information applies or his/her designated representative(s).
                Authorized CSUN employees with a valid related business need to access, modify, or disclose that
                 information.
                Appropriate legal authorities.
When appropriate, authorized CSUN personnel following established campus procedures may access, modify, and/or
disclose information about individuals stored on campus information systems or a user’s activities on campus
information systems or network resources without consent from the individual. For example, CSUN may take such
actions for any of the following reasons:
     1. To comply with applicable laws or regulations.
     2. To comply with or enforce applicable CSUN policy.
     3. To ensure the confidentiality, integrity or availability of campus information.
     4. To respond to valid legal requests or demands for access to campus information.
If CSUN personnel accesses, modifies, and/or discloses information about an individual and/or his/her activities on
campus information systems or network resources, staff, faculty, and any other employees will make every reasonable
effort to respect information and communications that are privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure by CSU
policy or applicable laws.
The CSU Records Access Manual will be used as a guide to determine which records must be made available for public
inspection under the California Public Records Act.
III. Access to Electronic Data Containing Personal Information:
Individuals who access or store protected data must use due diligence to prevent unauthorized access and disclosure of
such assets.
Browsing, altering, or accessing electronic messages or stored files in another user’s account, computer, or storage
device is prohibited, even when such accounts or files are not password protected, unless specifically authorized by the
user for university related business reasons. This prohibition does not affect:


    1. Authorized access to shared files and/ or resources based on assigned roles and responsibilities.
    2. Authorized access by a network administrator, computer support technician, or departmental manager where
        such access is within the scope of that individual’s job duties.
    3. Access to implicitly publicly accessible resources such as University websites.
    4. Campus response to subpoenas or other court orders.
    5. Campus response to a request pursuant to public record disclosure laws.
