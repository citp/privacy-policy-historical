# Christie's - Privacy Policy

  
  
**Privacy Statement**

_Personal Information_

Christie's considers your privacy to be of utmost importance. In general, you may browse our Internet properties anonymously. However, certain of our online services require the collection of some personally identifying information, such as your name, address, and, when appropriate, your credit information.

Any personally identifying information you provide to us is securely stored in a database to which only authorized Christie's employees and agents have access. For particularly sensitive information, such as credit card numbers and accounting information, Christie's will employ accepted transmission and storage protocols, such as encryption, to prevent this information from being disclosed. Personally identifying information is not shared with third parties (other than in the course of completing a transaction at your request or delivering email notices as indicated below), even if you are a buyer or seller at auction, unless reasonably believed to be required by law, court order or any other such legal process. This information may, however, be used for internal data processing, such as compiling statistical information about the use of our Internet properties. As a service to you, we may also use this information to customize the content we offer. 

_Email_

In order to provide you with timely notice about upcoming auctions and events, Christie's may send you email notices based on your expressed interests and bidding history. To facilitate this service, Christie's, in conjunction with a reputable third-party vendor, may note some of the pages you visit on our website through the use of 1x1 pixel tags (also called clear gifs). At the bottom of each email you will be provided with the option to update your collecting interests or unsubscribe from future mailings. At any time, you may also send an email to [info@christies.com](mailto:info@christies.com) and request that your email address be removed from our lists.

_Business Relationships_

The Christie's sites contain links to other Web sites. None of the information that you provide to us will be transmitted to other Web sites. Christie's is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

_Cookies_

Christie's may also use on its Internet properties a personalization technology called a "cookie." A cookie is a small text file placed on your computer's hard disk that identifies your browser software to a Web site. Cookies allow us to track when you enter, leave, and re-enter our sites and what path you take through our sites. In doing this, we can provide you with a more personalized experience.

_LotFinder ®_

Christie's provides users of this site the opportunity to inform others (each, a "recipient") about a sale or lot for sale, which will require the sender to provide the recipient's email address(es). At the sender's request, Christie's will automatically send the recipient email on behalf of the sender with a link to Christie's site containing the information about the sale or lot. Christie's will not initiate any further contact with the recipient, beyond the email sent on behalf of the sender, unless the recipient specifically "subscribes" for extra services by filling out a registration form.

If you, as a recipient, do not wish to receive further e-mail from the sender, please reply to the sender requesting they stop sending you the email in the future. Christie's does not accept responsibility for any third party's use (or misuse) of this service.
