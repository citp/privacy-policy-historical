# Privacy Policy, Compliance, and Disclosures - Christopher S. Penn Marketing Blog

[Pursuant to new FTC regulations](https://www.christopherspenn.com/youve-discovered-the-missing-link/2015/06/ftc-endorsement-guidelines-what-agencies-need-to-know/), I’ve put up this handy, all-encompassing page of disclosures so that it’s perfectly clear when I’m writing on behalf of someone else.

## **People Who Employ Me**

I am co-founder and co-owner of [Trust Insights](https://www.trustinsights.ai/). All content which features Trust Insights inherently provides me direct and indirect financial benefit. Clients I represent through Trust Insights will be marked or tagged as clients for disclosure purposes.

## **People Who Consult With Me**

Various conferences and [events](https://www.christopherspenn.com/events/) pay me to speak. If I’m promoting a conference that I’m speaking at, assume I’m being paid to speak and that any promotion of the conference isn’t vain egotism, but is in fact crass commercialism.

  * I am an IBM Champion, which means I receive recognition from IBM and non-financial compensation.



## **Financial Holdings and Conflicts of Interest**

  * I am an investor in T-Mobile (TMUS).
  * I am an investor in IBM (IBM).
  * I hold a variety of index funds for retirement purposes, including an S&P 500 Index Fund, managed by USAA Investment Corporation.
  * I hold four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin.
  * I am a paid advisor of Narrative Network and the NRVE cryptocurrency token.



## **Statement on Affiliate Marketing**

**I’m going to try to make money off of you**. Let me repeat that. **I AM GOING TO TRY TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF YOU.** I’ll post stuff for sale on which I get paid a commission. I’ll post stuff for my employer to benefit my salary, so assume a bias there. I use [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&tag=affiliatemarketingcspblog-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325), Linkshare, Commission Junction, [Shareasale](https://www.trustinsights.ai/shareasale), and anyone else who will shovel cash my way. You should too. **Assume that I’m getting paid by someone** , though I’ll use in-post disclosures when and where I can.

**_My only promise to you is that I won’t market crap to you. If I try to sell you something, at least it’ll be the good stuff._**

## **Statement on Content**

This is my blog. It’s like my living room, only online. I do with it as I like, as you should do in your own living room. If you were to come into my living room, demand free beer and chips, then crap on the floor and break the windows, I’d probably put your porch lights out, if you know what I mean. If you do the digital equivalent, I’ll do the same.

Plain English: I reserve the right to do whatever I want on my personal blog with content, including updating, editing, and deleting without warning or notice.

## **Statement on Unsolicited Items**

You’re welcome to send them to me, but they’re not coming back. Ever. Especially if the cat gets to it.

By sending me something to review, you understand that I may or may not review it, and I do not guarantee any outcome of the review. I also do not guarantee a review in a timely manner unless you want to pay for a review.

If your product sucks, I’m going to say so in no uncertain words.

If it’s delivered electronically, I may never even see it due to spam filters.

If it’s tangible, there’s a distinct chance it’ll get lost in my office somewhere and I won’t find it until months later, possibly after you’ve gone out of business. I’ll still review it and lament your passing if that’s the case.

If I do review something, I will disclose it, no exceptions.

If it’s great, I’ll tell people about it.  
If it’s terrible, likewise.  
If it’s mediocre, there’s a good chance it will make so little an impression that I’ll forget to review it entirely.

Be awesome, okay?
