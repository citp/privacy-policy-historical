The personal information that we collect is used for providing and improving our websites and making the Bible understandable and accessible.

**Information We Collect and How We Collect It**

When using our websites, if you would like to access some features of our websites, for example creating a journal entry or commenting, you have to create an account. If you choose to create an account, you will need to share certain information, such as name, email and country.

We collect information from you in several different ways on our websites. Our goal in collecting this information is to provide you an efficient, meaningful, and customized experience. We may collect personal information, including IP address, if you visit our websites, if you make a donation, purchase or other transaction involving a payment from you to us on our websites. Some examples of when we ask for and collect your personal information include:

  1. **When creating an account on our websites.** When creating an account you will provide your name, e-mail and/or mailing address and may also elect to provide preference and interest-based information. This allows us to send you updates, contact you regarding announcements, system updates, new ministry products and offerings, and other information.
  2. **Contact Us.** We use Contact Us forms located on various areas of our websites to allow you to contact us directly with any questions, comments, or requests you may have. This information is used to respond to your questions, comments, and requests.
  3. **Email Registration.** You have the opportunity to receive regular emails while visiting our websites. When signing up for email you may be asked to provide certain details, such as email address, name, country, and preferences. Information provided will be used to deliver email to you, personalize your experience and to improve and enhance what we offer.

If at one time you signed up for email but no longer wish to be a part of that email list, you may unsubscribe at anytime by clicking Unsubscribe within the email.
  4. **Mobile Apps.** We offer various apps for mobile devices, including phone and tablets. Full access to all the features within the applications (including commenting, journaling, and bookmarks), will require the creation of an account.

  * **Unbounce:** A website testing tool that allows us to test multiple ideas at the same time to select number of visitors. For example, we may want to test a different button color to a small group of visitors and see how it performs before having all visitors use it.
  * **State and Federal Agencies:  **We may also need to furnish donor information to state or federal agencies in accordance with applicable statutes.

**Security and Technical Issues**

Protecting your privacy and your information is something we take very seriously. We implement industry standard security safeguards designed to protect your data.

We may use your data and communications if we think it is necessary for security purposes or to investigate possible fraud or violations of the law or this Privacy Policy and/or attempts to harm others.

**Links to Other Sites**

Some of our websites may contain links to other sites. We provide these links as a convenience to you and if you click on any of those links, you will be directed to that site. These external sites are not owned or operated by us. We would strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of those websites. We do not endorse, have any control over, and assume no responsibility, for the content, privacy policies or practices of any external sites or services. If you decide to use any of these links, you are doing so entirely at your own risk.
