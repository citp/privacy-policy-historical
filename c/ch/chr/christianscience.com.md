Our policy regarding this information is simple: We will not sell, trade, rent to or share with third parties any of your personal information without your permission. As an exception, to protect Site visitors and the general welfare, christianscience.com will release personal information about its users when the law requires us to do so. The personal information you submit when registering is available to be seen by members of the forum.

If you submit your e-mail address, we will use it to send you information about online events, Site updates, activities, and products of this Site and its affiliates. All such communications will provide you the opportunity to unsubscribe or “opt-out” from receiving such communications.

Christianscience.com and its affiliates may use, reproduce, distribute, and display in whole or in part, in any media, with or without name attribution, the statements, questions or comments you submit through forums and/or the “Contact Us” page.

We do collect anonymous, aggregated data for statistical purposes. We may use such information to help determine ways to improve our Site and may share this unattributable information with our affiliates.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding what is done with your information or would like such information deleted from our records, please e-mail us at [ info@christianscience.com](mailto:info@christianscience.com).

### What are cookies? How do you use them?

A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from christianscience.com’s Web server and is stored on your computer’s hard drive. Christianscience.com uses cookies to keep and sometimes track information about you in order to deliver better and more personalized services. Cookies allow us to access your registration information, which is stored on our computers, to anonymously identify which areas of our Site you have visited. Once you log out of christianscience.com forums, the cookie will be deleted and another cookie will be used at your next session. Our Site sponsors, advertisers, or linked Sites may use cookies, too. Christianscience.com does not own or control these entities or Sites, and this statement of policy does not cover how these companies user their cookies.

### Is the information you collect about me secure?

We take precautions to protect our visitors’ information. When you submit sensitive information via the Web Site, your information is protected both online and offline from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, and unlawful destruction or accidental loss.

### What about children using your Site — is their privacy protected?

Yes. In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), this Site does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent. If it is learned that such information has been collected without parental consent, that information will be deleted from the Site’s database as quickly as practical or the child’s parent(s) will be contacted to obtain consent for the collection of the information.

We strongly encourage parents to get involved with their children’s online usage and to be aware of activities in which they are participating.

### What about my privacy on linked Sites?

This Web Site contains links to other Sites and to affiliated Sites which have their own privacy policies. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this Web Site.

By using this Web Site, you consent to the collection and usage of information as described in this policy. This privacy policy is subject to change without notice and such changes will be updated and reflected within our privacy statement.
