Because protecting your privacy is very important to us at ChristianityToday.com (a service of Christianity Today International), we have established a policy to safeguard your personal information, and we are committed to protecting its confidentiality. Our Internet sites collect no personally identifiable information about you except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information.

E-mail Addresses  
When you provide us your e-mail address we will not rent, sell, or exchange your e-mail address with a third party for any purpose. You may unsubscribe to any one of our e-mail newsletters by following the unsubscribe information found at the end of each newsletter.

We will occasionally try to contact you regarding special offers and promotions for CTI resources that we think you would find valuable. You may request to no longer receive special e-mail offers from use by following the opt-out instructions found in any offer.

Sporadically, we may also attempt to collect demographic data from you (e.g., job title, age, etc.). This information is used by our editors to better understand our visitors, and by our advertisers to target their advertisements. It is not required and should be submitted at your discretion.

Requests for Magazines, Products or Services  
When you request a magazine, product or service from us, we need to collect and store your name, address, and other basic personally identifiable information to provide you with the requested product or service and for billing purposes. Collecting your name and address will also enable us to offer you, by direct mail, products from Christianity Today International and other select sources that we think would be of interest to you. After receiving the product or service requested, you may "opt-out" of receiving these direct mail offers by sending an e-mail stating your request to opt-out along with your complete name, mailing address, and the name of the Christianity Today International magazine, product, or service you receive to [CTIFulfill@ChristianityToday.com](mailto:CTIFulfill@christianitytoday.com). This information is necessary so we can accurately process your request.

Your e-mail address will be obtained during the online ordering process for the purpose of corresponding with you about your purchase and to occasionally notify you of additional online shopping opportunities. You may opt-out of receiving any subsequent shopping opportunities by following the unsubscribe information found in each e-mail announcement. Again, we will not rent, sell, or exchange your e-mail address with a third party for any purpose.

Credit Card Safety  
Ordering online with us is a secure transaction. All online transactions in the ChristianityToday.com Store are handled with industry-standard SSL encryption. This means that when you enter your credit card number into the order form, it is transmitted across the Internet in an encrypted (scrambled) form, then decoded when it gets to us.

Kids and Teens  
Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send us any information about yourself. Do not post your full name, address, phone number, or school name on any message board or in any chat room.

Parents  
Any information collected by ChristianityToday.com from children under 18 is used only for the purpose of delivering the requested product or service. This information will not be shared with a third party for any reason.

Other Entities  
Companies that are independent from Christianity Today International operate many of the online areas that you visit via links from ChristianityToday.com. Although Christianity Today International will seek to require that these independent companies (e.g., information providers, including advertisers and merchants) adhere to our strong privacy principles, Christianity Today International does not bear responsibility for their policies or actions.

Christianity Today International reserves the right to cooperate with law enforcement officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities of our customers related to electronic communication transmitted on our site. Christianity Today International will have no legal liability for such disclosures.
