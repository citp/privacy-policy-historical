CB provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue to use the Services and the choices we offer for you to manage the information we collect related to the use of the Services. Each time that you access or use Services, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy or [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use.php) which govern your use of our Services, please discontinue accessing or using the Services.

**1\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

You can browse our Services without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information including but not limited to your name, email address, phone number, mobile telephone number, debit or credit card information or physical contact information about yourself. If you create an account or purchase any of our products or Services, you choose to give us your personal information and are not anonymous to us. When you create an account or use certain of our Services or otherwise engage with our Services, you may provide certain additional information such as username. You may also provide payment information such as credit or debit card information, name and billing address. 

You may give us your personal information so we can send you communications you request. Details of how you can opt-out of receiving any promotional communications from us are detailed in the section headed Choice and Opt-out.

When using our Services or third party social networking services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google +) (each and collectively, a "Social Network"), you will have the option to connect your activity on our Services with your Social Network information and activity. If you permit a connection between a Social Network and our Services we (and that Social Network) may be able to identify you and to associate information received from the connection with information we already have about you. Please review the Social Network’s privacy policy and choices for sharing information of any Social Network connected to our Services. 

From time-to-time we may request information from you and other users via surveys, contests, sweepstakes or other promotions. Participation in these surveys, contests, sweepstakes or other promotions is completely voluntary. Contact information may be used as set forth in this Privacy Policy and as set forth in the applicable official rules, to notify the winners and award prizes and file winners’ information as required by law. Survey information will be used for the purposes of the survey. 

Any information or content you post when participating with the Services, Social Networks, plug ins or other applications becomes public information, depending upon your privacy settings, and is subject to redistribution by CB and other third parties. There is no expectation of privacy when posting content or otherwise participating in interactive forums and we have no control over how those users may use the information you make public. Therefore, you should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting. 

We may collect additional information from you if you access Services through a mobile device, for example your unique device identifier, device operating system, mobile carrier, location or GPS/geo-location, and billing information which we may collect when you opt in for us to do so. When you use our Services we may request your permission to collect your location information. Please be advised some features will not be available if you choose not to provide your location data to us. However the degree to which your location can be identified depends on the device you are using (e.g. laptop, smartphone, tablet) and how you are connected to the internet (e.g. via cable broadband connection, Wi-Fi, etc.). If you enable location services for our Services we may collect location data periodically as you use or leave open our Services. We may also use this data internally or in conjunction with our third party service providers to customize your experience and provide offers that may be relevant to you. Depending on the platform you use to access our Services (e.g., Apple, iOS, Google, Android, Windows, etc.) you may be able to control from within the settings on your wireless device or the Service(s) whether location data is collected. 

From time to time you may choose to submit personal information about other people to invite them to share content on or use our Services. Inviting friends is always optional. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the Services, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend. 

The information we collect may be combined with information from outside records (e.g., demographic information, navigation information, additional contact information) that we have acquired in accordance with the law. We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to customize our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers that might be of interest and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.

We recommend that you check the privacy policies of those third party sites or applications to determine how your personal information will be utilized by the proprietors. 

We implement security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control, including to protect your data. SSL is encryption technology that helps safeguard your personally identifiable information against misuse by unauthorized individuals. However, despite our efforts, no system can completely guaranty that there will never be unauthorized access to your personal information, and your use of the Services indicates that you are willing to assume this risk. 

We do not represent or warrant that any of our Services is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Services do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations.

**EXAMPLES OF TRACKING TOOLS**

**Cookies**. A cookie is a data file placed on a device when it is used to visit the Services.  We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Services.  Cookies are stored on users' hard drives.  We use both "session ID cookies"; and "persistent cookies.";  Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Services and expire when the user closes his/her browser.  Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Services easier for returning users by remembering a user's login information.  Persistent cookies stay on a user's hard drive from one session to the next.  Flash cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.  Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.  Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please clickwww.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.  If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Services may not function properly.

**Web Beacons/GIFS**. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1×1 GIFs"; or "clear GIFs";) may be included in our web pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Services, to monitor how users navigate the Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.

**Embedded Scripts**. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device used to access Services from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

**HTML5**. We use HTML5 in some of our applications, including in our mobile website for the iPhone or iPad.  HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.  Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser "cookies"; file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites.  To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.

**e-tags/cache browers/web logs**. Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and device identification in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Services.  We may track your movement within the Services, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types.  This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our Services, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or device identification from the mobile device that you used to access our Services and usage and browsing habits.  We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our Services, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information.  We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.
