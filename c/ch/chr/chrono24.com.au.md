**7.** **Cookies**

Cookies help in many different ways to make your visit to our Platform easier, more comfortable and more intuitive. Cookies are alpha-numerical information files that your web browser automatically stores on the hard drive of your computer when you visit our internet site. Cookies do not harm your computer’s hard drive.

We use cookies in order to be able to identify you as a registered user without your having to log in separately, for example. The use of the cookies does not allow us to receive new personal data about you as an online visitor. The majority of internet browsers accept cookies automatically. However, you can configure your browser to reject cookies or to notify you whenever you receive a new cookie.

Third-party service providers, including Google, also use stored cookies in order to place adverts on websites on the basis of your previous visits to this website. You may revoke your consent to the collection and storage of data at any time with effect for the future.

As an alternative to changing the settings on your browser, you can also opt out from the use of cookies for interest-based advertising by Google at [www.google.de/settings/ads](http://www.google.de/settings/ads). More information on this is available at [www.google.de/privacy/ads](http://www.google.de/privacy/ads). You can also find additional information on Google terms and conditions at [www.google.com/intl/de/privacy](http://www.google.com/intl/de/privacy). 

Alternatively, you can opt out from the use of cookies by third-party service providers by accessing the opt-out page of the Network Advertising Initiative at [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

Deactivation of cookies can lead to your not being able to use all of the functions of our Platform. More information on deactivating cookies can be found at: [http://www.meine-cookies.org](http://www.meine-cookies.org/). 

**8.** **Links**

This data privacy policy does not cover websites that are linked to from our website. We do not have any influence over whether our data privacy and security standards are upheld by these sites. The operators of linked sites are solely responsible for the content thereof.

**9.** **Web analysis services**

**a.** **General information**

To shape our website according to needs and to continually optimize our service, we use web analysis services (“Google Universal Analytics” by Google Inc. and “MobileAppTracking by Tune”). Within this context, pseudonymized usage profiles are created and small text files that are saved on your computer (“cookies”) are used. The information collected by the cookie on your use of this website such as

  * browser type/version,
  * operating system used,
  * referrer URL (the page visited previously),
  * host name of the accessing computer (IP address),
  * time of server access,



is transmitted to a server in the US and stored there. The information is used to evaluate use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide further services associated with website and Internet use for the purposes of market research and needs-based design of these web pages. This information may also be forwarded to third parties as appropriate, insofar as this is prescribed by law or insofar as these parties process the data on behalf of the commissioning party. On no account will your IP address be linked with other data of the service providers. IP addresses are anonymized to exclude all possibility of such association (IP masking).

The user can prevent the installation of cookies by adjusting his/her browser accordingly; however, we must point out that in this case not all functions of the web site may be available to the user to their full extent.

Alternatively, the providers of the web analysis services offer various options to prevent the information generated by the cookie from being collected and further processed. You can find more information on the various options in Section 9.d).

**b.** **Hotjar**

We also use Hotjar, a web analysis service by Hotjar Ltd., Level 2, St Julians Business Centre, 3, Elia Zammit Street, St. Julians STJ 1000, Malta. In this context, cookies are placed. The cookies are automatically deleted after 365 days. You can find an overview of the cookies used [here](http://docs.hotjar.com/docs/cookies-stored-by-hotjar). 

The information recorded by the cookies is transferred to servers in the Europe and stored there. The information is used to record anonymously the behavior of visitors to our website. Mouse movements and clicks, for example, are recorded. This does not apply to recording key strokes when entering passwords or payment data. The evaluation of the information is used to provide a more user-friendly website design. 

Recording and evaluating the information does not allow us to identify you personally. The information is anonymized through the use of the so-called UUID (Universally Unique Identifier). This allows us to identify repeat visitors to our website without being able to personally identify the person. 

Your data is not passed on to third parties except where there is a statutory obligation to pass on the details or if the data is processed for us by a third party (e.g. in a computer center). 

If you do not want Hotjar to record your behavior on our website, in addition to changing the corresponding cookie settings in your browser, you can disable JavaScript in your browser. 

More detailed information on data privacy when using Hotjar can also be found in the [Hotjar Privacy Policy](https://www.hotjar.com/privacy). 

**c.** **“Google Universal Analytics”**

Apart from cookie-based web analysis, we also use the analysis tool “Google Universal Analytics”, within the scope of which we allocate a unique user ID to every user upon registration or initial log-in. This user ID together with the behavior of the user on our platform – with, however, no reference to any of the user’s personal data – is forwarded to the Google servers. Google subsequently evaluates this user behavior on our behalf and compiles reports on user activity in order to provide further services associated with website and Internet use for the purposes of market research and needs-based design of our web pages. If IP addresses are collected during this evaluation, these shall be anonymized in such a way that the identity of the user cannot be determined.

We personally create no user profiles from the reports received by Google Inc. that would enable specific users and their personal data to be identified.

**d.** **“Google Analytics Advertising Features”**

We use Google Analytics Advertising Features to support display advertising. Apart from the Google Analytics cookie, another double-click cookie is set for this purpose. In addition to the anonymized data on user activity, demographics and interests data are also collected with the double-click cookie. Google evaluates this data on our behalf and draws up remarketing lists on the basis of specific behavioral data, demographics and interests data. Google shares these lists with AdWords. Demographics and interests data are also used by Google on our behalf to prepare analytics report and segments.

We personally create no user profiles from the reports received by Google Inc. that would enable specific users and their personal data to be identified.

**e.** **Objection**

The user can object to the creation of usage profiles at any time.

To do so, please follow the instructions ofthe providers of the web analysis services used by us:

  * You may object to the use of Google Universal Analytics at <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de>
  * You may object to the use of MobileAppTracking by Tune at <http://optoutmobile.com/optout/index.html>
  * You may object to the use of Hotjar by the installation and use of a browser add-on such as [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/), for example.



We use the Crashlytics tool to analyze why our app crashes and to improve its stability. According to the provider, no personal data are collected or transferred. Only real-time crash reports stating the time of the crash and information on receiver and location are transmitted. Please observe the data privacy policy of the provider <http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf>. 

**10.** **Social media plugins**

**a.** **Facebook**

We use social plugins from Facebook on our website. To do this, we use the "Like" or "Share" button. This is a service provided by the US company Facebook Inc. (1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA).

If you visit a page on our website containing such a plugin, your browser will create a direct connection to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin will be directly transferred to your browser by Facebook and integrated into the website by the browser.

When the plugin is integrated, Facebook will be informed that your browser has visited the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a Facebook account or are not logged into Facebook at the time. This information (including your IP address) is transferred directly to a Facebook server in the USA by your browser and stored there.

If you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can directly match your visit to our website with your Facebook account. When you interact with the plugins, for example by pressing the “Like” or “Share” button, the corresponding information is also transferred directly to a Facebook server and stored there. The information will also be published on Facebook and displayed to your Facebook friends.

Facebook can use this information for the purposes of advertising, market research and needs-based design of Facebook pages. Facebook creates usage, interest and relationship profiles, for example in order to evaluate your use of our website in terms of the advertisements integrated into your Facebook profile, to inform other Facebook users of your activity on our website, and to provide further services associated with your use of Facebook.

If you do not want Facebook to be able to match data collected via our website with your Facebook account, you must first log out of Facebook before visiting our website.

The purpose and scope of data collection and further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as the related rights and settings options for protecting your privacy, can be viewed in [[Facebook’s data privacy policy]](http://www.facebook.com/policy.php). 

**b.** **Twitter**

We have also integrated plugins from the messaging network Twitter Inc. (795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA) into our web pages. The Twitter plugins (“tweet” button) can be recognized by the Twitter logo on our pages. An overview of the “tweet” button can be found [[here]](http://dev.twitter.com/). If you visit a page on our website containing such a plugin, a direct connection is created between your browser and the Twitter server. Twitter will be informed that you have visited our site from your IP address. If you click on the Twitter “tweet” button while logged into your Twitter account, you can link the content of our site to your Twitter profile. Twitter can therefore match your visit to our site with your user account. We would like to point out that we, as the provider of the site, have no knowledge of the content of the transferred data or its use by Twitter. More information on this can be found in [[Twitter’s data privacy policy]](http://twitter.com/privacy). 

If you do not want Twitter to be able to match your visit to our site with your account, please log out of your Twitter user account.

**c.** **Google+**

Our website uses the +1 button of the social network Google+, which is operated by Google Inc. (“Google”), Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. The button can be recognized by the “g+1” symbol on a white or colored background.

When you access one of our website pages that contains such a button, a direct connection is established between your browser and the Google servers. The content of the “+1” button is transmitted directly to your browser by Google and integrated by it into the website. We have, therefore, no influence on the scope of the data collected by Google with the button. According to Google, if you do not click on the button, no personal data are collected. Only the data, including the IP address, of those users who are logged in, are collected and processed.

Find more information on the purpose and extent of data collection as well as the further processing and use of data by Google, your rights with regard to the above and settings to protect your privacy in [[Google’s data privacy policy]](http://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/). 

If you are a Google+ user and do not want Google to collect data on your person via our website and link it with your Google membership details, you must log out of Google+ before visiting our website.
