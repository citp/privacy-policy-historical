**Advertisement tracking**

We use cookies and pixel tags to make our advertising and promotions on third party websites more effective. We use third party vendors like Google, who show our ads on sites across the internet.

We allow the third parties who participate with us in marketing programmes to place cookies when you visit our site. These cookies enable us to monitor which adverts you see and click on to get to our site, and help us to deliver adverts more relevant to your personal interests. They also limit the amount of times you see an advert and measure the effectiveness of adverts. This means you won't see the same adverts over and over, or continue to see irrelevant adverts. We currently work with the following companies for this; please see their privacy policies at the following addresses:

  * Doubleclick/Google Adwords: <http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/>
  * Cybercom/Google Adsense: <http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/>
  * LinkShare: <http://www.linkshare.co.uk/cookies/>



These cookies are as safe as the ones used whilst you browse our site – none of these third parties collects any personal data from which they would be able to identify individual customers. Quite often, targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organizations that generate the advert. When one of these adverts is presented to you on a site there will be a quick and easy way to click in and opt out of receiving further adverts.
