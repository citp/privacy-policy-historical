**Information We Collect and How We Use It  
**  
You may choose to provide personal information (such as your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address) on this website.  Here are the ways you may provide the information and the types of information you may submit.  We also tell you how we may use the information. **E-mail Communications  
**  
When you ask us to send you e-mail such as our free e-mail newsletter, you may provide us with certain information like your e-mail address so we can fulfill your request.  You may choose to provide additional information as well, such as your postal address and phone number. 

 **Send a Post Card to a Friend** If you take advantage of our Send a Post Card to a Friend feature, we ask for your friend’s and your first name and e-mail addresses.  We use your friend’s name and e-mail address only to send the information you requested we forward.  We don’t keep your friend’s e-mail address or use it for any other purpose. **Donations** When you make a donation through our website (for example, by sponsoring a child), we may ask you to submit certain personal information (such as credit card information) so we can process your donation.  We use the credit card information you provide only to fulfill the transaction you requested.  We maintain that information in our customer service records in the event you choose to make another donation later.  We also maintain your contact information in our records so we can contact you to provide CCF program information and information on additional giving opportunities.  **Questionnaires and Surveys  
**  
We occasionally may ask visitors to our website to complete online surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests.  These surveys help us understand the needs of our visitors.  We do not keep any personal information about you in connection with your participation in a website survey unless you specifically agree to provide this information.   
**  
Contests and Games**

Our site occasionally may contain notices of contests or games we are conducting, which you may enter electronically in some cases.  We use the information you provide to conduct the contest or game (for example, to contact you if you are a winner).  We won’t use the information you provided to enter the contest or game for any other purpose unless you’ve agreed otherwise.   
**  
Contact CCF**

You may choose to contact us through our website.  We provide online forms so you may, for example, (1) ask a question, (2) update your address or (3) request more information.  We use the information you provide on these forms to fulfill your request.  We use the information you provide to respond to your inquiries.   
**  
Cookies and Web Beacons  
**  
When you visit our website, your browser automatically sends us certain Internet-related information (such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you’re using).  We also may use cookies and Web beacons to better understand how visitors use our site.  
Cookies are small text files that websites often store on the computer hard drives of visitors to their sites.  A cookie contains a unique code, which is used to recognize your computer when a user of your computer returns to a website that was visited previously.  Web beacons are Internet tools that help us determine, for example, whether a website page has been viewed.  We use cookies and Web beacons to enhance the online experience of our visitors and to better understand how our site is used.  Cookies and Web beacons may tell us, for example, whether you have visited our site before or whether you are a new visitor.  
The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies.  Remember, though, without cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of CCF’s website features.  
**  
Information We Share  
**  
CCF does not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal information about our website visitors, except as described here.  We share information provided by our website visitors with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf for example, to process donations.  These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.  In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, (ii) in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.   
We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.  Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided through this website in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.  
**  
Links to Other Sites  
**  
Occasionally we provide links to other websites for your convenience and information.  These sites operate independently from our site and are not under our control.  These sites may have their own privacy notices in place, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked websites.  We are not responsible for the content of these sites, any products or services that may be offered through these sites, or any other use of these sites.  
**  
Security  
**  
We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized disclosure, use, alteration or destruction of the personal information in our possession.  When you provide credit card information to make a donation, we use the industry standard for Internet security -- Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology -- to help protect the information you provide.  This Internet encryption standard scrambles data as it travels from your computer to our server.  Please note, however, that perfect security does not exist on the Internet.  You’ll know that you’re in a secure area of our website when a “lock” icon appears on your screen and the “http” portion of our URL address changes to “https.”  The “s” stands for “secure.”   
**

Updates to this Privacy Notice
