###  What are "cookies" and how does RealCafes.com use them? 

In addition to the information described above that RealCafes.com collects, we also collect information "anonymously" using "cookies." A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a Web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the Web site may identify you and track your activities on the Web site. This unique number identifies your browser-- but not you -- to RealCafes.com computers whenever you visit the Service. A cookie will not let a Web site know any personally identifiable information about you, such as your real name and address. RealCafes.com does not collect personally identifiable information about any one person using cookies. Because cookies are only text files, they cannot run on your computer, search your computer for other information, or transmit any information to anyone. RealCafes.com generally uses cookies to determine in what state your computer workstation is located. Third party advertising networks for RealCafes.com may issue cookies when serving advertisements.

RealCafes.com and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the Double Click cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on a visitor's past visits to ChristianCafe.com. This is done in the form of Remarketing. Remarketing is used to advertise online to visitors who visit ChristianCafe.com. These ads are shown across the Internet, utilizing Display Advertising features of Google Analytics. Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the [Ad Preferences Manager](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/). An opt-out [browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) is also available. 

The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and you will find them used on most major Web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you have received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that while RealCafes.com does not require you to use cookies, certain areas of the Service will not function properly if you set your browser to not accept cookies. For example, you may have difficulty searching the Service, completing the Service questionnaire, and paying for your Service subscription.
