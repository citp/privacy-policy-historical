_This Web Site, as defined below, is maintained by C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.’s ©1998-2016. Content on this site may not be used for commercial benefit without expressed written consent of C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc._

C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., and its affiliates and subsidiaries and each of their directors, officers, employees, and authorized representative (collectively, "C.H. Robinson") respect your privacy. This Global Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information we collect, how we use the information, with whom we share it, and the choices you can make about our use of the information. We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of the information and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.

Robinson's inability to provide you with the information or services you desire.

### Information We Share

We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information we collect about you, except as described herein or otherwise disclosed to you at the time the data is collected.

We share information to perform activities that you request. For example, we may share the personal information we collect with our affiliates, or to cooperate with an authorized law enforcement or regulatory investigation. In addition, we may share personal information with other third parties with the consent of the individual to whom the information pertains.

If you are performing services directly or indirectly for us and using an application provided by us, then we may collect information for the purpose of providing information to our carriers and customers.

We may also share your personal information with third-party vendors that perform tasks on our behalf and under our instruction. These third-party vendors may use your personal information only in connection with the services they perform on our behalf and they are bound to protect your personal information in a manner consistent with our own policies and practices.

On our Web Sites, you may have an opportunity to post user-generated content using social networking tools available on those sites. If you take advantage of this opportunity, remember that the user-generated content you post is available to others who visit the Web Site and therefore you should have no expectation of privacy with respect to such content. In addition, you may choose to use certain features on our Web Sites for which we partner with other entities. These features, which may include social networking and geographic location tools, are operated by third parties that are not affiliated with C.H. Robinson. These third parties may use personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. On sites on which these features are offered, the relevant third parties are identified. We strongly suggest you review the third parties' privacy policies if you use the relevant features.

We may also disclose information about you when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, a court order, or a subpoena. We may also disclose information about you to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to protect the security of our Web Sites; to enforce or apply our Web Sites' terms of use or other agreements; or to protect our own rights or property or the rights, property or safety of our users or others.

We also reserve the right to transfer information about you to a successor organization if, for example, we transfer the ownership or operation of one of our Web Sites to another organization or if we merge with another organization. If such a transfer occurs, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner consistent with this policy. Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.

### Your Rights and Choices

You may have certain rights regarding the personal information we maintain about you. We offer you certain choices about what personal information we collect from you, how we use that information, and how we communicate with you.

You may refrain from submitting information directly to us, although doing so may impact our ability to provide the products, services, and information you request and/or affect your ability to use applications software.

You may elect not to have a unique cookie identification number assigned to your computer to avoid aggregation and analysis of data collected on our Web Sites. Generally, if you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit our Web Sites, you may be unable to use all of the functionality of our sites if your browser rejects our cookies.

We typically offer you an opportunity to choose whether you want receive certain communications from us, generally by offering an "opt in" or an "opt out," depending on applicable law, when you first provide contact information through one of our Web Sites. In addition, we will include an "unsubscribe" link in each electronic newsletter or promotional e-mail we send you, so that you can inform us that you do not wish to receive such communications from us in the future.

When accepting the terms of use/end user license agreement for applications software, you must opt in to collection of data from your mobile device in order for the applications software to work properly.

If you are located in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, you may direct us not to share your personal information with third parties, except (i) with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf, (ii) in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets, (iii) if disclosure is required by law or legal process, (iv) with law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (v) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraud or other illegal activity. If you are located in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, we use your personal information only for the purposes indicated in this policy unless we have a legal basis, such as consent, to use it for other purposes. Where required by law, C.H. Robinson obtains your prior opt-in consent at the time of collection for the processing of (i) personal information for marketing purposes and (ii) personal information deemed sensitive pursuant to applicable law.

Subject to applicable law, you may have the right to request access to and receive information about the personal data we maintain about you, update and correct inaccuracies in your personal data, and have the information blocked or deleted, as appropriate. We will respond to such requests within a reasonable time and, in any case, within the time limits established by applicable law. We may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. In most cases, we will provide access and correct or delete any inaccurate information you discover. In some cases, however, we may limit or deny your request if the law permits or requires us to do so or if we are unable to verify your identify.

### Data Transfers

We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected.

### How We Protect Personal Information

We maintain reasonable administrative, physical and technological measures to protect the confidentiality and security of information about you.

Robinson never collects information for third party commercial marketing purposes nor does it create individual profiles or provide your information to any third party organization. C.H. Robinson will only share your information with third parties when and as you request or as otherwise required by law.

Our Web Sites may provide links to other sites for your convenience and information. These sites may operate independently from C.H. Robinson. Linked sites may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review. In addition, a link to a non-C.H. Robinson site does not mean that C.H. Robinson endorses or accepts any responsibility for the content, or the use, of such site. It is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever you select for your use is free of such items as viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other items of a destructive nature. C.H. Robinson is not liable for the privacy practices or the content of other sites and to the extent any linked sites you visit are not owned or controlled by C.H.
