PRIVACY POLICY** |   
|  |   
| **Policy Effective Date: This policy became effective on April 18, 2006.** |   
|  |   
|  |   
| At Christmas Tree Shops we are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers, which is why we do not sell or rent any personal identifiable information regarding our customers to any third party. We hope the policy below will answer all of your questions regarding how we treat information gathered from visitors to christmastreeshops.com. Feel free to e-mail us at [bargains@christmastreeshops.com ](mailto:bargains@christmastreeshops.com) with any questions you might have. |

| **What Information We Collect** |   
|  |   
|  |   
| In order to process your order efficiently, we collect the following information: name, billing address, shipping address, e-mail address, phone number, and credit card number ("Personal Information") when you place an order with us. We also may periodically conduct surveys of visitors to our Web site. This helps us better understand what our customers would like to see from us. We use this information for internal marketing research purposes. We may contact a visitor who responded to a survey for more information, but only if that visitor has told us that they don't mind being contacted.

With respect to emails that you may receive from us, we capture data related to the opening and click-through from these emails. This information is used for internal Christmas Tree Shops review and analysis only.

| **How to Opt-out** |   
|  |

Encrypted information cannot be read or recorded as it travels over the Internet. You can tell you are sending information securely by the unbroken key icon or closed lock icon that should appear at the bottom of your internet browser's window (depending on what browser you use). These icons will appear when you are placing an order on our Web site.
