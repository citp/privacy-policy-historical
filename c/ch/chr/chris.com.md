Our objective in participating in this program is to display ads that are of interest to you and to make our website more interesting for our users.

(2) In order to display advertisements, statistical information about you is collected and then processed by our advertising partners. When you visit our website, Amazon receives the information that you visited the corresponding page of our website. In addition, Amazon assesses your needs via web beacons and may also store a cookie on your computer. The data mentioned under Section 3 of this Policy are transmitted. We have no influence on the data that are collected, and the full scope of the data collection and the storage period are not known to us. When you are logged into Amazon, your data can be directly allocated to your Amazon account. If you do not want your data to be allocated to your Amazon profile, you must log out. Your data may possibly be transferred to Amazon’s contractual partners and to authorities.

2\. Use of Google Adwords Conversion Tracking

(1) We use the service of Google Adwords to draw attention to our attractive offers with the help of advertising material (Google Adwords) on external websites. Using the data of such ad campaigns, we can assess how successful the individual advertising measures are. Our objective for this is to display ads that are of interest to you, to make our website more interesting for you, and to attain a fair calculation of advertising costs.

(2) This advertising material is delivered by Google via “ad servers.” In addition, we use ad server cookies, which allow us to measure certain parameters of success, such as the display of ads or clicks by users. If you reach our website via a Google ad, Google Adwords will store a cookie on your PC. These cookies generally expire after 30 days and are not intended to identify you personally. As a rule, the unique cookie ID, the number of ad impressions per ad (frequency), the last impression (relevant for post-view conversions), and opt-out information (indication that the user does not wish to be addressed again) are stored as analytical values for this cookie.

(3) These cookies allow Google to recognize your Internet browser. If a user visits certain pages of an Adwords client’s website and the cookie stored on the user’s computer has not yet expired, Google and the client can recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was forwarded to this page. Each Adwords client is assigned a different cookie. Cookies can therefore not be traced via the websites of Adwords clients. We do not collect and process any personal data using the above-mentioned advertising. Google merely provides us with statistical evaluations. Based on these evaluations, we can recognize which of our implemented advertising measures are particularly effective. We do not receive additional data from the use of advertising material; in particular, we cannot identify users based on this information.

(4) As a result of the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with the Google server. We have no influence on the scope and the further use of the data that are collected by Google as a result of using this tool and are therefore providing you with the information at our disposal: the use of AdWords conversion tracking means that Google receives the information that you have visited the corresponding section of our website or have clicked on one of our ads. If you are registered with a service provided by Google, Google can allocate your visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or are not logged into your account, it is possible that the provider will recognize and store your IP address.

(5) There are several ways that can prevent your participation in this tracking process: a) by changing the settings of your browser software; in particular, by rejecting third-party cookies, you will not receive ads from third-party providers; b) by deactivating the cookies for conversion tracking by configuring your browser settings in such a way that cookies from the domain “www.googleadservices.com” are blocked, using https://www.google.de/settings/ads; these settings will be deleted when you delete your cookies; c) by deactivating the interest-related ads of providers who are part of the self-regulation campaign “About Ads” using the link http://www.aboutads.info/choices; these settings will be deleted when you delete your cookies; d) by means of a permanent deactivation in your Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Google Chrome browsers using the link http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin. Please note that if you do this, you may not be able to fully use all of the functions of this website.

(6) Legal basis for the processing of your data: Art. 6, para. 1, no. 1 (f) of the GDPR. Additional information regarding Google’s policies on data privacy can be found here: http://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy and https://services.google.com/sitestats/de.html.

Google is subject to the EU-US Privacy Shield, <https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework>.

3\. Remarketing

In addition to Adwords conversion tracking, we use the Google remarketing service. Remarketing is a process we use to remind you of our offers. By using this application, our ads can be displayed to you during your use of the Internet after you have visited our website. This is done by means of cookies that are stored on your browser and that Google uses to record and evaluate your user behavior when visiting various websites. This allows Google to determine when you previously visited our website. According to Google’s own statements, Google does not combine the data collected in the context of remarketing with personal data that Google may have stored in relation to you. In particular, according to Google, data are pseudonymized during remarketing.

4\. DoubleClick by Google

(1) This website also uses the online marketing tool DoubleClick by Google. DoubleClick uses cookies to display ads that are relevant to the user, to improve reports on the campaign’s success, or to avoid repeatedly showing the same ad to a particular user. Google uses a cookie ID to record which ads are displayed in which browser and can thus prevent this ad from being displayed multiple times. Furthermore, with the help of cookie IDs, DoubleClick can record “conversions” that are related to requests concerning ads. This is the case, for instance, when a user sees a DoubleClick ad and later visits the advertiser’s website and makes a purchase there using the same browser. According to Google, DoubleClick cookies do not contain personal data.

(2) As a result of the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with the Google server. We have no influence on the scope and the further use of the data that are collected by Google as a result of using this tool and are therefore providing you with the information at our disposal: the use of DoubleClick means that Google receives the information that you have visited the corresponding section of our website or have clicked on one of our ads. If you are registered with a service provided by Google, then Google can allocate your visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or are not logged into your account, it is possible that the provider will recognize and store your IP address.

(3) There are several ways to prevent your participation in this tracking process: a) by changing the settings of your browser software; in particular, by rejecting third-party cookies, you will not receive ads from third-party providers; b) by deactivating the cookies for conversion tracking by configuring your browser settings in such a way that cookies from the domain “www.googleadservices.com” are blocked, using https://www.google.de/settings/ads; these settings will be deleted when you delete your cookies; c) by deactivating the interest-related ads of providers who are part of the self-regulation campaign “About Ads” using the link http://www.aboutads.info/choices; these settings will be deleted when you delete your cookies; d) by means of a permanent deactivation in your Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Google Chrome browsers using the link http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin. Please note that if you do this, you may not be able to fully use all of the functions of this website.

(4) The legal basis for the processing of your data: Art. 6, para. 1, no. 1 (f) of the GDPR. Additional information regarding DoubleClick by Google can be found at https://www.google.de/doubleclick and http://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2839090; additional information regarding Google’s policies on data privacy, in general, can be found at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy. Alternatively, you can visit the website of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) at http://www.networkadvertising.org. Google is subject to the EU-US Privacy Shield, https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework.

5\. Facebook Custom Audiences

(1) In addition, our website uses the “Custom Audiences” remarketing tool of Facebook Inc. (“Facebook”). With this tool, interest-related ads (“Facebook Ads”) can be displayed to users of the website when they visit the social network Facebook or other websites that also use this tool. Our objective in using this tool is to display ads that are of interest to you and to thereby make our website more interesting for you.

(2) As a result of the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with the Facebook server. We have no influence on the scope and the further use of the data that are collected by Facebook as a result of using this tool and are therefore providing you with the information at our disposal: the use of Facebook Custom Audiences means that Facebook receives the information that you have visited the corresponding page of our website or have clicked on one of our ads. If you are registered with a service provided by Facebook, Facebook can allocate your visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Facebook or are not logged into your account, it is possible that the provider will recognize and store your IP address as well as other identifying factors.

(3) The “Facebook Custom Audiences” tool can be deactivated [here and] at [https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads#_](https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads#_m%C3%B6glich)if you are a registered user.

(4) Legal basis for the processing of your data: Art. 6, para. 1, no. 1 (f) of the GDPR. Additional information on data processing by Facebook can be found at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy.

6\. A/B Testing

(1) This website also analyzes user behavior by means of A/B testing. This means that we may display our website with slightly varying content depending on the profile that has been assigned to a user. In this way, we can analyze and regularly improve our website and make it more interesting for you as a user. Legal basis for the A/B testing: Art. 6, para. 1, no. 1 (f) of the GDPR.

7\. Integration of YouTube Videos

(1) Our website integrates YouTube videos that are stored at http://www.YouTube.com and can be played directly on our website.

(2) When you visit our website, YouTube receives the information that you visited the corresponding subpage of our website. In addition, the data mentioned under Section 3 of this Policy are transmitted. This occurs regardless of whether you have logged into a user account provided by YouTube or do not have a user account. When you are logged into Google, your data will be directly allocated to your account. If you do not want your data to be allocated to your profile in YouTube, you must log out before clicking the button. YouTube stores your data as a user profile and uses them for the purposes of advertising, market research, and/or to adapt its website to your needs. Such an evaluation is conducted, in particular (and even for users who are not logged in), to display appropriate advertising and to inform other users of the social network of your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the creation of such user profiles; you must contact YouTube if you wish to exercise this right.

(3) Additional information regarding the purpose and scope of the data collection and processing by YouTube can be found in their Privacy Policy, which also includes additional information regarding your rights and setting options to protect your privacy: https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy. Google also processes your personal data in the USA and is subject to the EU-US Privacy Shield, <https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework>.
