              <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
                Cookies are used to deliver content specific to a user's potential interests  and for the administration of passwords, among other purposes.&nbsp; For  example, we also may use cookies to ensure users do not see the same  advertisements and product offerings repeatedly.&nbsp; It is important to note  that cookies are not linked to Personal Information.&nbsp; Since our website is  specifically designed to your interests, disabling your browser from accepting  cookies will prevent you from accessing many of the features on  ChristianDatingForFree.com.&nbsp; </p>
              <p><strong>Your IP Address</strong><br>
                A user’s IP address is used by most e-commerce websites to collect demographic  data and improve service.&nbsp; We use your IP address, as well as the website  you visited prior to our website for much the same purpose.&nbsp; We  automatically gather this information after each visit and translate this  information into a resource that we can use to identify and correct problems  with our website and better understand our users, as well as continually update  and expand our offerings.&nbsp; </p>
              <p><strong>Limited Access to Personal Information</strong><br>
                Christian Dating For Free guards your Personal Information carefully.&nbsp; The  Personal Information that you provide will be used by Christian Dating For Free  to provide you with information about products and services available to you  through Christian Dating For Free and select partners.&nbsp; Christian Dating  For Free will not disclose Personal Information to non-affiliated third parties  without your permission.</p>
              <p>Upon your request, ChristianDatingForFree.com will share your Personal  Information with its affiliated representatives.&nbsp; For example, if you need  assistance in completing your profile, you may request that an affiliated  relationship consultant contact you to review your profile or provide other  assistance.&nbsp; Upon such a request, ChristianDatingForFree.com will forward  your name, phone number and other information you authorize to a relationship  consultant.&nbsp; Christian Dating For Free will not, however, forward any  Personal Information without your request to do so.</p>
              <p>Christian Dating For Free may share aggregate Personal Information collected  through ChristianDatingForFree.com with non-affiliated third parties.&nbsp;  Aggregate information does not identify you, but rather is based upon a summary  of information about all users.&nbsp; For example, we may tell an advertiser  that 10,000 users clicked on a specific link, and out of the 10,000 users, 35%  were from California.&nbsp; This aggregate information assists advertisers in  determining how they can best promote their products.&nbsp; We will not tell  our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements.<br>
                  <br>
                Christian Dating For Free will not disclose your Personal Information to  non-affiliated third parties without your permission unless we need to do so in  order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process or to  protect the personal safety of our users or the public.&nbsp; Christian Dating  For Free does not sell or rent Personal Information about its users to non-affiliated  third parties.&nbsp; If Christian Dating For Free intends to share your  Personal Information with a non-affiliated third party, we will do so only with  your knowledge and consent.<br>
  <br>
                In order to further enhance the safety of our services, Christian Dating For  Free uses third-party public records databases to perform criminal background  screenings and marriage verifications on our communicating members.&nbsp; These  third-party database providers use a limited amount of Personal Information to  run the criminal background screenings and marriage verifications, and do not  use your Personal Information for marketing purposes.&nbsp; Following the  background screenings and marriage verifications, Christian Dating For Free  receives a report of publicly available information from the database providers  that determine whether the member "passes" or "fails" the  criminal background screening and/or marriage verification process.</p>
              <p><strong>Security Procedures</strong><br>
                Christian Dating For Free recognizes how important and sensitive data is, and  that is why we have implemented policies and procedures to preserve the  security of your Personal Information.&nbsp; While Christian Dating For Free  strives to protect the Personal Information and email address you provide  through ChristianDatingForFree.com, no data transmission over the Internet can  be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp; As a result, while we strive to protect  your Personal Information, Christian Dating For Free cannot ensure or warrant  the security of any information you transmit to or receive from us through our  website and online services.&nbsp; ChristianDatingForFree.com operates secure  data networks that are password-protected and are not available to the  public.&nbsp; When transmitting information between you and  ChristianDatingForFree.com, data security is handled through a security  protocol called Secured Sockets Layer (SSL).&nbsp; SSL is an Internet security  standard using data encryption and Web server authentication.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Data encryption is the process of transforming legible information into a  complex arrangement of illegible information.&nbsp; The illegible data is made  legible only by a process called "decryption." A mathematical formula  known as a "key" is used to encrypt data when it is sent over the  Internet, and then to decrypt the data when it is received.&nbsp; SSL uses a  private/public key.&nbsp; Encryption strength is measured by the length of the  key used to encrypt the data; i.e., the longer the key, the more effective the  encryption.&nbsp; Using the SSL protocol, data transmission between you and the  ChristianDatingForFree.com server is performed at a standard level of  encryption strength.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>An SSL certificate is issued to ensure authentic and accurate identification  of a secured Web server.&nbsp; This translates into a digital ID, or electronic  fingerprint, that is included in the key used to encrypt the data.&nbsp; This  ensures that only the intended recipient, Christian Dating For Free, is able to  decrypt the data that you transmit.</p>
              <p>Christian Dating For Free reviews its security policies regarding  ChristianDatingForFree.com on a regular basis, and changes are made as  necessary.&nbsp; Only a select group of authorized individuals within Christian  Dating For Free have access to your Personal Information.&nbsp; </p>
              <p><strong>Managing Your Information</strong><br>
                Christian Dating For Free also understands that your circumstances and  preferences change.&nbsp; That is why we have simplified the process of  amending, updating or deleting your Personal Information.&nbsp; </p>
              <p><strong>Making Changes</strong><br>
                Your ChristianDatingForFree.com account information is password protected so  that only you have access to this Personal Information.&nbsp; You may update  this Personal Information and email address as necessary by clicking on the  appropriate edit option in the My Profile section, which allows you to access  and edit your account information, including your opt-in/opt-out choices.&nbsp; </p>
              <p><strong>Protecting Your Personal Information</strong><br>
                We strongly recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.&nbsp;  Christian Dating For Free will never ask you for your password in an  unsolicited phone call or email.&nbsp; Also, remember to log out of your  ChristianDatingForFree.com account and close your browser window when you have  finished your session.&nbsp; This will help to ensure that others cannot access  your Personal Information and correspondence if you share a computer with  someone else or are using a computer in a public place.&nbsp; </p>
