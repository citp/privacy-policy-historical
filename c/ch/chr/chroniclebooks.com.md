Chronicle Books recognizes that it is essential to protect the privacy of users on the Web. For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name, but not the email address. The information is used for internal review as a way to track our visitation and make improvements to the site, and then discarded. No other information is collected without the consent of the visitor. 

To enable users to purchase books via chroniclebooks.com, a user's personally identifying information will be shared with a third-party service provider solely for the purpose of order fulfillment. A user's personally identifying information will never be sold or rented to any other party. All credit card information is captured in a secure server. Once we have processed your order, we will safely discard your credit card information. We may hold on to your billing and shipping information for future mailings promoting books similar to the one you ordered, but we will not share or sell this information at any time. 

We collect the email addresses of the subscribers to our online newsletter, but this information is used solely for the purpose of the newsletters, and for no other mailings. To remove your email address from the newsletter subscriber list, go to: <http://www.chroniclebooks.com/Adult/Newsletter/subscribe.html> and follow the instructions to unsubscribe. 

Occasionally, we conduct contests or promotions through our Web site, and ask visitors to submit their name and address. This information is used only for the purpose of the contest or promotion and then discarded. 

KIDS: Make sure you have the permission of your parent or guardian before sending any information about yourself (name, address, email address, etc.) to us or anyone else over the Internet, and before making purchases online.
