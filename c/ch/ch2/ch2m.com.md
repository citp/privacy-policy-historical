To ensure compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, CH2M provides multiple recourse options for EU citizens as follows:  
 _Contact CH2M_  
Should you have a complaint, CH2M encourages you to contact us. Based upon the nature of the inquiry, CH2M’s Data Privacy Officer may also be engaged to review and assist as appropriate. CH2M will respond within 45 days of receipt of the complaint.

 _Independent Recourse Mechanism_  
If your complaint is not resolved after contacting CH2M, you may seek independent recourse to investigate and resolve the dispute by submitting the complaint to the appropriate Data Protection Authority (DPA) of the EU Member State where CH2M has operations and you reside. The list of DPAs and contact information may be found at:  
<http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm>

The scope of the arbitration will be limited to the issue of whether CH2M has violated its obligations under the Privacy Shield Principles in relation to your Personal Data, and whether any such violation remains fully or partially unremedied.
