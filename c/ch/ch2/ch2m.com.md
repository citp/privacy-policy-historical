CH2M may store, use, and disclose personal information as authorized or required by applicable law, including making disclosures that are necessary or advisable to: (1) protect the rights, health, safety, or property of CH2M or others; (2) allow for lawful security related or law enforcement investigations; and (3) comply with applicable laws, regulations, or other lawful requirements.
