# Site privacy policy - Forums Usage and Help - Chinese-forums.com

Due to stuff you can read about [here](http://news.google.com/news/story?q=google+interest+based+ads&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ncl=dC1WSFGagk9dsNMjK1ETEtoLumtYM&hl=en&ei=RhvBSci3FIG86gPGjbSwDQ&sa=X&oi=news_result&resnum=4&ct=more-results&cd=1), we need a privacy policy. As all I could come up with was 'Won't sell your email addresses, promise' I found one on the Internet. Sticking it up here for comments before making it official. 

For reference, the Adsense ads aren't shown to logged-in users currently.
