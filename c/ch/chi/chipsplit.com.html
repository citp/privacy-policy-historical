					<li><b>Means of Collecting &amp; Processing Data.</b><br>
We may automatically collect certain data as discussed above and receive Personal Information about you where you provide such information through the Service or other communications and interactions with ChipSplit.com.

From time-to-time, we may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and, therefore, you have the choice of whether or not to disclose such information.
