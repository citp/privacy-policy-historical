In addition to information that you choose to submit to us, we automatically receive and store certain information when you visit or interact with the Site (" **Usage Information** "). Usage Information is stored on and accessed from your personal computer, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a " **Device** ") whenever you visit or interact with our Site.

A few of the Tracking Technologies used on the Site, include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):

Cookies.
    A cookie is a file placed on a Device to uniquely identify your browser and to store information on your Device. Our Site may use HTTP cookies, HTML5 cookies, Flash cookies and other types of cookie technology to store information on local storage. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some (but not all) instances can be blocked by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options. Please note that these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, visit www.adobe.com. Please understand that if you disable or remove any type of cookie, some parts of our Site may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Site your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. 
Web Beacons.
    A Web Beacon is a small tag (which may be invisible to you) that may be placed on our Site's pages and messages. Web beacons may be used by us for a number of purposes, including to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many emails that were sent by us were actually opened or to count how many particular links were actually viewed. 
Embedded Scripts.
    An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on within our Site. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or one of our third party service providers, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. 
ETag, or entity tag.
    An Etag or entity tag is a feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash and/or HTML5 cookies.
Browser Fingerprinting.
    Collection and analysis of information from your Device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other similar data, for purposes of identification.
Recognition Technologies.
    Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user).

  * for the prevention of fraudulent activity and improved security functionality
  * to allow you to make use of shopping cart functionality;

## 5\. Ads and Information About You

Data about your activities online is being collected on our Site for use in providing advertising tailored to your individual interests. We may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements across the Internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party websites and viewing of ads and of our content. Third parties may offer you a choice as to whether or not to have your information collected for that purpose. This section of the Privacy Policy provides details and explains how to exercise that choice.

You may see certain ads on our Site as well as on other third-party websites across the Internet because we participate in advertising networks administered by third parties. These networks track your online activities over time and across third party websites and online services (e.g., apps) by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of the Tracking Technologies described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, and they use this information to show you advertisements (including our ads) that are tailored to your individual interests. The information they collect includes information about your visits to our Site, such as the pages you have viewed. These third-party tracking technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your device and may set or change settings on your device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may act as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.

This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our Site and on third-party websites that participate in the ad network, such as websites that feature advertisements delivered by the ad network. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. 

We may also use Tracking Technologies, such as our own cookies, to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests. To opt out of our cookies used for online advertising, click [here](http://dtmc.chicos.com/adinfo/choice/prod/?type=fpc&cid=3042&cname=Chicos&cmagic=3fd609&clogo=3041.png&loc=us&lang=en-us). We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as a DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Site.

## 6\. Third-Party Content and Links to Third-Party Sites

The Site may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your Device Identifier when pages from the Site are served to you. In addition, when you are on the Site, you may be directed to other services that are operated and controlled by third parties. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties. For example, if you "click" on a link, the "click" may take you off the Site onto a different site. These other sites may independently collect data about you and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. 

## 7\. Your California Privacy Rights 

We may from time to time elect to share certain information about you collected by us on the Site with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents who have supplied personal data, as defined in the statute, to us, under certain circumstances, to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of personal data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If this applies, you may obtain the categories of personal data shared and the names and addresses of all third parties that received personal data for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2017 will receive information about 2016 sharing activities). To make such a request, please provide sufficient information for us to determine if this applies to you, attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. To make such a request (limit one request per year), please submit a written request to the following address (limit one request per year): Chico's, 11215 Metro Parkway, Fort Myers, FL 33966 (Attn: General Counsel. – California Privacy Rights Notice). You must include your full name, email address, and postal address in your request. 

## 8\. California / Delaware Do Not Track Disclosures

Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services (e.g., browser do not track signals). Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.

## 9\. Transfer of Information to and from the United States

Our Site is operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that you will be sending your personal data to the United States.

To order products internationally (if you are located outside of the United States), your information will be collected directly or shared by us with our third-party service provider, Borderfree, Inc. Click [here](https://www.borderfree.com/#/privacy/en_us) to view Borderfree's Privacy Policy.

## 10\. Children's Privacy 

We understand the importance of protecting children's privacy in the interactive world. Our Site is not intended to be used by children and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. If you are a child under 13 years of age, you are not permitted to use the Site and should not send any information about yourself to us through the Site.

## 11\. Security

We ensure data is secure by providing, among other things, secured access to physical buildings and data processing areas, controlled computer access to data processing systems including individual log-ins, complex password requirements, automatic time out for inactivity, automatic lock for invalid password attempts, controlled, monitored and traceable staff access rights to personal data, encryption and firewall technologies, data back-up and storage, input and job control through record authentication, password requirements and electronic recording of entries and routine auditing, and separation of processing for different purposes. We incorporate commercially reasonable safeguards to help protect and secure your personal data, however, no data transmission over the Internet, mobile networks, wireless transmission or electronic storage of information can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our Site, and you provide us with your information at your own risk.

If you receive an email that appears to be a request from us for personal data, **Do Not Respond** as this may be a "phishing" scam designed to steal your information. Never include your credit or debit card number or other sensitive information in an email as it is not a secure means of transmitting information. We will only request such information during secure transactions on our Site. 

It is your responsibility to safeguard any password you create to access "My Account" and to sign-out when your visit is complete.

## 12\. Updating and Modifying Your Communications Preferences

You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration. If you wish to update, delete or modify your personal data or do not wish to be contacted via email, direct mail and/or telephone for commercial purposes, please make changes to “My Account” online by clicking “Profile & Preferences”. Be sure to “Save” once you’ve completed your changes. You may also call or email Customer Service. Provide your exact name and postal or email address or telephone number so that we may identify you accurately. You may also “unsubscribe” from our email by using the link provided at the bottom of each email. In most cases it takes ten (10) days or less to process your “do not email” request. It may take up to eight (8) weeks to process your “do not mail” request because mailings are planned long in advance. You may also opt out of our SMS Program by replying STOP to the last message received, or to 57705. You may receive a single subsequent SMS message confirming your opt-out. If you purchase online, we will continue to confirm your order and shipment status via email, postal address or telephone. If you change your mind about choices you’ve previously made, make changes to “My Account” online or contact Customer Service (Contact Us). We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable (but we may retain prior information as business records). Please note that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons.
