# Chipmark - Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. Chipmark agrees to notify you of: 

  * What personally identifiable information of yours is collected by Chipmark.
  * The organization collecting the information. 
  * How the information is used.
  * With whom the information may be shared.
  * The choices available regarding the collection, use and distribution of information.
  * The security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Chipmark's control.
  * How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.



The privacy practices of this statement apply to our services available under the domain and sub-domains of www.chipmark.com (the "Site"). By visiting this website, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use or access our Site. 

This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect from you as part of the normal operation of our services and what may happen to that information. Although this policy may seem long, we have prepared a detailed policy because we believe you should know as much as possible about Chipmark's practices so that you can make informed decisions. 

By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in registration, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your anonymous information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Chipmark will never release your personal information to anyone for any reason. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the Chipmark User Agreement. This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance in registration for new registering users, and is otherwise effective on October 31st, 2004 for all users. The previous amendment to this Privacy Policy was effective for all users on October 31st, 2004. 

Information collected online is usually defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable. 

Anonymous Information refers to data that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For example, Chipmark collects some information each time a visitor comes to Chipmark's site, so we can improve the overall quality of the visitor's online experience. Chipmark collects the visitor's IP address (i.e., whether the user is logged on from ibm.com or aol.com), referral data (i.e., the Internet address of the last Web page visited by a user before clicking over to the Chipmark site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). You do not have to register with Chipmark before we can collect this anonymous information. Chipmark's collection of bookmark information (e.g. url, name, description, hit count, etc.) is also considered anonymous information. 

Personally Identifiable Information refers to data that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and postal address, which may be collected in addition to the anonymous data described in the above paragraph. 

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. 

Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. 

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) 

If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Chipmark products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings. However, many Chipmark products and services do not require that you accept cookies. 

Chipmark uses its own cookies in order to:  
Maintain your login information if you select the auto-login feature.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with researchers. For example, we may tell a researcher that X number of individuals visited a certain website, or that Y number of users filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

You may not use the "Email This Item to a Friend" service or other email services that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our User Agreement. We do not permanently store email messages or the email addresses sent from these tools. 

If you send and email using the Email This Item to a Friend service to an email address that is not registered in our community, we do not use that email address for any purpose other than to send your email. We do not rent or sell these email addresses.
