# Privacy - ChinesePod

The ChinesePod privacy policy guarantees that all of your personal information is strictly private and safe from harm or abuse. All information you pass along to us while on the site is secure and strictly confidential.

Reading this privacy policy will help you make informed decisions when using our site, our products, and services.

### Why Do We Collect Information From You?

We collect information to enable us to provide a more customized service (for example, your personal information allows us to create your personalized home page, ChinesePod ID and RSS feed). We think this better level of service is good for the student. In addition, your contact information allows us to inform you of our latest product announcements, updates, offers, and events.

### What Information Do We Collect?

When you visit our web site, you may provide us with three types of information:

  1. **Explicit information**  
In order to create a free ChinesePod account, and customize your profile, you can choose to disclose personal information (such as email address, city of residence, hobbies, etc). You can access and edit this information whenever you like.
  2. **Implicit information**  
When you use the site, we collect usage data (how many times you login, which lessons you study, how long you spend on them, etc). (Implicit information is only analyzed in aggregate).
  3. **Exchange information**  
We also store information that you have exchanged with any of the ChinesePod staff (teachers, sales, and the support team).



These three types of information help us determine what new information is most useful to you, and which parts of our website and services are of most interest to you.

### Does ChinesePod Use Cookies?

Yes. Like most other websites, ChinesePod uses a standard technology called "cookies" to collect information on how the website is used, and to make usage more convenient for the user (cookies allow us to provide the personal homepage, for example).

### What Are Cookies?

A "cookie" is very small text document which, if your browser settings permit it, our website places on your computer. Cookies help us recognize you and tailor your experience. It is important to note that cookies do not allow us to gather any private information.

### What Other Techniques Does ChinesePod Use?

We also use our web server logs to see how our website is used. This information can include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our website, and the websites visited just before and just after our Web site. Our advertisers and ad serving companies may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to determine which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them.

### How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?

ChinesePod takes extensive measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required, and on all servers where this information is stored. Also, to make a purchase on ChinesePod, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Firefox, Safari, Netscape Navigator 3.0, or Internet Explorer. This measure protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.

### How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?

We use personal information only for the purposes of administering our business activities and providing customer service. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our website, as well as new services and special offers we think you will find valuable.

If you do not want us to keep you up to date with ChinesePod news, updates and the latest information on our product and services, click Your Account and update your personal contact information and preferences. Naturally, if you notify us that you do not want us to use your information for a particular purpose, we will not do so.

### Sharing Information with Third Parties

ChinesePod will never share your information with a third party.
