###  7\. Automated individual decision making including profiling 

Automated individual decision making, including profiling, takes place when you request a quote from Chill through our website. The insurance providers we provide quotes on behalf of carry out this automated individual decision making. This means that we run your personal data through algorithms and internal models set by each of the insurance providers to determine your risk profile and calculate your insurance premium. This process includes the use of information you provide to Chill in your online quote form. For example, some factors that insurance providers would use for a car insurance policy are the age of the vehicle, location where the vehicle is parked and the age of drivers. This may include special categories of data, where relevant, such as Health Data or Criminal Convictions and offences data such as penalty point data. 

You have the right to human intervention to express your interests and contest automated decisions. If for any reason you are not satisfied with the quote obtained via our website please contact our office to request a quote on [01 400 3400](tel:01 400 3400). For further information on individual insurance provider’s automated individual decision making processes, please refer to their privacy policies. 

###  8\. Retention 

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. This means that the period of time for which we store your personal data may depend on the type of data we hold. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

There are special requirements set out under Chapter V of the GDPR to regulate such data transfers and ensure that adequate security measures are in place to safeguard and maintain the integrity of your personal data on transfer. 

Where we transfer your personal data outside the EEA to our suppliers, we will make sure that it is protected to the same extent as in the EEA and we will use at least one of the following safeguards: 

  * Transfer it to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the EEA
  * Put in place a contract with the recipient that means they must protect it to the same standards as the EEA.
  * Transfer it to organisations that are compliant with the EU/US Privacy Shield. This is a framework that sets privacy standards for data sent between the US and EU countries. It makes sure those standards are similar to those used and expected within the EEA.

Chill Insurance will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy. We will use all reasonable efforts to put in place security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.

They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website; any transmission is at your own risk.
