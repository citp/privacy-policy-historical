# Chicago Tribune | Privacy Policy

  
|    
|  Privacy policy The Chicago Tribune is dedicated to providing visitors to chicagotribune.com and its other online services with a highly interactive and personalized experience, while at the same time protecting users from unexpected use of personally identifiable information. Like other Web publishers, we collect information from users in order to deliver more individualized content and advertising to them, but only within the limits specified in this policy.

**How we gather information from users**

chicagotribune.com requires users to register with us and provide certain information, including an e-mail address, in order to gain access to some content. Some of the demographic information we request will be voluntary and identified as "optional" during the registration process. You may change or update your registration with us at any time by [returning to this page](https://web.archive.org/ctcom/EditRegistration), or by pointing your Web browser at [http://www.chicagotribune.com/go/register](https://web.archive.org/ctcom/EditRegistration).

We also gather individually identifiable information that you provide to us on a voluntary basis in connection with activities other than accessing our sites. For example, information may be gathered from: sweepstakes and contest registration or submissions; voting and polling activities; message boards and chat rooms; registration for subscription services related to either the printed or electronic editions of the newspaper; or from other interactive areas of our sites. In connection with our current and planned electronic commerce services, you will be asked to provide information, including credit card information, that is necessary to complete a transaction you have requested.

chicagotribune.com also employs "cookie" technology to improve your navigation through the site and to allow customization of the site according to your individual preferences. Once you register with us, a string of information (the cookie) is passed to your web browser and stored on your computer. This cookie identifies you as a unique, registered user and holds your preferences as you have identified them during the registration and customization process. The cookie stores your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit and granting you the access privileges associated with your registration. 

Cookies may also be used to control the number of times you encounter particular advertisements while visiting our sites. You can set your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do we will not be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences and you will often be asked to re-enter your user name and password.

Like most web sites, chicagotribune.com also logs IP addresses, or the electronic location of your computer on the Internet.

**What we do with the information we collect**

The information you share with us may be used in several ways. Typically, during your visit to our sites, we will use your registration and demographic information to deliver targeted editorial or advertising content we think might interest you. 

We may also combine information about you, your computer, and your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to create profiles of chicagotribune.com users as a whole and to identify their preferences in content and advertising. This aggregated information occasionally may be shared with our advertisers and business partners as well as used by chicagotribune.com and its related companies.

We will use personal information to communicate with you about: your registration and customization preferences; our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/tools/help/copyright.htm) and privacy policies; other services and products offered by the Chicago Tribune and its related companies; and other important information. We may also communicate with you about changes and improvements to chicagotribune.com and to inform you of sweepstakes or promotions that we are conducting.

From time to time, we or our advertising and promotional partners may call to your attention products, special offers and unique content we believe might be of interest to you. However, if you prefer that we not use your registration information to allow you to receive such information from third parties, you may decline during the registration process or at any later time by pointing your Web browser at <http://www.chicagotribune.com/go/register>. If you do so, you will not receive communications from third parties utilizing information collected from our sites during the registration process.

Personal information collected by chicagotribune.com may also be used for site administration and troubleshooting and to process e-commerce transactions, contest entries and other matters you initiate.

**Affiliated and Linked Sites**

chicagotribune.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that our promotional partners, advertisers, sponsors, third-party Internet sites, and content providers accessible through our site may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. chicagotribune.com is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. Users should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing personally identifiable information through co-branded, affiliated or linked sites. 

While on our site, you may occasionally receive cookies from our advertisers or promotional partners. The placement of cookies by third-party servers is common on the Internet. chicagotribune.com does not control the use of these cookies or the resulting information; therefore, these cookies are not subject to chicagotribune.com's privacy policy.

Finally, you should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address, or other messages) on message boards or in chat areas of chicagotribune.com, that information can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of chicagotribune.com.

**Children**

chicagotribune.com does not knowingly collect or solicit personally-identifiable information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover that we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately.

The foregoing policy is effective as of October 5, 1999. chicagotribune.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
