# Chick-fil-A: Privacy

This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the information practices of Chick-fil-A, Inc. ("Chick-fil-A”) and, as applicable, its affiliates, subsidiaries and related entities such as CFA Properties, Inc. and CFA Servco, Inc. (“Affiliates”), (Chick-fil-A and its Affiliates are referred to herein, as the context may require, as “we”, “us”, or “our"). It covers the information that Chick-fil-A collects about you, how we use and share this information, and your choices regarding our collection and use. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us via the Contact Information provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.

### The Chick-fil-A Franchise System

The Chick-fil-A franchise system is a restaurant network made up of company-operated, franchised, and licensed Chick-fil-A restaurant businesses. Chick-fil-A franchisees (“Franchised Operators” or “Operators”) own and operate their own individual franchised businesses. Chick-fil-A licensees (“Licensees”) are granted a license to use Chick-fil-A’s trade name and marks in the sale of Chick-fil-A products at Chick-fil-A licensed locations. Franchised Operators and Licensees are independent third parties, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of any Franchised Operator or Licensee. Please see the Franchised Operator and Licensee Websites section for more information regarding a Franchised Operator’s or Licensee’s website.

If Chick-fil-A chooses to share any of your information, including Personal Information, with any of its Franchised Operators or Licensees, they will be required to adhere to this Privacy Policy.
