(Note:  In order to receive Chick-fil-A One Offers, you must download the app and redeem using the QR Code included in the app. See below for details)  You will be required to provide the requested information, including, but not limited to, user name, password, name, and e-mail address. Chick-fil-A may periodically request additional information to help us get to know you better. You agree to provide true and accurate information and to ensure that information provided by you is up-to-date and accurate. Communications with you will be made using contact information most recently provided by you. Chick-fil-A is not responsible for your inability to receive or redeem Offers or other loss arising from your failure to provide and maintain accurate contact information. 

Chick-fil-A and participating Chick-fil-A restaurants may send messages from time to time using the contact information provided by you. Such messages may include system updates, flash bulletins, Offer confirmations, administrative announcements, special requests and the like and may be sent via notifications in the App, via e-mail, regular mail, or communicated to you on a receipt or display at the time of use of an your One account. 

Your participation in any Offer is personal and non-transferable. Offer status and/or individual Offer may not be purchased, sold, bartered, brokered or otherwise transferred. There are no membership fees associated with Chick-fil-A One Offers.  Offers made via Chick-fil-A One are purely promotional offers.  You agree that no portion of your payment for purchases qualifying for any Offer constitutes consideration paid for any Offer.

**Offers**.  The CFA One Offers are issued on a periodic basis. They are referred to as ‘rewards’ in the App but may appear with different descriptions from time to time. Upon signing up, you will receive notice via the Chick-fil-A One account of your current Offer.  Once you activate a Chick-fil-A One account, you progress towards an Offer and are eligible to receive special offers, from time to time.  The number, type and frequency of Offers are based on a number of factors, each of which are subject to change, without notice.  Those factors may include, without limitation, volume and type of purchases at participating Chick-fil-A restaurants, number of visits and frequency of visits to participating Chick-fil-A restaurants, interaction with other Chick-fil-A applications or promotions; or special offers made directly by Chick-fil-A Operators or Chick-fil-A which may include ways to progress toward your next Offer via a special promotion.   For Offers that are based on purchases, the following types of purchases at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant qualify: (1) placing and completing a Mobile order for a qualifying purchase through the App; (2) using your Chick-fil-A One Digital Gift Card to complete a purchase or transaction at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant; (3) logging into your Chick-fil-A One account online and making an online purchase at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant; and (4) or completing a transaction at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant and scanning the digital code linking to your Chick-fil-A One account at checkout.

You must use the App or if placing an online order, be signed in to your Chick-fil-A One account, to complete the qualifying purchase or activity in order for that purchase or activity to count towards your progress to the next qualifying Offer.  Benefits applied from any single qualifying purchase or activity may only be credited to one (1) Chick-fil-A One account.  The qualifying purchase or activity will be applied to your One account after completion of the qualifying purchase or activity. In certain cases, it may take twenty-four (24) hours or more to be credited. Chick-fil-A shall not be responsible for, or liable to, you, or any person or entity, in any way for any losses, costs or expenses incurred by a delay, error or omission in crediting a qualifying purchase or activity to your Chick-fil-A One account.

Offers are purely promotional offers and may have certain restrictions including expiration dates and short, time-limited redemption periods.  For free drink or food Offers, some restrictions apply and items are subject to availability at participating Chick-fil-A restaurants.  All Offers must be redeemed prior to the stated expiration date for the Offer and in compliance with any other conditions associated with the particular Offer to be valid.  It is your responsibility to check your Chick-fil-A One account periodically for Offers and use the Offers prior to the stated expiration date.

Activities which allow progress towards Offers do not count towards and may not be combined with other programs.  Activities tied to specific Offers must be fully completed and will only result in one Offer, regardless of the number of times the activity is performed.  Chick-fil-A reserves the right to change, modify or update these Offers and the qualifying purchases and activities to progress to an Offer from time to time without notice. Certain purchases and transactions do not qualify, including, without limitation: (i) purchases of Chick-fil-A gift cards or gift certificates; (ii) purchases or transactions made using an Offer or other promotional item (such as a Be Our Guest card); or (iii) catering purchases made as a guest (e.g. made while not signed in to your Chick-fil-A One account), whether made in-store, online or through the App. Chick-fil-A is under no obligation to provide you with any particular number of Offer opportunities or special offers. Chick-fil-A reserves the right to limit enrollment at any time. 

**Special Offers** : Chick-fil-A and participating Chick-fil-A restaurants, in their sole and absolute discretion, may periodically offer the opportunity for additional Offers on particular transactions or special offers (“ **Special Offers** ”). Special Offers may also be distributed to you via the App or via e-mail or mail from time to time (based on the information you have in your One account). Special Offers may include periodic promotional offers on food, beverages and merchandise.  You must have your App set to receive notifications and/or have opted-in to receive email communications in order to receive promotional and marketing offers. Special Offers may be customized based on your qualifying purchases and preferences. In certain events, Special Offers may require that you have location settings enabled for them to be distributed to your App. Please note that Chick-fil-A and participating Chick-fil-A restaurants may be unable to send these Special Offers to you if you have turned off your notifications or location settings in the App; if you have elected not to receive email communications from Chick-fil-A; or if you have poor network connectivity.  Special Offers may have certain restrictions including expiration dates and short, time-limited redemption periods. Special Offers are personal to you and cannot be shared, copied or transferred. You may be required to present your Chick-fil-A One account information at the participating Chick-fil-A restaurant in order to redeem Special Offers. Read each offer carefully for specific details, conditions, limitations and restrictions.

**Redeeming Offers**.  To redeem an Offer, you must present the valid Offer in the App at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant (for in-person transactions) or be logged into your Chick-fil-A One account (for in App transactions). Offers are subject to availability and limitations as may be imposed by Chick-fil-A. Determinations regarding redemption of Offers are subject to the discretion of the participating Chick-fil-A restaurant.  Only one Offer may be redeemed per transaction. 

Once redeemed, the Offer will be indicated as redeemed in your Chick-fil-A One account. Updates to the status of Offers may take 24-48 hours or more to show up in your account. A list of current Offers and redeemed and expired Offers are available under your Chick-fil-A One account.  Offers have no cash value and are not redeemable for cash, gift certificates or gift cards.  Offers are promotional and do not constitute property of any Chick-fil-A One account holder.  Chick-fil-A reserves the right to limit the redemption of specific Offers and limit the number of Offers available. Chick-fil-A reserves the right to modify the number of qualifying purchases or transactions needed to receive specific Offers.

**Cancellation; Termination**.  You may opt-out of Chick-fil-A One Offers at any time, for any reason by cancelling your Chick-fil-A One account by calling Chick-fil-A CARES (1-866-232-2040).  If you cancel your One account, any unredeemed Offers and/or progress towards other Offers will automatically expire and will no longer be available for redemption. If you re-enroll at any time, you will start at the introductory Offers level as applicable.

Upon cancellation, your Chick-fil-A One account shall immediately cease and you may no longer receive Offers, redeem Offers previously received, receive Chick-fil-A One benefits, or make purchases using remaining balances on Digital Gift Card funds accessible via your Chick-fil-A One account. Chick-fil-A has no obligation to compensate you for any unredeemed Offers or benefits following cancellation, or for unused balances on Digital Gift Cards accessible via your Chick-fil-A One account. Chick-fil-A will not refund any unused balances on Digital Gift Card funds accessible through your Chick-fil-A One account (including via credit back to a credit card from which such funds may have been loaded to the Digital Gift Card), but will upon request at the time of cancellation of your Chick-fil-A One account transfer any unredeemed Digital Gift Card balances accessible through your Chick-fil-A One account to a physical Chick-fil-A gift card that you may use to make future purchases or gift to a donee of your choosing.  Because we plan our communications in advance, it may take several weeks for your request to become effective. If you continue to receive our communications after expressing an opt-out preference, please let us know so that we can investigate the situation.

Chick-fil-A reserves the right to suspend or terminate, at Chick-fil-A’s sole and absolute discretion, any Chick-fil-A One account if Chick-fil-A believes that the account holder has abused Chick-fil-A One Offers privileges, has violated or acted inconsistently with these Chick-fil-A One Offers Terms and Conditions or applicable law or acted in a manner harmful to our interests. Chick-fil-A further reserves the right to terminate a Chick-fil-A One account that has been inactive for a period of three (3) years or more.  You understand and agree that termination by Chick-fil-A of a Chick-fil-A One account will result in in the cancellation of all Offers associated with that account and the inability to earn and/or redeem further Offers, as well  as inability to access or use any remaining balances on Digital Gift Cards accessible via your Chick-fil-A One account.  Upon termination of your Chick-fil-A One account, Chick-fil-A will not refund any unused balances on Digital Gift Card funds accessible through your Chick-fil-A One account (including via credit back to a credit card from which such funds may have been loaded to the Digital Gift Card), but will upon request at the time of termination of your Chick-fil-A One account transfer any unredeemed Digital Gift Card balances accessible through your Chick-fil-A One account to a physical Chick-fil-A gift card that you may use to make future purchases or gift to a donee of your choosing.

Chick-fil-A reserves the right to terminate Chick-fil-A One Offers Program, or any or all benefits under Chick-fil-A One Offers, at any time, for any reason. In the event Chick-fil-A elects to terminate Chick-fil-A One Offers, Chick-fil-A will provide a notice of termination in accordance with these Terms, as they may be modified or amended from time to time. In the event of such termination, at Chick-fil-A’s election, Chick-fil-A may allow you to redeem any outstanding valid and unexpired Offers at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant until expiration of such Offers. ANY UNREDEEMED AND UNEXPIRED OFFERS SHALL BE CANCELLED AT THE LATER OF (1) THE EXPIRATION OF THE THEN-CURRENT OFFERS OR (2) NINETY (90) DAYS AFTER CHICK-FIL-A ONE OFFERS PROGRAM TERMINATION.  

**General Restrictions**.  Chick-fil-A shall be the sole arbiter in cases of suspected abuse, fraud, or violation of its One Offers Terms and Conditions and any decision it makes relating to termination or disabling of Chick-fil-A One your Chick-fil-A One account or of the overall Chick-fil-A Offers Program (including, but not limited to, cancellation of specific Offers) shall be final and binding.  Should you object to any of these One Offers Terms and Conditions, or any subsequent modifications thereto, or become dissatisfied with Chick-fil-A One Offers, your sole remedy is to discontinue participation in Chick-fil-A One Offers programs and properly cancel your account in the manner provided above.

### Chick-fil-A One ™ Terms & Conditions

**Chick-fil-A One™ Membership Terms**

**Last Updated:** July 25,2018

These terms and conditions govern the Chick-fil-A One™ Membership Program with respect to enrollments beginning August 1, 2018 or later (the “Program”).

The Chick-fil-A One™ Membership Program is operated by Chick-fil-A, Inc. (“Chick-fil-A”) and subject to the terms and conditions provided below and [www.chick-fil-a.com/legal](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/legal) (incorporated by this reference) (collectively, the “Terms”).

**Eligibility**. Participation in the Program is limited to persons residing in the United States who are eligible to use CFA Online Services. You must be at least 13 years of age to participate in the Program or to redeem Guest Offers (as defined below). Individuals under the age of majority in their jurisdiction must obtain permission from a parent or legal guardian to participate in the Program. Certain aspects of the Program are only available to those who are at least 18 years of age. Chick-fil-A One accounts are limited to one individual per account. No business entities, organizations, or groups may register for the Program.

**Program Description**. The Program is a customer loyalty program that allows Members (as defined below) to receive and redeem loyalty points (“Points”) for Rewards (as defined below) and Member Benefits (as defined below) on an individual basis for their own account. Members may receive Points and Member Benefits based on their Member Tier (as described below) through qualifying purchases, participating in activities or events, achieving certain Program milestones, or other actions or opportunities as may be presented by Chick-fil-A from time to time. These Terms provide a general overview of the Program. For more information on receiving, calculating, or redeeming Points, Rewards, Member Tiers and Member Benefits, features and experiences, please visit the [Chick-fil-A One™ Program page](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/one).

There is no fee associated with the Program. Participation in the Program is personal and non-transferable. Points, Member Tiers, Rewards and Member Benefits may not be gifted, purchased, sold, bartered, brokered or otherwise transferred, except that the Program may allow a Member to donate or gift Points and/or Rewards in certain limited instances. Points, Rewards, and Member Benefits available via the Program have no cash value, are not redeemable for cash, gift certificates or gift cards, are purely promotional and do not constitute property of any participant. No portion of any payment for purchases qualifying for the Program or any Points, Member Tier, Member Benefits, or Rewards constitute consideration paid for any of the foregoing. Chick-fil-A reserves the right to limit the redemption of specific Rewards and Member Benefits and limit the number of Points, Rewards, and Member Benefits available.

**Joining the Program**. To participate and enjoy the full benefits of the Program and be eligible for the benefits of a Member Tier, eligible individuals must enroll and become a member of the Program (“Member”). Chick-fil-A reserves the right to limit participation and enrollment at any time.

**How to Sign Up:** To become a Member, you must have a valid Chick-fil-A One account. Sign-up for a Chick-Fil-A One account by:

  * Downloading the Chick-fil-A App (“App”) to your Android™ or iPhone® device and follow the prompts to access account sign-up and/or sign-in page in the App.
  * Following the prompts at [www.chick-fil-a.com/One] to create an online account.
  * Joining through a special promotion or event offered by Chick-fil-A from time to time.



Certain select customers may be automatically enrolled as Members in the Program. If you are automatically enrolled, you will still be required to accept these Terms in order to complete your enrollment and participate in the Program, including to receive any Points or Member Benefits, and you will be prompted to accept these Terms upon initial log-in to your Chick-fil-A One account.

Upon sign-up, you will be required to provide the requested information, including, but not limited to, name, password, and e-mail address. Chick-fil-A may periodically request additional information to help us get to know you better. You agree to provide true and accurate information and to ensure that information provided by you is up-to-date and accurate. Communications with you will be made using contact information most recently provided by you. Chick-fil-A is not responsible for your inability to receive or redeem Points, Member Benefits, or Rewards or any other loss arising from your failure to provide and maintain accurate contact information.

Chick-fil-A and participating Chick-fil-A restaurants may send messages from time to time using the contact information provided by you. Such messages may include system updates, flash bulletins, Program confirmations, administrative announcements, special requests and the like and may be sent via notifications in the App, via e-mail, regular mail, or communicated to you on a receipt or display at the time of use of an your Chick-fil-A One account.

**Reward Points and Member Tiers.** The benefits available to Members through the Program are based on Member Tier level and the number of Points that you receive through participation in the Program. Chick-fil-A is under no obligation to provide Members with any particular number of Point-earning opportunities, special offers, or to send messages to them.

Points.

Purchase Activity. You will receive Points for qualifying purchases and transactions following enrollment as a Member in the Program based on your Member Tier level by completing one of the following purchases at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant: (1) placing and completing a Mobile order for a qualifying purchase through the App; (2) using your Digital Gift Card via in-app QR Code from the App; (3) logging into your Chick-fil-A One account online and making a qualifying purchase online; (4) scanning the digital code linking to your Chick-fil-A One account at checkout at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant; and (5) entering your Chick-fil-A One membership number and required information from your receipt from purchase at [www.chick-fil-a.com/MissedTransactions](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/MissedTransactions) within seven (7) days after the purchase date. Certain purchases and transactions do not qualify, including, without limitation: (i) purchases of Chick-fil-A gift cards or gift certificates; (ii) purchases or transactions made using Points, Rewards or other promotional item (such as a Be Our Guest card or Guest Offer (as defined below)); or (iii) catering purchases made as a guest (e.g. made while not signed in to your Chick-fil-A One account), whether made in-store, online or through the App. You will not receive Points for any amounts paid in sales, use or other transactional taxes.

Milestones, Events, Promotional Activities. From time to time, Chick-fil-A or others acting with our permission, may offer Members opportunities to earn Points, such as by inviting you to engage in certain promotional activities, upon achieving certain Program milestones, or other actions or opportunities as may be presented. Points for such activities or milestones will be awarded as described in the applicable offer and will be subject to any additional terms set forth with that offer.

Points are automatically tracked at the time of the qualifying purchase, transaction or activity. Points for any single qualifying purchase or activity may only be credited to one (1) Chick-fil-A One account. Points will be credited to the Chick-fil-A One account upon consummation of the qualifying transaction or activity garnering Points. In certain cases, it may take twenty-four (24) hours or more for Points to be credited. Chick-fil-A shall not be responsible for, or liable to, any Member, person or entity, in any way for any losses, costs or expenses incurred by a delay or error in crediting Points or Member Tier benefits to a Member's Chick-fil-A One account.

Available Points totals for a Member account will be displayed in your Chick-fil-A One account in the App or online at [www.chick-fil-a.com/MyProfile/Points](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/MyProfile/Points).

Member Tiers. Each Member will be assigned a member level status: Chick-fil-A One™, Chick-fil-A One™ Silver, or Chick-fil-A One™ Red (“Member Tier”) based on the number of Points that participant receives in his/her Chick-fil-A One member account annually, beginning on the date the Member joins the Program and ending on the annual anniversary of that date (“Rewards Year”) based on that member’s qualifying purchases and participation in other activities and opportunities during the Rewards Year. Details regarding the Member Tiers are provided on the Chick-fil-A OneTM Program page. Once a Member reaches a certain Member Tier status, the Member will retain that Member Tier status for the remainder of that year and the next Rewards Year. Member Tier status is determined annually and a Member must meet the requirements for a particular Member Tier status each Rewards Year or that status will not be maintained. Points from one Rewards Year do not roll over to a subsequent Rewards Year for purposes of determining Member Tier. Chick-fil-A reserves the right to change, modify or update the number of Points or other actions and requirements needed to earn Member Tier status and benefits.

**Redeeming Rewards.** To redeem Points for various available Chick-fil-A rewards (“Rewards”), you must access the Rewards section on the App or online at [www.chick-fil-a.com/MyProfile/AddRewards](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/MyProfile/AddRewards) to view Rewards available for redemption and select to redeem an available Reward. A list of Rewards that may be available for redemption as part of the Program are available at the [Chick-fil-A One™ Program page](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/one). You must have at least enough unredeemed and unexpired Points in your Chick-fil-A One account (“Available Points”) for the Reward you wish to redeem. Members must accrue a minimum of one hundred fifty (150) Available Points before the first redemption for any Reward. In any single transaction, only one Chick-fil-A One account may be used to redeem Points for Rewards. Points accrued by a Member in any purchase or transaction may only be redeemed for Rewards in a separate, subsequent purchase or transaction. Rewards provided to Members with Member Tier status have set terms and will expire in accordance with the terms stated for that Reward. Determinations regarding redemption of Points are subject to Chick-fil-A’s discretion.

Points will be subtracted from the Member's Chick-fil-A One account immediately when a Reward is requested based on the total Points for the requested Reward. Points will be restored to a Member's Chick-fil-A One account only in the event Chick-fil-A determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the Reward requested by that Member is unavailable or cannot be delivered. Chick-fil-A reserves the right to limit the redemption of specific Rewards and limit the number of Rewards available at any particular Member Tier status.

**Special Member Benefits.** Chick-fil-A and participating Chick-fil-A restaurants, in their sole and absolute discretion, may periodically offer the opportunity for additional Member Benefits on particular transactions or special offers (“Member Benefits”). Member Benefits may be distributed via the App, online or via e-mail or mail from time to time (based on the information you have in your Chick-fil-A One account). Member Benefits may include periodic promotional offers on food, beverages and merchandise, invitations to special events, or related benefits. You must have your App set to receive notifications and/or have opted-in to receive email communications in order to receive promotional and marketing offers in App or via e-mail. Member Benefits may be customized based on your qualifying purchases and preferences. In certain events, Member Benefits may require that you have location settings enabled for them to be distributed to your App. Please note that Chick-fil-A and participating Chick-fil-A restaurants may be unable to send these Member Benefits to you if you have turned off your notifications or location settings in the App; if you have elected not to receive email communications from Chick-fil-A; or if you have poor network connectivity. Member Benefits may have certain restrictions including expiration dates and short, time-limited redemption periods. Member Benefits are personal to you and cannot be shared, copied or transferred. You may be required to present your Chick-fil-A One account information at the participating Chick-fil-A restaurant in order to redeem Member Benefits. Read each offer carefully for specific details, limitations and restrictions.

**Guest Offers.** Individuals that have a Chick-fil-A One account, but do not enroll in the Program as a Member may receive offers on a periodic basis. They are referred to as ‘treats’ and ‘rewards’ but may appear with different descriptions from time to time (“Guest Offers”). In order to receive Guest Offers, eligible individuals must access their valid Chick-fil-A One account via [www.chick-fil-a.com/one] or via the App to obtain the QR Code for the Guest Offer. The number, type and frequency of Guest Offers are based on a number of factors, each of which is subject to change, without notice. Guest Offers are purely promotional offers, have no cash value and do not constitute property of the recipient. Guest Offers may have certain restrictions including expiration dates and short, time-limited redemption periods. Restrictions apply and items are subject to availability at participating Chick-fil-A restaurants. All Guest Offers must be redeemed prior to the stated expiration date to be valid. It is your responsibility to check your Chick-fil-A One account periodically for Guest Offers and use the Offers prior to the stated expiration date. To redeem a Guest Offer, you must present the valid Guest Offer at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant (for in-person transactions) or be logged into your Chick-fil-A One account (for in App transactions). Determinations regarding redemption of Guest Offers are subject to the discretion of the participating Chick-fil-A restaurant. Updates to the status of Guest Offers may take 24-48 hours or more to show up in your Chick-fil-A One account. A list of current Guest Offers and redeemed and expired Guest Offers are available under your Chick-fil-A One account.

**Expiration of Points and Rewards; Inactive Accounts.** Unredeemed Points expire upon the termination of your Chick-fil-A One account as described below. When you redeem your Points for Rewards, your oldest Available Points are used first. If you have any questions as to when your Points will expire, please contact Chick-fil-A by calling Chick-fil-A CARES (1-866-232-2040). Rewards and Member Benefits expire in connection with the terms provided with that Reward or Member Benefit. Once Points expire or are used to redeem a Reward, the Points will be removed from a Member’s account. Points will not be added back to a Member’s account if the Member does not use a Reward before it expires.

CFA reserves the right to cancel a Member’s Program registration and Chick-fil-A One account if the Member’s account remains inactive for a period of two (2) years or more. Accordingly, once you register for the Program, if you do not make a purchase or engage in an activity for which you will receive Points within your Member account within two (2) years after your initial registration or the last recorded purchase or activity for which you received Points, Chick-fil-A reserves the right to cancel your account. You understand and agree that cancellation by Chick-fil-A of a Chick-fil-A One account or Program membership will result in the cancellation of all Points, Rewards, Member Benefits, and any progress towards a Member Tier associated with that account and the inability to earn and/or redeem further Points, Rewards, and Member Benefits, regardless of Member Tier.

**Cancellation; Termination.** You may opt-out of the Program at any time, for any reason by cancelling your Chick-fil-A One account by calling Chick-fil-A CARES (1-866-232-2040). If you cancel your Chick-fil-A One account, any unredeemed Points, Rewards and Member Benefits, and/or progress towards a Member Tier will automatically be cancelled and will no longer be available for redemption. If you re-enroll at any time, you will start at the introductory Member Tier level as applicable. Chick-fil-A reserves the right to suspend or terminate, at Chick-fil-A’s sole and absolute discretion, any Chick-fil-A One account if Chick-fil-A believes that the account holder has abused Chick-fil-A One privileges, has violated or acted inconsistently with these Terms or applicable law or acted in a manner harmful to our interests.

Upon cancellation or termination for any reason, your Chick-fil-A One account shall immediately cease and you may no longer receive Points, Rewards, or Member Benefits. Chick-fil-A has no obligation to refund you for any unredeemed Points, Rewards, Member Benefits, or other benefits of the Program following cancellation. Because we plan our communications in advance, it may take several weeks for your request to become effective. If you continue to receive our communications after expressing an opt-out preference, please let us know so that we can investigate the situation.

Chick-fil-A reserves the right to change, modify or terminate the Program, or any or all benefits under the Program or any policy pertaining to the Program, at any time, for any reason, including our right to discontinue or change the Member Tiers or change the expiration date or redemption value of Points or Rewards, merge the Program with another program or to adjust how Points or Rewards are received, calculated or redeemed.

If Chick-fil-A elects to terminate or modify in a material way the Program or any benefits or policies, Chick-fil-A will provide a notice of the material modification or termination by posting the modifications or notice of termination on the [Chick-fil-A One™ Program page](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/one) and update the Last Updated date. We may also attempt to notify you in other ways. Any modifications will become effective immediately after such posting or other such notification. We encourage you to review these Terms regularly for modifications. In the event of such termination, at Chick-fil-A’s election, Chick-fil-A may allow you to redeem any outstanding valid and unexpired Points and Rewards at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant until expiration of such Points or Rewards. ANY UNREDEEMED AND UNEXPIRED POINTS OR REWARDS SHALL BE CANCELLED AT THE LATER OF (1) THE EXPIRATION OF THE THEN-CURRENT REWARDS OR (2) NINETY (90) DAYS AFTER PROGRAM TERMINATION.

**General Restrictions.** Chick-fil-A shall be the sole arbiter in cases of suspected abuse, fraud, or violation of its Terms and any decision it makes relating to termination or disabling of Program (including, but not limited to, cancellation of Points, Rewards, Member Perks and Guest Offers) shall be final and binding. Should you object to any of these Terms, or any subsequent modifications thereto, or become dissatisfied with the Program, your sole remedy is to discontinue participation in Program and properly cancel your account in the manner provided above.

Please note this Privacy Policy does not apply to any affiliate, subsidiary or related entity of Chick-fil-A, Inc. that maintains its own privacy policy.

We collect information when you share stories, content, suggestions, or other input, or submit requests for information from us.

You are responsible for all actions resulting from any information you post on our Online Services or social media pages. Please remember that any information you post on social media pages may become publicly available, is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and Chick-fil-A is not responsible for the results of such postings.

### **2\. Information We Collect Automatically or from Others**

We obtain some information automatically, for example, when you:

**(a) Access or use the Online Services**

**Traffic Data.** Our Online Services automatically track and collect your IP address, domain server, type of computer or device, and type of web browser. This helps us customize your online experience and assists with our marketing. We use this information to make our online experience better and more relevant for you. For example, we can show you menu items for the correct time of day in your location. 

**Cookies.** We also use cookies, which are small text files that are stored on your computer and allow websites to remember information about you (“Cookies”). You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to not accept certain cookies. However, if you decide not to accept Cookies from our Online Services, you may not be able to take advantage of all available features. Please see our **[Cookie and Interest-based Advertising Policy](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/legal#chick-fil-a_cookie_and_interest-based_avertising_policy)** to learn about the types of Cookies we use, how we use them, and your choices for Cookies. 

**Web Beacons.** Certain pages on the Online Services and social media pages may contain web beacons (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, and clear GIFs), which are small bits of code embedded in pages or images on the Online Services and social media pages (“Web Beacons”). The Web Beacons may be used with Cookies to understand how you interact with us, so we can manage and improve those interactions. We may also include Web Beacons in e-mails we send to you to learn if messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded. This helps us improve future messages and makes them more meaningful to you. 

**Other Technologies.** We also utilize other tracking technologies. For example, if permitted by applicable law, we may collect “referrers”. A “referrer” is information your web browser passes along to web servers that refers to the URL from which you accessed the Online Services. Like most websites, we may also collect environmental variables, which include, among other things, the domain from which you access the Internet, the time you accessed the Online Services or social media pages, the type of web browsers and operating system or platform used, the Internet address of the website you left to visit the Online Services or social media pages, the names of the web pages you visit, and the Internet address of the website you visit next. We use these technologies for marketing purposes and to improve your experience with our Online Services.

Information collected automatically may be combined with other personal information we have about you so that we can improve and customize the Online Services and our communications and promotions. When we know how you interact with our Online Services, we can serve you better.

In a nutshell, the following are examples of information we collect with these automated technologies:

  * your IP address, browser type, and operating system;
  * the mobile device you use and its temporary or persistent unique device identifiers (sometimes called “UDID”);
  * pages you view within the Online Services;
  * websites you visited before coming to the Online Services;
  * video viewing history for videos you watch on the Online Services; 
  * emails from us that you open and/or forward; and/or
  * offers or links from us to which you connect.



We also use third-party data analytics tools and services. For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), for certain Online Services. Google Analytics collects information such as how often you access the Online Services, what pages you access, and what other sites or services you used previously. We use the information provided by Google Analytics to improve our Online Services and serve you better.

For more information regarding how Google collects, uses and shares your information, please visit: <https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites>. Google tells us that Google provides you more choices on how your information is collected by Google Analytics by offering you an Opt-out Browser Add-on which can be located at: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>. According to Google, this Add-On prevents Google Analytics from sharing information about visit activity.

**(b) Use location-enabled devices like a mobile phone to access the location-based Services**

If you utilize any of the location-based services such as “Find a Restaurant” on our Online Services or from location-enabled devices like your mobile phone, with your consent where required, we may collect, use, and share location data, including the real-time geographic location of your device. We use the location data to provide Services such as mobile order fulfillment, and to improve location-based Services. We may share your location data with third-party service providers who help us provide the Services such as identifying nearby restaurants, surfacing available market offers, and estimating mobile order pickup or delivery timing. You may limit access to your location data by adjusting the permissions in your device.

We will use the contact information you provide to communicate with your friend or family member on your behalf. 

**(f) Franchised Operators and Licensees.** We process information about you from our Franchised Operators and Licensees when we provide certain services for them. We may access and process personal information to provide these services, for example, to process your payment and manage mobile orders and other services like third party delivery service order fulfilment on behalf of Franchised Operators and Licensees or at your direction. For more information, please see the **“Franchised Operator and Licensee Online Services”** Section.

## Supply Chain

### California Supply Chains Act

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 Disclosure

Chick-fil-A, Inc. (“CFA”) is committed to legal compliance and ethical conduct for itself and expects the same of its vendors. Thus, CFA’s policy is to only do business with vendors who have certified to CFA that their business practices are lawful, ethical and in compliance with the principles set forth in CFA’s Vendor Code of Conduct, and CFA expects its vendors to take steps to ensure the same of their own supply chains. Specifically, CFA will not conduct business with vendors employing persons under the age of 14, or in/under prison, indentured or bonded labor, or slave labor; benefitting from human trafficking; using corporal punishment or other forms of mental and physical coercion as a form of discipline; or providing or supplying goods or services tainted by any of the foregoing practices.

In accordance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, CFA makes the following disclosures:

CFA requires its vendors to certify that their business practices are lawful, ethical and in compliance with the principles set forth in CFA’s Vendor Code of Conduct (including those provisions relating to human trafficking and slavery), and that they take steps to ensure the same of their own supply chains. To ensure accountability, CFA reserves the right to terminate its business relationship with any vendor who fails to provide such certifications or whose business practices, or the business practices of its own suppliers and subcontractors, are not lawful, ethical and in compliance with the principles set forth in CFA’s Vendor Code of Conduct. CFA also reserves the right to terminate its business relationship with vendors who fail to provide written confirmation to CFA that they have a program in place to monitor their suppliers and subcontractors for compliance with law, good ethics, and the principles set forth in CFA’s Vendor Code of Conduct. CFA reserves the right to conduct verification and audits (including third-party verification and audits) of its suppliers regarding human trafficking and slavery. CFA has conducted general audits of certain of its suppliers, and has not observed violations with respect to human trafficking or slavery issues. CFA is currently considering whether and how to best use third-party supply chain verification and independent unannounced audits with its suppliers. CFA provides company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management with training on CFA’s business practices, vendor requirements, and CFA’s Vendor Code of Conduct, including those provisions relating to mitigating risks of human trafficking and slavery. Employees and management failing to meet CFA standards regarding slavery and trafficking are subject to disciplinary action.

EACH POTENTIAL PARTICIPATING PARTY (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY SPONSOR. A PARTICIPATING PARTY IS NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE UNLESS AND UNTIL THAT PARTICIPATING PARTY’S ELIGIBILITY HAS BEEN VERIFIED AND THE PARTICIPATING PARTY IS NOTIFIED THAT VERIFICATION IS COMPLETE. 

By participating in the Promotion, each Participating Party (or the parent or legal guardian of a Participating Party who is a minor Guest), fully and unconditionally accepts these Official Rules and the decisions of Sponsor (and Sponsor’s personnel and representatives), which are final and binding in all matters relating to the Promotion, and waives any right to claim ambiguity in these Official Rules.

**How to Participate** **:   **

Promotion consists of two phases:  a Selection Period and the Campout.

**PHASE ONE – SELECTION PERIOD RULES** **:**

Check the Promotion Website to confirm the entry period for the Participating Restaurant for the Promotion, as times may vary. Unless otherwise stated, the selection period starts at approximately 6:00 p.m. local time the day before the Participating Restaurant opens to the public (“ **Selection Period Start Time** ”). Arrive at the designated entry site identified on the Promotion Website for the Participating Restaurant prior to the Selection Period Start Time, notify a Sponsor representative of your desire to participate, and comply with all instructions provided by Sponsor’s representatives. **DO NOT ARRIVE MORE THAN THIRTY (30) MINUTES BEFORE THE SELECTION PERIOD START TIME AS YOU MAY BE DISQUALIFIED OR ASKED TO LEAVE AND RETURN.** Arriving at the designated entry site more than thirty (30) minutes before the Selection Period Start Time does not improve you chance of being selected to participate. Sponsor representative will check your ID and documents to confirm eligibility. **Do not remove items for the Campout from your vehicle until directed to do so.**

**Selection Process** **:**

**If more than 100 eligible individuals are present at the Selection Period Start Time and prepared to participate** , each eligible individual will be given one (1) ticket with a unique code (“ **Ticket** ”) and entered in a random drawing, which will take place shortly after the Tickets are distributed (“ **Drawing** ”). Individuals who arrive after the Selection Period Start Time may not be eligible to participate in the Drawing. **No unofficial sign-up sheets or lists will be honored.** Sponsor representative will randomly draw one hundred (100) Tickets. Each eligible individual holding a Ticket that has the same code as one of the 100 Tickets drawn by a Sponsor representative will be required to execute the Promotion release and waiver (“ **Release and Waiver** ”) prior to being assigned a Promotion number and identified as a “ **Participant** ”.

If there are any eligible individuals still present and prepared to participate after Promotion numbers are assigned to 100 Participants, Sponsor representative will randomly draw up to ten (10) additional Tickets to select individuals as Alternates. Each eligible individual holding a Ticket that has the same code as one of the additional tickets drawn will be required to execute the Release and Waiver prior to being assigned an Alternate Promotion number and identified as an “ **Alternate** ”. Each Alternate will be numbered 1-10 (or 101-110) based on the order that his or her Ticket was drawn. ****

A Ticket holder selected in the Drawing must be physically present at the time of the Drawing and must make his or her presence known to the announcer. No proxies or stand-ins are permitted. If a Ticket holder whose Ticket is drawn is not present or fails to make his or her presence known to the announcer, he or she may be disqualified, and an alternate Ticket may be selected. **Limit one (1) Ticket per eligible individual. Submission of multiple Tickets by or on behalf of the same individual will result in ineligibility with respect to all Tickets submitted by or for that individual. Odds of being selected as a Participant or Alternate depend on the number of eligible individuals receiving a Ticket for entry into the Drawing.   **

**If there are 100 or fewer eligible individuals present at the Selection Period Start Time** who are prepared to participate in the Promotion, Sponsor representative will select individuals and verify eligibility on a first-come, first-served basis up until 100 Participants and ten (10) Alternates are selected or until approximately one (1) hour before the Campout concludes, whichever occurs first. Each eligible individual will be required to execute the Release and Waiver prior to being identified as a Participant or Alternate and assigned a Promotion number. 

Tickets and/or Promotion numbers may not be sold, traded, transferred, assigned, donated or auctioned. Sponsor reserves the right to verify the eligibility of all Participants and Alternates. Participants and Alternates must provide all required information and consents on the Release and Waiver, including, without limitation, first and last name, to be eligible to participate in the Promotion. Only individuals meeting all eligibility requirements set forth in these Official Rules may participate.

**Subject to complying with these Official Rules, including, but not limited to, remaining in the Campout Area during the entire Campout, each Participant and Alternate will receive the designated Giveaway Item (as defined below).**

**PHASE TWO – CAMPOUT RULES** **:**

The Campout begins for each Participant and Alternate as soon as that individual: (a) has been selected as a Participant or Alternate and (b) has completed the registration process (which includes but is not limited to executing the Release and Waiver and being assigned a Promotion number). Unless otherwise stated on the Promotion Website for a Participating Restaurant, the Campout concludes at the time determined by Sponsor or its representative, at or prior to opening of the Participating Restaurant after all Giveaway Items have been distributed (e.g., typically at or before 6:00 a.m. local time the day after the Selection Period began). **Participants and Alternates understand and agree that the time and date for conclusion of the Campout may change, and Sponsor (or its representative) reserves the right to modify the duration of the Campout, in its sole discretion.** All costs and expenses associated with participation in the Campout not identified in these Official Rules are the responsibility of the Participating Party. 

**Participant and Alternate Participation:  **Participants (up to 100) and Alternates (up to ten (10)) must remain on the designated areas of the parking lot, landscape area or other location of the Participating Restaurant as designated by Sponsor and Sponsor’s representatives (the “ **Campout Area** ”) during the entire Campout in order to be eligible to receive the Giveaway Item at the conclusion of the Campout. Exceptions are made for bathroom breaks and/or to comply with any applicable legal requirement, or otherwise in the sole discretion of Sponsor. Each Participant and Alternate will be given identifying materials with his or her Promotion number written on it (e.g., Promotion wristbands and/or buttons). Identifying materials must be worn at all times during the Campout. If a Participant or Alternate leaves the Campout Area during the Campout and/or fails to comply with these Official Rules, he or she will be disqualified, at the sole discretion of Sponsor. In the event that a Participant is disqualified for any reason, that Participant will be asked to leave the Campout and an Alternate will take the former Participant’s place in the Campout and become a Participant, starting with Alternate number one (1) and continuing as needed to Alternate number ten (10). In the event that an Alternate is disqualified for any reason, the next Alternate in line will take the former Alternate’s place. 

**Guest Participation:**  Unless otherwise stated on the Promotion Website for a Participating Restaurant, each Participant and Alternate may be accompanied by up to five (5) guests (each, a “ **Guest** ”). Guests must be present at the time of their associated Participant’s or Alternate’s registration and cannot arrive later. Prior to being permitted to participate in the Campout as a Guest, the person must sign the Promotion release and waiver provided by Sponsor. Guests must comply with Sponsor’s instructions during the Campout and not create a decorum or safety issue, as determined by Sponsor, in Sponsor’s sole discretion. A minor may participate as a Guest provided:  (a) the minor is at least five (5) years of age or older as of the start of the Selection Period, (b) is accompanied by a parent or legal guardian at all times (who must be a Participant, Alternate, or Guest), and (c) the minor’s parent or legal guardian signs the Promotion release and waiver on the minor’s behalf. Guests will receive identifying materials (e.g., Promotion wristbands or buttons) bearing the Promotion number of their associated Participant or Alternate, and Guests must wear such identifying material(s) at all times during the Campout. Any Guest who leaves the Campout Area (other than for the permitted exceptions in these Official Rules) will not be permitted to return to the Campout. Once a person has been issued identifying material(s) bearing the Promotion number of their associated Participant or Alternate, the identifying material(s) cannot be shared with, or assigned to, any other person. A Participant or Alternate cannot substitute another person once a Guest has been verified and issued identifying material(s). 

**Additional Rules:**  Pets and animals (except service animals) are not permitted at the Participating Restaurant during the Promotion. No illegal drugs or alcohol are permitted at the Participating Restaurant at any time.

EACH POTENTIAL PARTICIPATING PARTY (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY SPONSOR. A PARTICIPATING PARTY IS NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE UNLESS AND UNTIL THAT PARTICIPATING PARTY’S ELIGIBILITY HAS BEEN VERIFIED AND THE PARTICIPATING PARTY IS NOTIFIED THAT VERIFICATION IS COMPLETE. 

By participating in the Promotion, each Participating Party (or the parent or legal guardian of a Participating Party who is a minor Guest), fully and unconditionally accepts these Official Rules and the decisions of Sponsor (and Sponsor’s personnel and representatives), which are final and binding in all matters relating to the Promotion, and waives any right to claim ambiguity in these Official Rules.

**How to Participate** **:**

Check the Promotion Website to confirm the time, date and location for entry and the time and date for the Red Carpet Rollout event for the Participating Restaurant, as times may vary by location. **Please note that the time, date and location for entry for Participant Selection (as described below) may be different from the time, date and location for the Red Carpet Rollout event.**

Arrive at the designated site for Participant Selection on the date and time identified on the Promotion Website for the Participating Restaurant (“ **Entry Start Time** ”), notify a Sponsor representative of your desire to participate, and comply with all instructions provided by Sponsor’s representatives. **DO NOT ARRIVE MORE THAN THIRTY (30) MINUTES BEFORE THE ENTRY START TIME AS YOU MAY BE DISQUALIFIED OR ASKED TO LEAVE AND RETURN.** Arriving at the designated entry site more than thirty (30) minutes before the Entry Start Time does not improve your chance of being selected to participate. Sponsor representative will check your ID and documents to confirm eligibility. 

**Participant Selection** **:**

**If more than 100 eligible individuals are present at the Entry Start Time** **and prepared to participate** , each eligible individual will be given one (1) ticket with a unique number or code (“ **Ticket** ”) and entered in a random drawing, which will take place shortly after the Tickets are distributed (“ **Drawing** ”). Individuals who arrive after the Entry Start Time may not be eligible to participate in the Drawing. **No unofficial sign-up sheets or lists will be honored**. Sponsor representative will randomly draw one hundred (100) Tickets. A Ticket holder selected in the Drawing must be physically present at the time of the Drawing and must make his or her presence known to the announcer. No proxies or stand-ins are permitted. If a Ticket holder whose Ticket is drawn is not present or fails to make his or her presence known to the announcer, he or she may be disqualified, and an alternate Ticket may be selected. **Limit one (1) Ticket per eligible individual. Submission of multiple Tickets by or on behalf of the same individual will result in ineligibility with respect to all Tickets submitted by or for that individual.** Each eligible individual holding a Ticket that has the same code as one of the Tickets drawn by a Sponsor representative will be required to execute the Promotion release and waiver (“ **Release and Waiver** ”) prior to being identified as a Participant and receiving a Promotion number. 

Tickets and/or Promotion numbers may not be sold, traded, transferred, assigned, donated or auctioned. Sponsor reserves the right to verify the eligibility of all Participants.

**If there are 100 or fewer eligible individuals present at the Entry Start Time** **who are prepared to participate in the Promotion** , Sponsor representative will select individuals and verify eligibility on a first-come, first-served basis up until 100 Participants are selected or until the end of the Entry Period (as defined below). If Participant Selection occurs on the date and at the location of the Red Carpet Rollout event, the time period for entry **(“Entry Period** ”) starts at the Entry Start Time and continues up until 100 Participants are selected or until thirty (30) minutes after the Event Start Time (as defined below), whichever occurs first. If Participant Selection occurs on a date or at a time or location separate from the Red Carpet Rollout event, the Entry Period starts at the Entry Start Time and continues for up to one (1) hour after the Event Start Time (time period may be extended at the sole discretion of the Sponsor or its representative); and if 100 Participants are not selected as of thirty (30) minutes prior to the Event Start Time, Sponsor may re-open the Entry Period to select additional Participants from eligible individuals who arrive and express their interest in participating for a period of thirty (30) minutes prior to the Event Start Time up until thirty (30) minutes after the Event Start Time or 100 Participants are selected, whichever occurs first. No additional Participants will be permitted to enter the Promotion after the conclusion of the Entry Period. Each eligible individual will be required to execute the Release and Waiver prior to being identified as a Participant and receiving a Promotion number. 

Each selected individual who executes the Release and Waiver and is provided a Promotion number as provided above will be considered a “ **Participant**.” Participants must provide all required information and consents on the Release and Waiver, including, without limitation, first and last name, to be eligible to participate in the Promotion.
