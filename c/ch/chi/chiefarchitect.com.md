## The Types of Information We Gather and How We Use It

Some basic information is automatically collected when you access our websites.

This type of information is also recorded in our server access logs, which are used to maintain the quality of our systems and the security of the data we collect. Automatically collected information will be discarded when we determine it is no longer necessary for the stated purposes.

We also collect identifiable information that you voluntarily provide directly to us, e.g. when making a purchase, requesting a trial version, or submitting data to us for other requests. In some places you may be asked to provide information about yourself. We use this information to fulfill your requests for products and services, to respond to your inquiries or comments, and to offer you other related products, programs, or services that may be of interest to you. We guard this private information, protect it from unauthorized access, and do not share it with third parties. It is stored and processed on information systems in the United States.

We reserve the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to fulfill legal obligations, to operate our systems properly, and to protect ourselves or our users. To further respect your privacy, we may at times request your consent prior to processing your data for some specific purpose, the details of which will be explained at the time of the request.

## Management of Personal Information

We respect your personal information and invite you to help us maintain it in line with your wishes. Our websites include tools to maintain some of the information you provide, and you may contact us to request access to, changes to, and in some cases erasure of certain information insofar as we are able to authenticate your identity in relation to the data.
