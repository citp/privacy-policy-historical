# Online Privacy Statement | Child Mind Institute

Effective May 24, 2018

We at Child Mind Institute, Inc. and Child Mind Medical Practice, PLLC (together, “CMI”) want the CMI website to be a safe and private place for users. We will do our part by not requiring you to register or provide any information at all to use most sections and features of the CMI website. In turn, you can do your part by reading this Online Privacy Statement and taking the steps outlined below.

  1. Acceptance



During your use of the CMI website (which includes childmind.org and related CMI sites, such as projecturok.org and healthybrainnetwork.org) you may be prompted to provide personal information. This is information you provide which personally identifies you, including, but not limited to, your name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number. Any time you provide personal information to us, this Statement will govern our use of the information you have provided. This Statement does not apply to information collected by third parties or offline.

By submitting personal information to us, you agree that we may use the information in accordance with this Statement. We will update this Statement as we deem necessary, and we will post any changes here so that you are continually aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. You should be sure to reread this Statement in its entirety from time to time. Your continued use of the CMI website will constitute your acceptance of such changes.

  2. Information Collection and Use



There are certain actions and areas of the CMI website that will require you to provide personal information. These include, but are not limited to:

  * signing up for email or newsletters
  * downloading certain reports or other documents
  * making a donation
  * requesting an appointment
  * submitting user content



If you do submit information to us, we will use that information for the purposes for which it was submitted. We may also use your information to personalize communications to you and keep you informed about other CMI-related activities, or as otherwise disclosed to you at the point of collection.

We automatically collect and store some information about your computer and your visit and store it in log files. This information includes information such as your computer’s IP address and the domain from which you access the Internet. We use this information to formulate statistics that show the number of visitors to the different sections of the CMI website and to help us make this website more useful to visitors. These statistics do not reveal personal information.

  3. Information Sharing



We use third-party vendors to provide services on the CMI website and in our offline business operations. The information that you submit on this website may be provided to those vendors on a confidential basis so that those vendors can provide services on our behalf. These services include, but are not limited to, donor contact management, credit card processing, email delivery, web analytics, and job application processing. A third-party vendor’s collection and use of personal information is governed by the policies of that vendor.

  4. Charitable Contributions



We do not sell, rent, or trade our donor’s names or personal information to or with any other entity, nor do we send mailings to our donors on behalf of other organizations. If you choose to make an online donation, you will have to provide your credit card billing information to a third-party payment processor. The third-party payment processor will process your credit card transaction and send CMI a transaction report that contains some of the personal information it collects (e.g. name and contact information) but not your credit card information.

  5. Email a Friend



If you use the Email a Friend service to tell a friend about the CMI website or newsletter, we will ask you for your email address and your friend’s email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit this website using your email address as the “from” email address. CMI does not use your email address or your friend’s email address for any other purpose. We will use the information you provide only to send the email you request.

  6. Special Information for Children Under 13 and Their Parents



CMI is committed to providing a safe and secure online experience for children who visit the CMI website and their families. Consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, CMI does not knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If you are under 13 and would like to access any areas of the CMI website that require your information, please have your parent or guardian send an email to the address below with a verifiable identity, giving us permission to allow you to utilize these areas. To respect the privacy of parents, information collected and used for the sole purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing notice is not maintained in retrievable form by CMI if parental consent is not obtained after a reasonable time.

If we have not received parental consent for a user who states or is found to be under 13, we cannot, by law, provide information to or respond to questions from that user. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information. Parents can request to review personal information collected from children, ask that information about their children be deleted, or revoke their consent by contacting us via email. To do this, we must verify the identity of the requesting parent. When a parent revokes consent, we will stop collecting and using information from that child.

  7. Visitors Outside the United States



If you are located outside the United States, you should be aware that the laws of the United States may be deemed to have inadequate data protection by your country. If you are located outside the United States and voluntarily submit personal information through the CMI website, you consent to the use of that information as provided by this Statement and to the transfer of that information to, and storage of that information in, the United States.  The personal information we collect is processed in accordance with this Statement and applicable law, wherever your information is located.

If we have collected data from you in the European Economic Area, the General Data Protection Regulation outlines your rights, including:

  * Access: You may access a copy of your personal information we have collected by contacting us.
  * Correct: To request that CMI update or correct your personal information, please contact us.
  * Delete: You may request that we remove your personal information from our systems by contacting us, although in some cases we may refuse your request in accordance with applicable law.
  * Restrict: To request that we restrict processing of your personal information, please contact us.
  * Object: You may object to CMI’s processing of your personal information by contacting us.
  * Withdraw: If we rely on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
  * Complain: If you have a concern about our privacy practices, including how we handle your personal information, you may report it to the Information Commissioner’s Office or other relevant data protection authority.


  8. Use of Cookies



Cookies are small text files that are placed either on your computer’s hard drive or in your computer’s random-access memory. We use cookies to make the CMI website easier to navigate, store visitor preferences, and record past activity to provide better service. Most browsers allow a user to accept or deny cookies. If you deny cookies, you may still use the CMI website, but certain website functions may not work properly.

The CMI website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., to collect and analyze information about how users use this website. Information generated by cookies about your use of the CMI website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google may transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.

  9. Do Not Track



Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. When a user turns on the Do Not Track preference, the browser sends signals to websites requesting them not to track the user. The CMI website does not recognize or respond to Do Not Track signals or similar mechanisms.

  10. Security



We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us in order to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information you have provided. The security measures used on the CMI website include, but are not limited to, industry-standard Secure Socket Layer technology, firewalls and internal policies to maintain the security of stored data. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or of electronic storage is 100 percent secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you are worried because your communication is very sensitive, do not send it electronically.

  11. Links to Third-Party Websites



The CMI website contains links to other websites that are owned or operated by third parties. In some cases, the CMI website may also include embedded tools or widgets that are provided and controlled by third parties, or that permit you to submit information to third parties (e.g. Facebook).  CMI is not able to protect your privacy once you leave the CMI website. When you visit other websites, check each one’s privacy policy yourself and be careful about the information you submit or share.

  12. How to Unsubscribe or Contact Us About Your Information



If you do not want to receive any email from us in the future, click the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of an email you have received. Note that your records will remain in CMI’s databases, but your email address will be deactivated.
