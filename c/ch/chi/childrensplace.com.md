**Do you have links to other sites?** |   
This site contains links to other sites such as Edgar Online and UPS.

We guarantee that every online transaction you make will be 100% safe. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at our online store. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any portion of this $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.  |   
**Cookies, what are they and how are they used?** |   
A cookie is a small data file that web sites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit their sites. We no longer use cookies on our site. If this policy changes, it will be noted here. |   
**What navigational information is collected on your site?** |   
We do not collect any navigational information on our site. If this policy changes, it will be noted here. |   
  
|   
**ORDERING ONLINE / SHIPPING / GIFTS** |   
  
|   
**How do I place an online order?** |   
Simply select the size and quantity of the item you would like and then click "Add to Shopping Bag." Once you are finished shopping, click on "checkout" and follow the instructions to process your order. **We strongly recommend that you place no more than 20 different items into your shopping bag. Adding more than 20 items may cause lengthy delays in the site response time you receive and may cause your shopping bag to be emptied.** |   
**What methods of payment do you accept?** |   
For your convenience, we accept all major charge cards for online purchases: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover/Novus. We do not accept payment by check, money order, cash, coupon or Gift Card for online purchases. |   
***************************************************************************************************************** |   
  
**Is the PLACE Card accepted online?** |   
We are working to make The Children's Place Credit Card (Place Card) available to you as a method of payment for online purchases. Our current payment processing software cannot process private label credit cards. We plan to have this enhancement to our system by Summer 2002. In the meantime, we welcome you to use another credit card for online purchases, and your Place Card, exclusively, when you shop at any of our store locations. Thank you for your patience.  
|   
***************************************************************************************************************** |   
**Will my credit card information be secure?** |   
The protection of your personal information is a priority to The Children's Place. That is why we have taken measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information you provide. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Protocol encryption technologies to ensure your information is encrypted while being transmitted over the internet. **Please note:** certain browsers and firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers.  |   
**How quickly will my order be shipped?** |   
All orders are processed and shipped by the next business day _after_ they are placed. Shipping times vary based on the chosen shipping method. Please see "What methods of shipment do you use?" for more information on shipping. |   
**What methods of shipment do you use?** |   
Shipping options include Standard delivery, 2nd Day Service and Next Day Service. Next Day Service and 2nd Day Service services are not available on shipments to P.O. boxes, U.S. Territories, APO or FPO addresses, and Canada. Such orders may be shipped via Standard delivery only. |   
********************************************************************************************************************* |   
**What if my order is a gift?** |   
You are welcome to place a gift order that will be shipped to a different address than your billing address. However, at this time, all purchases will include a packing slip with prices printed on it. Also, we are unfortunately not able to pack a gift order into a gift box or gift wrap it for delivery directly to a gift recipient. [(You may purchase unassembled Children's Place gift boxes](https://web.archive.org/web/20020409104050id_/http%3A//www.childrensplace.com/Products.jsp?Node=Features&NodeType=marketing&Node=Features_Feature97&NodeType=featureNumber&Regular=true) in which you may pack a gift which you intend to deliver yourself.) Lastly, we can not supply gift receipts and cannot add a gift message to your order. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you and are working to provide these "gifting" options before Summer 2002. |   
***************************************************************************************************************** |   
**Do you ship outside the US?** |   
Currently we only ship to addresses in the US (including addresses for the US Military and any US territory) and Canada. See tax notice to Canadian Customers. |   
**What are your shipping costs?** |   
The shipping charge on your order is based on the shipping method chosen and the total value of all merchandise purchased, not including tax and after application of coupon discounts. See table below for our regular shipping rates: |   
|  Merchandise Amount |  Standard Delivery |  2nd Day Service |  Next Day Service  
---|---|---|---  
$0.01 to $24.99 |  $5.00 |  $12.00 |  $20.00  
$25.00 - $49.99 |  $7.00 |  $14.00 |  $22.00  
$50.00 - $74.99 |  $9.00 |  $16.00 |  $24.00  
$75.00 and up |  $0.00 |  $7.00 |  $15.00  
  
  
********************************************************************************************************************* |   
**FREE STANDARD SHIPPING!** |   
**Get **FREE** Standard shipping on all orders of $75 or more (prior to tax and after application of coupon discounts).** |   
**Your FREE Standard shipping will be reflected on final checkout.**   
|   
********************************************************************************************************************* |   
**How long will it take for my order to arrive?** |   
All orders are shipped by the next business day _after_ they are placed. Therefore, Next Day Service orders will arrive within 2 business days after an order is placed and 2nd Day Service orders will arrive within 3 business days after an order is placed.

Standard delivery time is up to 7 business days from the shipping date. Standard delivery is via UPS Ground, except for orders to P.O. Boxes, Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. Territories, and APO or FPO addresses. Standard delivery to these locations is via US Mail. For more precise information on UPS Ground delivery times, please [click here](http://www.ups.com/wwtransit/engtimetran.html).

All orders are shipped from our fulfillment center in Secaucus, NJ 07094.

|   
**Will I be charged sales or other taxes?** |   
Federal law requires us to add the appropriate sales tax on any order shipped to a state where we operate a retail store (please visit our [Store Locator](https://web.archive.org/web/20020409104050id_/http%3A//www.childrensplace.com/StoreLocator.jsp) to identify the states with retail locations). Sales tax will be automatically calculated during checkout according to applicable local and state laws. **Please note:** some states require us to tax shipping charges as well as merchandise. **Notice to Canadian Customers:** We do not collect taxes on shipments to Canada. However, Canadian customers are responsible for paying directly to the relevant Canadian authorities any GST and all other taxes, import duties, customs changes, or tariffs which may be levied once an order arrives in Canada. |   
**Can I purchase or redeem Gift Cards online?** |   
Gift Cards for use in any of our retail locations may be purchased online in denominations of $25, $50, $75, and $100 by clicking on [gift ideas](https://web.archive.org/web/20020409104050id_/http%3A//www.childrensplace.com/Marketing.jsp?Node=GiftIdeas&NodeType=marketing). However, Gift Cards currently can _not_ be redeemed online.  |   
**Can I email my order to you?** |   
For the protection and security of your personal information, we do not accept orders via email. |   
**Can I cancel, update, or change an order after I place it?** |   
Unfortunately, once an order is completed and confirmed, it cannot be canceled, updated or changed. |   
**The contents of my Shopping Bag are being emptied. Why?** |   
If you close your web browser while shopping, your shopping session will be automatically terminated in order to protect you. This means that you will be logged out of our site and the contents of your Shopping Bag will be emptied. Additionally, you may empty the contents of your Shopping Bag by "removing" them. Finally, it is possible (though unlikely) that the contents of your Shopping Bag will be emptied without any action on your part. If this happens, try deleting all "cookies" that may have been set by the previous versions of our childrensplace.com or tcpkids.com web sites. Note that we currently do not use cookies and you may therefore safely delete all cookies set by us. Please consult the Help section of your web browser for instructions on deleting cookies.

Additionally, our site maintains a "session" for you. Sessions last approximately 30 minutes from when you enter our site. After the session "expires", any items in your shopping bag that are not purchased will be removed.

**We strongly recommend that you place no more than 20 different items into your shopping bag. Adding more than 20 items may cause lengthy delays in the site response time you receive and may cause your shopping bag to be emptied.**

**Please note:** our clothing surpasses the industry standards for shrinkage and color fastness. You do not need to buy a larger size than your child normally wears to allow for shrinkage.   
**How can I find what I am looking for online?** |   
The best way to find what you are looking for online is to browse our merchandise selection by category. First select a department (such as "big girls") at the top of the page and then select a merchandise category on the left-hand side of the page. (Be sure to allow the page to fully load.)

Alternatively, you can enter a description of the item you are looking for in the search box and click "go". If you know the SKU (or item number) of the item you are looking for, you may enter that into the search box. **Important:** When searching by SKU, it is possible that the SKU number in the search results will differ from the one you entered even though it is the correct item. This may occur because the SKU number for the same item may differ by size. Simply choose the correct size on the item description to make your purchase.

Be sure to also check out our clearance items. Clearance items can be found by merchandise category. Simply select a department and merchandise category, then click on "view clearance".

Unfortunately, if an item you are looking for does not appear in an appropriate category page as a regular or clearance item, then it is not available on childrensplace.com. Please note that childrensplace.com currently carries a limited selection of the merchandise available in our stores. 

  
|   
**How can I tell what the color of an item is?** |   
The quickest way to find the color name of an item you are looking at is to add the item to your shopping bag and then click on the [shopping bag](http://www.childrensplace.com/ShoppingCart.jsp). The color name will be listed next to the item name when reviewing the shopping bag content details. The color name will also be listed on the checkout page so that you can confirm that the color you are purchasing is the one you want before you complete your purchase. We recognize that this may be an inconvenient method of determining an item's color and are working on adding the color name to each item description page by Spring of 2002. |   
**Are all items on your site available? What if an item I order is not in stock?** |   
We update the availability of the items on our site in "real time". All items that you find on our site are available in the sizes that display in the dropdown box on the item description page. In rare circumstances (such as where two users purchase the last unit of an item almost simultaneously), it is possible that the item that was ordered will be unavailable to ship. In such an event, the item will be canceled from your order and you will be notified by email within two business days. The order status information under [My Place](https://web.archive.org/web/20020409104050id_/http%3A//www.childrensplace.com/Login.jsp) will also be updated. Unfortunately, due to the constantly changing product selection on our site, we are not able to "backorder" any sold-out items.  |   
**How do I care for the merchandise I purchase?** |   
Each of our garments comes with specific care instructions. To achieve the best results when laundering, we ask that you carefully follow the instructions on the care label.

**Please note:** our clothing surpasses the industry standards for shrinkage and color fastness. You do not need to buy a larger size than your child normally wears to allow for shrinkage. 

|   
|   
**RETURNS / EXCHANGES** |   
  
|   
**How do I return or exchange merchandise?** |   
There are two easy ways to return or exchange items purchased online.

**Returns/Exchanges at Retail Locations**

|   
  
|   
**Returns at childrensplace.com** |  |   
---|---  
  | Detach and complete the bottom portion of your packing slip. Please include your contact information in case we need to contact you regarding your return.  
|   
| 1.  Detach the pre-addressed return label at the bottom of the form and set aside.  
| 2.  Pack your merchandise with the return form securely inside.  
| 3.  Attach return label to the outside packet and ship it to us prepaid.  
|   
  | Refunds are issued only to the credit card used when the order was originally placed.  
  | If you are returning a gift and prefer to receive a Gift Card for the total amount rather than have the original purchaser's credit card refunded, please check the appropriate box on the return form.  
  | Unfortunately we cannot refund original or return shipping fees.  
  | Please note that exchanges cannot be processed online. If you would like to exchange an item, you must return the original item and place a new order separately.  
  | Returns sent directly to childrensplace.com should be sent to the following address:   
   childrensplace.com  
   Returns Department  
   45 Enterprise Way  
   Secaucus, NJ 07094  
  | **Important:** Merchandise purchased in our stores can _not_ be returned to the childrensplace.com return facility but may be returned to any of our stores.  
  
|   
**What do I do if I lost my packing slip/receipt?** |   
If you lost your packing slip, visit the [My PLACE](https://web.archive.org/web/20020409104050id_/http%3A//www.childrensplace.com/Login.jsp) section to research and print the order you're looking for. **Please note:** without a packing slip we'll gladly exchange your merchandise or issue you a Gift Card valued at the current selling price of the merchandise returned. |   
  
|   
**MY PLACE / CUSTOMER SERVICE** |   
  
|   
**What are the benefits of registering for My PLACE?** |   
Your profile is designed to make your online shopping experience easier and fun. So, why not personalize your shopping experience at childrensplace.com by registering with us? When you create a profile it allows you to view your order history/status; change your shipping/payment address information; and be eligible to receive advance notice of sales and special promotions. |

Please note that both email confirmations will be sent only to the email address listed under Payment Information.  |   
**I was registered on the previous version of your web site. Do I need to re-register?** |   
Yes. Unfortunately, none of the registration information from the previous version of our web site will be transferred to the new site. Please [register on this new site](https://web.archive.org/web/20020409104050id_/http%3A//www.childrensplace.com/Login.jsp).

Simply visit the [My PLACE](https://web.archive.org/web/20020409104050id_/http%3A//www.childrensplace.com/Login.jsp) section, login and choose the options you would like to change.  |   
**What can I do if my Gift Card or Merchandise Credit is lost or stolen?** |   
Unfortunately Gift Cards and Merchandise Credits are like cash and can be redeemed by anyone. Therefore, The Children's Place and childrensplace.com cannot replace lost or stolen Gift Cards or Merchandise Credits. A transaction receipt is not redeemable in place of the original Gift Card or Merchandise Credit. **Please Note:** All merchandise credits are given in the form of a Gift Card.
