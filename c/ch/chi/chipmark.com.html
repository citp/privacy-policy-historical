        The privacy practices of this statement apply to our services available under the
        domain and sub-domains of www.chipmark.com (the "Site"). By visiting this website,
        you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you
        do not agree, please do not use or access our Site.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect from you as part of the
        normal operation of our services and what may happen to that information. Although
        this policy may seem long, we have prepared a detailed policy because we believe
        you should know as much as possible about Chipmark's practices so that you can make
        informed decisions.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in registration, you expressly
        consent to our use and disclosure of your anonymous information in accordance with
        this Privacy Policy. Chipmark will never release your personal information to anyone
        for any reason. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms
        of the Chipmark User Agreement. This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance
        in registration for new registering users, and is otherwise effective on October
        31st, 2004 for all users. The previous amendment to this Privacy Policy was effective
        for all users on October 31st, 2004.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_header">
        Definitions</p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        Information collected online is usually defined as being either anonymous or personally
        identifiable.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        Anonymous Information refers to data that cannot be tied back to a specific individual.
        For example, Chipmark collects some information each time a visitor comes to Chipmark's
        site, so we can improve the overall quality of the visitor's online experience.
        Chipmark collects the visitor's IP address (i.e., whether the user is logged on
        from ibm.com or aol.com), referral data (i.e., the Internet address of the last
        Web page visited by a user before clicking over to the Chipmark site), and browser
        and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). You do not
        have to register with Chipmark before we can collect this anonymous information.
        Chipmark's collection of bookmark information (e.g. url, name, description, hit
        count, etc.) is also considered anonymous information.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        Personally Identifiable Information refers to data that tells us specifically who
        you are, such as your name and postal address, which may be collected in addition
        to the anonymous data described in the above paragraph.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_header">
        Cookies</p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier,
        that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's
        hard drive.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences
        allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access
        the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_header">
        Choices about cookies</p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify
        you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of
        your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)
    </p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Chipmark products or services
        that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of
        all offerings. However, many Chipmark products and services do not require that
        you accept cookies.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_header">
        Chipmark's practices regarding cookies</p>
    <p class="sub_content">

    <p class="sub_header">
        The information we collect</p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Chipmark website.
        On some pages, you can register for our Web bookmarks service. The types of personal
        information collected at these pages are:
        <br>
        Email address<br>
        A valid e-mail address is required at resistration for the purpose of retrieving
        your password should you forget it. On some pages, you can submit Web bookmark information.
        Under this circumstance, no personal information is collected.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_header">
        The way we use information</p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and
        to share with researchers. For example, we may tell a researcher that X number of
        individuals visited a certain website, or that Y number of users filled out our
        registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify
        those individuals.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        We use your email address provided during registration only to contact you about
        important information related to Chipmark or to send you a lost password. Currently
        we don't disseminate information by email. Should we ever decide to do this you
        will have the option to receive emails or decline them.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are
        not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided
        to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing
        you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_header">
        Our commitment to children's privacy</p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason,
        we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know
        are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_header">
        Our commitment to data security</p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use
        of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
        procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_header">
        Use of email tools</p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        You may not use the "Email This Item to a Friend" service or other email services
        that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our User
        Agreement. We do not permanently store email messages or the email addresses sent
        from these tools.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        If you send and email using the Email This Item to a Friend service to an email
        address that is not registered in our community, we do not use that email address
        for any purpose other than to send your email. We do not rent or sell these email
        addresses.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_header">
        Use of other user's information</p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        In order to facilitate Web browsing, Chipmark allows you limited access to other
        users' Web bookmark information. As a member, you do not have access to other user's
        personal information.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        By entering into our User Agreement, you agree that, with respect to other users'
        anonymous information that you obtain through the Site, Chipmark hereby grants to
        you a license to use such information only for: (a)Web browsing.
    </p>
    <p class="sub_header">
        Control of your password</p>
    <p class="sub_content">
        You are responsible for all actions taken with your user id and password. Therefore,
        we do not recommend that you disclose your Chipmark password to any third parties.
        If you choose to share your user id and password or your personal information with
        third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account. If you
        lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal
        information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.
        Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately
        change your password in the account section of your members area.
