# Chipotle — Privacy Policy

## CHIPOTLE’S PRIVACY POLICY

###### (LAST UPDATED MAY 22, 2018)

Thank you for visiting Chipotle online. This Privacy Policy describes how Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, "Chipotle", “we” or “our”) collect, use and disclose personal information of visitors to our websites, users of our online services and others to whom we expressly provide that this Privacy Policy will apply.

###### The Information Chipotle Collects and How We Use this Information

Chipotle only obtains personally identifiable information such as your name, email address and payment card or other information when you provide it voluntarily. For example, personal information may be collected from you to:

  * respond to your comments regarding a Chipotle restaurant, our websites, or other aspects of Chipotle;
  * register you for our mailing lists or as a user of online or mobile products or services we offer, or to register you for promotions or offers conducted through our websites or mobile campaigns;
  * transmit payment information for online or mobile orders;
  * respond to job inquiries and job applications submitted by you; and 
  * respond to other information submitted by you to any of our websites or through any of our mobile campaigns.



This information will be used for the purposes for which you provide it. We may also use this information to communicate with you from time to time for other purposes, such as to create personalized promotions by combining your personal information with non-personal information about you, such as the amounts and types of purchases you make or any benefits you receive through our programs.

We may also use information you provide us for additional purposes as described under “Sharing of Personal Information.”

In addition to personally identifiable information about you, Chipotle may collect aggregated data or anonymized data that does not directly identify you. For example, we may automatically collect website use information, such as information about your Internet service provider, your operating system, browser type, domain name, Internet protocol (IP) address, your access times, the website that referred you to us, the Web pages you request, and the date and time of those requests.

###### California's Do Not Track Notice

Chipotle does not support Do Not Track browser settings and does not currently participate in any Do Not Track frameworks that would allow any of our sites to respond to signals or other mechanisms from you regarding the collection of your personal information.  However, our sites do not track any personally identifiable information on our sites unless you intentionally provide it to us (such as when you create an account, opt-in to our marketing lists, or make a purchase).

###### DISPUTE RESOLUTION, ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER

You agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise relating in any way to or arising out of this Privacy Policy will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Dispute Resolution section. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED. You agree that whenever you have a disagreement with Chipotle arising out of, connected to, or in any way related to this Privacy Policy, you will send a written notice to Chipotle (“Demand”). You agree that the requirements of this Dispute Resolution section will apply even to disagreements that may have arisen before you accepted this Privacy Policy. You must send the Demand to the following address (the “Notice Address”): Legal Department, Chipotle Mexican Grill c/o CMG Strategy Co., LLC, 1401 Wynkoop Street, Suite 500, Denver, CO 80202. **You agree that you will not take any legal action, including filing a lawsuit or demanding arbitration, until 20 business days after you send a Demand.** If the disagreement stated in the Demand is not resolved to your satisfaction within 10 business days after it is received, and you intend on taking legal action, you agree that you will file a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (the “Arbitrator”). **This arbitration provision limits the ability of you and Chipotle to litigate claims in court and you and Chipotle each agree to waive your respective rights to a jury trial or a state or federal judge.** There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow this Privacy Policy as a court would. **You agree that you will not file any lawsuit against Chipotle in any state or federal court. You agree that if you do sue in state or federal court, and Chipotle brings a successful motion to compel arbitration, you must pay all fees and costs incurred by Chipotle in court, including reasonable attorney’s fees.** For any such filing of a demand for arbitration, you must effect proper service under the rules of the Arbitrator and notice to the Notice Address may not be sufficient. If, for any reason, the American Arbitration Association is unable to conduct the arbitration, you may file your case with any national arbitration company. The Arbitrator shall apply the AAA Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedure effective September 15, 2005 (as may be amended) and as modified by the agreement to arbitrate in this Dispute Resolution section. **You agree that the Arbitrator will have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute you have with Chipotle.** The Federal Arbitration Act allows for the enforcement of arbitration agreements and governs the interpretation and enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate.

**You agree that you will not file a class action or collective action against** **Chipotle,** **and that you will not participate in a class action or collective action against them. You agree that you will not join your claims to those of any other person.** Notwithstanding any other provision in this Privacy Policy, if this class action waiver is invalidated, then the agreement to arbitrate is null and void, as though it were never entered into, and any arbitration dispute at that time will be dismissed without prejudice and may be refiled in a court. Under no circumstances do you or Chipotle agree to class or collective procedures in arbitration or the joinder of claims in arbitration. Chipotle agrees that we will submit all disputes with you to arbitration before the Arbitrator.

With your permission, we will send marketing information to you, such as promotional offers or information about new product offerings, programs or restaurant openings. If you do not want to receive this stuff, you can contact us to opt out and we will not send it to you thereafter. Also with your permission, we may occasionally send marketing information to you on behalf of one of our business partners. On our websites, in our restaurants, or elsewhere, we may ask if you want to receive marketing materials from our business partners. If you want to receive this stuff, we’ll send it to you… if you don’t want it, just tell us and you won’t get it. But remember, Chipotle will not share your personal information with any of its business partners. We will just send a mailing, e-mail, text message or similar communication on behalf of the business partner.

Chipotle sometimes contacts other companies for a variety of reasons, such as fulfilling orders, assisting with promotions, and providing technical services for our websites. These companies may have access to personal information if they need it to do their work. However, we will generally obligate these companies to use any personal information only for the purpose of performing their work.

We may, where expressly stated, post certain submissions on our websites. However, we will not include your full name or other personal information identifying you unless you have given us consent to do so

We keep your job inquiries and job applications confidential. However, we may share personal information within our affiliated companies for purposes of evaluating you as a candidate for any openings.

Chipotle does reserve the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any law enforcement or similar investigation.

Finally, we may also share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.

###### Chipotle’s Privacy Policy Regarding Children

Chipotle is very sensitive to privacy issues regarding kids. We do not intend our websites to collect personal information from kids under the age of 13.
