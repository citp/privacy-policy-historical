# Privacy Policy - Childcare.co.uk

We are extremely concerned to protect your privacy and confidentiality. We understand that all users of our site are quite rightly concerned to know that their data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them, and will not fall into the hands of a third party. Our policy is both specific and strict. If you think our policy falls short of your expectations or that we are failing to abide by our policy, do please tell us.

Information may be unlawfully available to hackers and snoopers. We take no responsibility for this. The risk is no different from a similar risk in a bricks and mortar establishment. Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any personally identifiable information collected at this site. If this policy should change in the future (most unlikely), then we shall provide notification in advance, and the opportunity for all users to indicate whether or not they would prefer that we do not provide the information to third parties as proposed.

Here is a list of the information we collect, and why it is necessary to collect it:

#### 1\. Basic identification and contact information, such as your name and contact details.

This information is used:

1.1 to provide you with the services which you request  
1.2 to maintain our accounts;  
1.3 for billing;  
1.4 to enable us to answer your enquiries;  
1.5 for verifying your identity for security purposes;  
1.6 for marketing our services and products;  
1.7 to help make our web site as useful to you as possible;  
1.8 information which does not identify any individual may be used in a general way by us or third parties, to provide class information, for example relating to demographics or usage of a particular page or service.

#### 2\. Your domain name and email address

are recognised by our servers and the pages that you visit are recorded. This information is used:

2.1 in a collective way not referable to any particular individual, for the purpose of quality control and improvement of our site;

2.2 to send you news about the services to which you have signed up. For example we may send you an email when you have received a message from another user or when your profile has been viewed;

2.3 to send you news and marketing emails about our services

If you optionally choose to display your email address or other contact details in the Profile Plus section of your profile then this information will be available to be viewed by childcare.co.uk gold members.

Even if you choose not to complete a childcare.co.uk profile, the screen name that you enter during the registration process may be seen by other users.

We will never share or sell your email address with third parties unless you have specifically given us permission to do so.

#### 3\. Financial information, including credit card details

This information is used to obtain payment for goods and services you have ordered from us. This information is never actually received by us. The page where this information is given by you is controlled by our contract merchant service provider, PayPal. Such information is automatically encrypted, and later decrypted for use. It never touches our system. We do not store any financial information in our systems such as your credit card or debit card number or expiry date.

#### 4\. Your childcare.co.uk personal profile

Is available to be seen by visitors throughout the world. Your profile may get indexed by search engines such as Google. For safety and security reasons we recommend that you choose a screen name that is not your real name. No contact details are given out in your profile unless you choose to complete the optional Profile Plus information which is only available to Gold members. Information, which does not identify any individual may be used in a general way by us or third parties, to provide class information, for example relating to demographics or usage of a particular page or service. Some of this information is classified as sensitive information by the UK Data Protection Act 1998. We make the assumption that in giving this information to us, you consent to our holding it for the duration of your membership.

#### 5\. Information volunteered by you

for a particular purpose, for example a personal profile or registration form. This information will be used exclusively for the purpose for which you have provided it. Information is disclosed to third parties only where the third party concerned qualifies in whatever way the web site page requires.

#### 6\. Business information

This is information given to us in the course of your business and ours such as in relation to your application to partner with us or advertise with us. Such information is retained for business use only. We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the information and of the terms of our relationship. It is not used for any other purpose. We expect you and any partner to reciprocate this policy.

#### 7\. Disclosure to Government

and their agencies. We are subject to the law like everyone else. We may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.
