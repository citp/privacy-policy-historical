# Privacy Policy - Chimpoo.com - a free online virtual world for kids!

Modified on August 04, 2013

The Site [www.chimpoo.com](http://www.chimpoo.com/) is owned and operated by Games2win India Pvt. Ltd.

This Privacy Policy covers use of information collected by Chimpoo.com 

As described in this Privacy Policy, we directly collect from child users during our initial registration process a parent's email address, the child's account name, and the child's password. When a Chimpoo.com child registrant acquires a paid membership, we may collect additional personally identifiable information ("PII") from the registrant's parent. The types of PII that may be collected at that time include the parent's full name, email address, and credit card billing information including mailing address.

The Chimpoo.com website requires child users to provide a parent's valid email address in order to register on the website. We use this information to send the parent a message that can be used to activate the Chimpoo.com account, to notify the parent about our privacy practices, to send the parent communications either about the parent’s and child’s Chimpoo.com accounts or about features of our Web site, and for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This email address is correlated with the account user name.

We may also request a user name and email address when a user submits a form through the "Contact Us" portion of the Chimpoo.com website so that we may respond to the inquiry. We collect the e-mail address for the sole purpose of responding directly on a one-time basis to a specific inquiry. Once we have fulfilled your request we will delete the information immediately. 

For some of our online activities - such as polls or surveys - we may ask users to provide information that is not personally identifiable, such as country of residence or a visitor's favorite color. We may offer in-game chat, blogs or other Public Forums (as defined in the Terms of Use governing the website (the "Terms of Use")), as well as other features in which you may provide us with Submissions (as defined in the Terms of Use), but we take measures, including live moderation, so that users cannot communicate personal information through these Public Forums.

Additionally, when visitors come to our site, we may passively collect certain non-personally identifiable computer information, such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the user's IP Address, the web browser (e.g. Internet Explorer, Firefox) being used, the frequency with which guests visit various parts of our sites, and information regarding the Internet service provider, in order to make our sites more interesting and useful to you and for various purposes related to our business. We may collect this non-personal information through the use of software technologies such as unique identifiers or "cookies." Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your Web experience smoother, and some of our services may not function properly. The cookies on our site are linked to personal information. Third parties also place tracking technologies on our site, of which the data is only collected in the aggregate.

Finally, we collect financial information as set out in Section 5 of this Privacy Policy. We do not use this financial information for any purpose other than processing payments to Chimpoo.com. The financial information that you enter to purchase a membership is not stored by Chimpoo.com, but, instead, is retained by our payments processing vendor for the purpose of processing credit card payments made to Chimpoo.com.

If personal information is not provided to us, then Chimpoo.com may not agree to Chimpoo.com membership and may not be able to provide access to certain content and functionality on the Chimpoo.com website, or to provide other information, products or services which may be requested.

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program

_Agents/Service Providers_

We use other third parties such as a shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services, an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf. We use Live Chat to assist you if you have questions while using our site or regarding your order. When you sign up for these services, we will share your personal information as necessary for the third party to provide that service.

In addition to the purposes described in Section 1, we may actively collect and use email addresses and user names to track usage and to ensure users are following the site's Terms of Use. In addition, we may use an email address and user name to ban a user temporarily or permanently from the Chimpoo.com website if that user engages in inappropriate conduct on the site. We may also use email addresses and user names to enable parents to review PII that the children have submitted to the Chimpoo.com website and to provide notification regarding the site, such as any future amendments to this Privacy Policy. We also may use information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services.

We may disclose information where we are required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena, or where we disclose information to service providers or other group companies who provide support for the operations of our website and who do not use or disclose the information for any other purpose. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose PII in response to a law enforcement agency's or other public agency's (including schools or children services) request or if we feel that such disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our website, protect the security or integrity of our website, or enable us to take precautions against liability.

If we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of our assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may transfer PII to a third party as part of that transaction, to the extent permitted by applicable law. You will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. 

Finally, we may transfer PII and store it outside of the jurisdiction in which a member of Chimpoo.com is located.
