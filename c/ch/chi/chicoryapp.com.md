## How We Protect Your Information

We take appropriate security steps to protect the information we collect for you from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.  However, no security system is immune to problems.  We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Platform may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.
