# Privacy Policy

Effective 24th November 2008

### Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

### The Information We Collect:

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on this website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:

Name  
Address  
Email address  
Phone number

On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are:

Name  
Address  
Phone Number

We use a third party payment gateway to process payments on this web site. This means we never store your credit or debit card details anywhere in our database. This information is collected by the payment processor and used for the purposes of processing your transaction.

### Personal information

We value our customers, and our priority is to ensure your personal information is secure and your privacy is respected. We collect customer information when you place an order online, in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products and promotions. In addition, you may elect to sign up to receive email updates about our products and promotions.  
We collect personal information only when you voluntarily submit the information and we most definitely do not sell or rent the information you provide to us to third parties. When you make an online purchase from us, we use your information to process your order. We will also send you emails to confirm your order, and we may need to contact you by telephone, email or regular post if we have other questions regarding your order.  
If at any time you would like us to remove you from our email mailing list or registration database, please contact us via email, including your full name and the email address used when accessing or ordering from our site.  
We may contain links to other sites that are not under our control. These web sites have their own policies regarding privacy, which you should review before visiting them. We have no responsibility for linked web sites and provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.

###   
Payment security

We use the AW Payment Service Provider system. All transaction information passed between merchant sites and the AW systems are encrypted using 128-bit SSL certificates. Sounds complicated, we know. You can feel secure in the knowledge that nothing you pass to the AW servers can be examined, used or modified by third parties attempting to gain access to sensitive information. Your details are not disclosed to any third parties without your consent.

At all times, we will offer you the opportunity to unsubscribe out of any service or update to which you have subscribed, if you change your mind.
