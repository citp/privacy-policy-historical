**Chi Health Privacy Policy**

Chi Health understands how important the privacy of personal information is to our users. This Privacy Policy will tell you what information we collect about you and about your use of Chi Health and its services. It will explain the choices you have about how your personal information is used and how we protect that information. We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully.

This Privacy Policy applies to Web sites owned and operated by Chi Health that are intended for use by consumers (non-professionals) for non-commercial personal, family or household purposes, including ChiHealth.in, StepUpToLife.com, and others including the mobile optimized versions of these sites (we refer to these sites collectively as the "Chi Health Web Sites"). However, if you are an employee or health plan member who has enabled access to your health record at ChiHealth.in by registering at your employer’s or health plan’s website, the privacy policy applicable to your information at your employer’s or health plan’s website remains applicable to your personal health record at ChiHealth.in. If your employer or health plan account is no longer made available to you by your employer or health plan, you will continue to have access to your health information from ChiHealth.in, using the same username and password, but will be subject to this Privacy Policy. Except where noted, statements in this Privacy Policy with respect to the Chi Health Web Sites also apply to the Chi Health Mobile Device Application (or "App") for the iOS, Android, Windows and Blackberry operating systems.

Inaccurate information will affect your experience when using the Chi Health Web Sites and tools and our ability to contact you as described in this Privacy Policy. 

**Registration**

Access to some Chi Health interactive tools and services may be limited to users who have registered. Some of our tools (such as certain quizzes or calculators) do not retain your Personal Information, while others store your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the authorization you provide at the time you submit Personal Information in order to use the tool.

When our market research surveys collect Personal Information we will not knowingly accept participants who are under the age of 13.

Chi Health features several community areas and other public forums where users with similar interests or medical conditions can share information and support one another or where users can post questions for experts to answer. We also offer online discussions moderated by healthcare experts. Our communities are open to the public and should not be considered private.

**Any information (including Personal Information) you share in any online community area including a chat room, Health Community, Ask Our Expert posting or online discussion is by design open to the public and is not private. You should think carefully before posting any Personal Information in any public forum. What you post can be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we cannot control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes. As with any public forum on any site, the information you post may also show up in third-party search engines.**

**If you mistakenly post Personal Information in our Community areas and would like it removed, you can send us an email to request that we remove it by using the _Contact Us_ link on the Chi Health Web Sites.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information, content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to Chi Health by email. If you want to keep content or business information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them in an email to Chi Health.

**Non-Personal Information**

Even if you do not register with or provide any Personal Information to Chi Health, we collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the Chi Health Web Sites. "Non-Personal Information" means information that we cannot use to identify or contact you. We may also acquire Non-Personal Information about our users from external sources. While you may use some of the functionality of Chi Health without registration, many of the specific tools and services on the Chi Health Web Sites require that you register with Chi Health.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

We collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the Chi Health Web Sites and your use of other web sites through the use of Cookies and Web Beacons. "Cookies" are small data files that are stored on the hard drive of the computer you use to view a web site. Every computer that accesses the Chi Health Web Sites is assigned a different cookie by Chi Health. "Web Beacons" are graphic image files imbedded in a web page typically used to monitor activity on a web page and send back to its home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other third party) information from your browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the beacon is located, the type browser that is accessing the site and the ID number of any Cookies on your computer previously placed by that server. 

Third parties under contract with Chi Health may use Cookies or Web Beacons to collect Non-Personal Information about your usage of the Chi Health Web Sites, including which health topics you have viewed. These third party advertising service providers may use this information, on our behalf, to help Chi Health deliver advertising on the Chi Health Web Sites as well as on other sites on the Internet based on your browsing activity on our sites. Chi Health may further tailor the advertising on these third party sites based on additional Non-Personal Information to the extent known by Chi Health or these third parties.

**Mobile Device Applications ("Apps")**

When you download and install one of our Chi Health Mobile Apps onto your mobile device we assign a random number to your App installation. This number cannot be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the App. We use this random number in a manner similar to our use of Cookies as described in this Privacy Policy. Unlike Cookies, the random number is assigned to your installation of the App itself and not a browser, because the App does not work through your browser. Therefore the random number cannot be removed through settings. If you do not want us to use the random number for the purposes for which we use Cookies, please do not use the Mobile Device App, and please use your mobile device browser to access the Chi Health Web Sites or our mobile optimized sites. We do not obtain any information about your mobile device, other than the brand, make and model and type of operating software your device uses. Please note that certain Chi Health Mobile Apps require registration either to use the App or to use certain functionality in the App. 

**Non-Personal Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on Chi Health’s Behalf**

We work with third parties to display advertising that reflects the interests and preferences of our user community. Sponsors or advertisers on the Chi Health Web Sites may use their own Cookies, Web Beacons or other online tracking technologies in the banner advertisements served on the Chi Health Web Sites and in emails, special promotions or newsletters we send you. Their advertisements may be displayed on the Chi Health Web Sites or on other sites that you visit after you visit the Chi Health Web Sites. Some advertisers use companies other than Chi Health to serve their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of Cookies or Web Beacons on the Chi Health Web Sites. 

We do not control how third parties use Cookies or Web Beacons or how they manage the Non-Personal Information they gather through the use of these technologies on the Chi Health Web Sites.
