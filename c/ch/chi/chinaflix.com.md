COFX uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the COFX Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

When you use the COFX Site, we may employ "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our Members anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our Members to track which emails are opened by recipients.

  * monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.;
  * track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions and contests;

Surveys and polls

COFX values opinions and comments from members, so we may conduct online surveys. Participation in these surveys is entirely optional. Typically, the information is aggregated and used to make improvements to COFX and to develop appealing content, features and promotions for members. Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey.

We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the COFX Site and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.

We may use anonymous data for purposes of research or analysis. We may conduct research on our customer demographics, internet usage, and interests and behavior based on personal data we gather. Although anonymous data may be based in part on personal data, it does not identify you personally.
