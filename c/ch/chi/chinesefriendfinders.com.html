          <b>2. About Asia Friendfinder and Information We Collect</b><br>
	  Asia Friendfinder is an online network which provides you 
useful tools and communities to build relationships online. 
Asia Friendfinder basic service is FREE to all qualified members. 
<br><br>
In our online registration form, we ask you to provide us with certain 
information such as your birth date and the type of relationship you are 
looking for. In addition, we collect address, credit card, and bank 
information only from those who wish to acquire Gold and Silver member 
privileges. 
<br><br>
At your own discretion, you may choose to post additional facts about 
yourself on your profile, such as your occupation, level of education, 
religious denomination, marital status, etc. While some members freely elect 
to include their names in their profile, it is not requested or required, 
and the Asia Friendfinder Terms of Service forbids posting personal 
contact information for any reason.
<br>
In addition to standard business contact information, American individuals 
and companies signing up for Asia Friendfinder's Affiliate Program 
must provide URL information for their website(s) and a social security or 
Tax I.D. number. None of this information can be accessed or used by 
individuals not under the direct employ of Asia Friendfinder Inc.
<br><br>
In the course of using our site, we automatically track certain information 
such as your IP addresses and email addresses. Many sites collect this sort 
of information. We may tie your IP address to your personally identifiable 
information. If you choose to post messages in our Advice Columns, chat 
rooms or other message areas, we will only display such information about 
you as you choose to reveal. If you use a bulletin board or chat room on 
this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information 
you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these 
forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Once posted, 
you cannot change or remove any public postings made in our chat rooms or 
other message areas. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable 
information you choose to submit in these forums. We reserve the right to 
terminate the accounts of visitors who use these services in a manner 
inconsistent with our Terms of Use.
<br><br>
If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if 
other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities 
or postings on the site, we may collect such information into a file which 
is only accessed by authorized personnel. We may also collect other users' 
comments about you in our complaints department.
<br><br>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, 
we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We may 
automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to 
visit the site. FriendFinder stores this information for the sole purpose 
of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral 
program. Your friend may contact us at 
</a><a href="mailto:team@asiafriendfinder.com">team@asiafriendfinder.com</a> to request that we remove 
this information from our database.
<br><br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information 
about the user. We use session ID cookies. A session ID cookie simply 
terminates once a user closes the browser. Some of our business partners 
use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no 
access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for 
them to set cookies for advertising.
