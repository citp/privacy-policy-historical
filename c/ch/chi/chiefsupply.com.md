We collect aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, information volunteered by the consumer, such as contact requests or on-line orders.

## How We Use Contact Information 

The information we collect is used to notify consumers about issues with his or her order or if they have opted in to our newsletter, updates to our Website.

If another entity acquires us or substantially all of our assets, the personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information we have about you will be transferred to and used by this acquiring entity. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such, may be sold or transferred to third parties.

When we offer contests, promotions or feedback surveys, you may be required to provide certain personal information in order to participate. In these cases, we will give you the choice not to receive email messages or other communications from us regarding our products, services, contests, and promotions. We may use your contact information to reach you about the sweepstakes or contest.
