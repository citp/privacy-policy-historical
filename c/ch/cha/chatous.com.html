<h1>Chatous Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Welcome to the web site (the “Site”) of Chatous, Inc. (“Chatous” “we,” “us” and/or “our”). This Site is operated by Chatous and has been created to provide information about our company and our chat room platform, mobile applications and related services (together with the Site, the “Services”) to our Service visitors (“you”, “your”). Chatous is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy details important information regarding the use and disclosure of information collected from visitors to the Site and Services, including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”). By using Chatous, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

          <b>1. Information We Collect</b>
          <p>When you interact with us through the Services, Chatous may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p> 
          <b>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services:</b>
          <p>We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, for example when you register with us, engage in a chat, add information to your profile, or if you send us an email. Wherever Chatous collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. </p>

          <p><b>If you choose to provide such information, you are giving Chatous permission to use and store that information consistent with this policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Chatous and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.</b></p>

          <p><b>Location Information: </b>Our Service may collect and use your location information (for example, by using the IP address on your computer or the GPS on your mobile device) to provide certain functionality of our Service. If you choose to enable our location features, your location information may be publicly displayed within the Service. Please keep in mind that other users can see this information about you, and they may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities outside of our control and without your knowledge. Your location information may be subject to abuse, misuse, and monitoring by others, so please be careful if you choose to enable location functionality. We may also use your location information in an aggregate way, as described above in the “Aggregated Data” section.</p>

          <p><b>Chat Data: </b>In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Chatous often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Chatous may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Chatous may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

In addition, if you come to the Site via a link from another site, we may also track the source of that link. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Chatous may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Chatous affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.</p>

          <p><b>Information Regarding “Cookies”: </b>Like many other websites, Chatous may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. We use cookies to improve our Site and make it easier to use. Cookies permit us to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information. Chatous may use cookies to track user traffic patterns as described above. Chatous may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Chatous. Persistent cookies can be removed. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser, however, some features on the Chatous may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Please review your web browser “Help” file to modify your cookie settings. </p>

          <b>2. Information From Other Sources</b>
          <p>We may collect information about you from other sources, including from partners, and from commercially available sources (such as data aggregators and public databases). The following are examples of information we may collect from other sources:</p>
          <p>Data you authorize us to access through your use of Facebook Connect.  In general, the types and amount of Personal Data we collect vary depending on the activity.

          <b>3. Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information</b>
          <p>Chatous uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.

We may share your Personal Data with companies that provide services to us, including outside vendors, contractors, or agents who help us manage our business activities. Such entities only use your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and for no other purpose than to provide us with necessary services. Chatous may disclose Personal Data if required to do so by law or under the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (including, without limitation, U.S. copyright or trademark laws) or respond to a court order, subpoena, judicial or other governmental requirement or warrant in a manner required by the requesting entity. Chatous also reserves the right to disclose Personal Data that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; enforce our Terms of Service; protect Chatous from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to initiate, render, bill and collect for amounts owed to Chatous; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Site; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Chatous, our Users, or others.  As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.  Chatous may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
