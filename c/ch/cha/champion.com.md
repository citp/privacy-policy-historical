# The home equity lenders at Champion Mortgage are committed to your privacy

Privacy is an important issue. We provide this Policy as required by law to explain our information practices. It applies to the Key family of companies listed at the end of this Policy. Please read and retain this Policy to learn how we collect and use information about you, and your rights to limit the sharing and use of information.

**How do we protect information?**  
KeyCorp ("Key") does not share customer information about you outside of the Key family of companies, except as permitted by law. Key has strict standards and procedures designed to prevent unauthorized access to information. We apply these standards and procedures to our facilities and online services. Our safeguards meet or exceed federal standards for protecting consumer information. We permit only authorized employees, who have been trained in the proper handling of information, to have access to that information. If an employee were to violate Key's privacy procedures, they would be subject to disciplinary action.  


**What are your options?**  
Telling us not to share or use information is called "opting out". Key automatically opts you out of external information sharing with third parties outside Key. Key will not disclose information about you to third parties, except as permitted by law. You can also tell us not to share certain information within the Key family of companies, and not to use information for marketing purposes across the Key family of companies. You may also request that we not solicit you.

**How do you exercise your options?**   
The **"YOUR OPTIONS"** section explains how to opt out of internal information sharing, limit internal use of information for marketing purposes, and restrict solicitations. 

**What if you have already told us your preferences?**  
If you do not wish to change your preferences, you do not need to do anything. Your previously recorded opt out and solicitation elections will stay in effect until you change them.

_This Policy applies to individuals who inquire about and/or obtain products or services from Key for personal, family and household purposes. This Policy describes information practices across Key. However, departments and/or companies within Key may have more restrictive information sharing practices._

_This Policy supersedes all previous notices or statements about practices described in this Policy. You should retain a copy of this Policy for your records. If Key materially changes our Policy, we will notify customers (who maintain an active relationship with Key) and prominently place a notification on our website. Active customers will receive an annual notification, as required by law. You may request a current copy of the Policy at any time by calling our toll free Privacy Line at 1-800-361-0968 or visiting our website at Key.com ®._

**SHARING AND USING INFORMATION**

Key reserves the right to share and/or use all information we collect as this Policy describes. We do not share information about you with third parties outside of Key, except as permitted by law. 

**Types of Information**  
**Personal Private Information** \- non-public personal information that you provide to Key (e.g., birth date, marital status, employer and salary) or Key obtains from a third party (e.g., credit bureau).   
**Transaction and Experience Information** \- information Key develops from our relationship with you (e.g., account number, account balances and payment history).  
**Identification Information** \- information Key obtains regarding your identification (e.g., name, address, telephone number and Social Security number). 

**Sharing Information with Outside Companies (External Sharing)**  
We do not provide information about you to third parties outside of Key, except as permitted by law. When Key does disclose information about you to third parties under the limited legal exceptions, the third parties are required to treat the information they receive about you in strict confidence; to use it only for the purpose for which it was shared; and not to use the information for their own marketing purposes. Key does not sell information about you to third parties. 

In addition to the "Additional Opt Out Exceptions" listed below, Key may from time to time share information to jointly market other financial institutions' products and services (e.g., mortgage bankers/brokers, insurance agents/companies, securities broker/dealers, indirect loan originators, correspondent lenders and transaction processors). 

**Sharing Information within Key (Internal Sharing)**  
Key engages in several businesses (e.g., banking, mortgage lending, brokerage and investment services, trust administration, asset management and insurance). We may share Personal Private, Transaction and Experience, as well as Identification Information internally to prevent fraud, enhance services, and tailor products and services. Employees are only authorized to share information when a "business need to know" exists. 

Even if you opt out of internal information sharing within Key, we may share information that identifies you and share information on our transactions and experiences with you. 

**Using Information within Key for Marketing Purposes (Marketing Use)**  
Personal Private, and Transaction and Experience Information may be used for marketing purposes within the Key family of companies. Information may be used to design and offer products or services that may benefit you based on your financial needs or preferences. Employees are authorized to access information only when a "business need to know" exists.

Even if you opt out of using information for marketing purposes, Key may use information for the following:

  * To market to an individual who has a pre-existing business relationship; 
  * To market to an individual who had a business relationship within the past 18 months; and 
  * To respond to an application or inquiry about a product or service. 



**ADDITIONAL OPT OUT EXCEPTIONS**  
It is important to understand that even if you opt out, in addition to those exceptions listed above, Key may continue to share or use information about you for the following:

  * To perform services (e.g., check printing, loan servicing, printing statements, bill payment, e-mail services and mail house services); 

  * To process your account or enforce your agreement with us; 

  * To protect the rights, property or safety of Key, our customers or others (e.g., to protect against fraud and to reduce credit risk); 

  * To comply with a legal requirement or process (e.g., subpoena or court order); 

  * To comply with your request or authorization to share information; and 

  * To furnish information to consumer reporting agencies. 




**FORMER CUSTOMERS**  
If you end your relationship with Key, we will still apply the practices in our Policy to information we maintain on you and will honor your opt out and solicitation elections. 

**ONLINE INFORMATION PRACTICES**  
Key uses technology that encrypts (scrambles) online information so it transfers privately between you and Key's network. Your unique User ID and password help protect information online.

Key joins with certain third parties to deliver online products and services. If you ask for information through Key.com®, Key and these outside parties may keep some information you provide in order to deliver these services, such as online tools and applications, online surveys, e-mail, and cookies. Visit Key.com® for more information on how Key protects your information online.

**ADDITIONAL RIGHTS**  
You may have other privacy protections under state laws. Our information practices comply with these laws.

******YOUR OPTIONS  
****Sharing or Use of Information**  
You may restrict us from sharing or using information by opting out. The types of information and the companies we may share or use the information with are outlined in this Policy. Even if you opt out, we may still continue to share or use the information as permitted by law (as explained in the "Additional Opt Out Exceptions" section).   


If you wish to opt out, your election can apply to the following:

**CLIENT IDENTIFICATION NOTICE**  
**Information Collection Procedures for Opening Accounts**  
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each customer who opens an account. Therefore, all new and existing customers are subject to the identity verification requirements. 

When you open an account with any entity within the Key family of companies, we will ask for your name, address and identification number, and, in the case of an individual, your date of birth. For business accounts, we may also obtain this information for individuals associated with the business. We may also request to see a driver's license or other identifying documents. In all cases, Key is committed to protecting your privacy and identity.

**Certain provisions of the KeyCorp Privacy Policy are modified and superseded by the terms of this Supplemental Information for Vermont & California consumers. Please retain a copy of this Supplemental Information, together with the KeyCorp Privacy Policy, for your records. **

**Special Notice for Vermont**  
If our records indicate that you have a Vermont mailing address, the opt out procedures required to limit information sharing and use of information for marketing purposes as described in the KeyCorp Privacy Policy do not apply.

To comply with Vermont law, we will automatically opt out individuals with Vermont mailing addresses. You will continue to be opted out for as long as our records indicate you have a Vermont mailing address, or until you exercise your right to opt in. Your election to opt in will apply to all products and services you obtain within the Key family of companies for personal, family or household purposes. Unless you opt in to information sharing and/or use of information for marketing purposes, we will not disclose information about you within the Key family of companies except as permitted by law.

By law, even if you opt out, we may share information about you to jointly market our products or services with other financial institutions. The information we may share about you for joint marketing will be limited to your contact information (e.g., name, address and phone number) and information about your transactions and experiences with the Key family of companies. 

**Joint Accounts**  
If you have a product or service jointly with another person(s), we will not disclose information about the joint account pursuant to an opt in authorization, except as otherwise permitted by law, unless all joint accountholders have opted in.

**Health or Medical Information**  
Regardless of whether you have opted in, we will not share any personal health or medical information we may have without your written consent or otherwise as permitted by law. Health or medical information may include insurance application information, other health information you may provide in connection with one or more existing accounts, or information provided to us with regard to an insurance claim.

**Please note:**   
The automatic opt out of information sharing and use of information for marketing purposes we record on your behalf will continue for as long as our records indicate you are a Vermont consumer. If our records show you no longer reside in Vermont, your opt outs will revert back to the preference(s) you directly elected with Key. However, if you have not directly recorded an opt out preference with Key, and you want to continue to restrict information sharing and use of information for marketing purposes after moving outside Vermont, you must do so by calling our toll free Privacy Line at **1-800-361-0968**.
