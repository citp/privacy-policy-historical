(a) **IP Addresses (Server Log Information)**

An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the internet that allows servers to recognize your computer and lets it communicate with others. Change Healthcare collects IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, report aggregate information to affiliates, subsidiaries or partners, and to conduct site analysis. Change Healthcare will also use IP addresses to identify any users who refuse to comply with Change Healthcare's Terms of Use Agreement, and to identify users who misuse or threaten Change Healthcare’s service, site, user, clients or others.

Cookies are pieces of data that a Web site transfers to a user's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Web beacons are transparent pixel images that are used in collecting information about website usage, e-mail response and tracking.

This Site uses cookies and web beacons to provide enhanced functionality on the site (e.g., user ID and password prompts) and aggregate traffic data (e.g., what pages are the most popular). These cookies may be delivered in a first-party or third-party context. Change Healthcare may also use cookies and web beacons in association with e-mails delivered by Change Healthcare. Our Site also captures limited information (HTTP referrer, last URL requested by the user, client-side and server-side clickstream) about visits to our Site; we may use this information to analyze general traffic patterns and to perform routine system maintenance.
