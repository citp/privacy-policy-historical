2.1 Data Collection

Identifiable personal information

Chanel is likely to collect directly your identifiable personal information, namely via the “contact” section or when you subscribe to Chanel News (RSS feed).

“Identifiable personal information” refers to information related to you as an individual, communicated by you by using the application form, or that Chanel collects within the framework of your use of the Sites and which, whatever their nature, constitutes direct or indirect identifiable personal information. Identifiable personal information includes personal information (such as your first and last name, contact information, and photographs, as provided by you) as well as electronic identification data available on or from your computer (such as cookies or IP addresses). Your electronic identification data makes it possible to identify and geolocalize your Internet connection terminal and the pages you visited while using the Sites. As such, electronic identification data generally cannot be used to identify you personally.

In order to fight against counterfeiting and infringement, Chanel has set up automated processes to collect information on companies or individuals who commit or are likely to commit acts that violate its rights. This information will be accessible to any company legally authorized to use the Chanel trademarks, in France or abroad, that has been a victim of such violations, for the purpose of taking action or any necessary measures to protect their rights.
