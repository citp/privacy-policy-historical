# CHANEL POLICIES

  * ## 

CHANEL highly cares about your privacy and data protection. 

We are committed to offering the highest standards of products and services. Thus, we value each of our existing or prospective client and aim at maintaining the best protection for your personal data 

The CHANEL Online Privacy Policy explains how CHANEL collects, processes and protects your personal data when you use our website/app, when you purchase CHANEL products via our website/app, or when you apply for a job at CHANEL online as required by the data protection laws in the countries in which we do business and in particular with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation 2016/679 - “GDPR”). This Policy applies to those websites and apps which provide for a link to it. 

We have implemented a robust data protection compliance program, which includes the adoption of the high-standard data protection principles of the GDPR at a global level and includes the: 

    1. adoption of Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”), which should ensure the same level of protection by all CHANEL entities, and to allow transfers of personal data within CHANEL’s organization globally. (For the moment, our BCRs are still under consideration for approval by the data protection authorities);
    2. creation of a Data Protection Office and a network of local data protection contacts;
    3. adoption of internal policies and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations;
    4. implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to implement the data protection principles.

We may also rely on our legitimate interest in the completion of sales and in our commitment to offer you seamless after sales services and a personalized and highly qualitative treatment in the long term. 

If you are a job applicant, we process the personal data you provide us with in order to recruit for any vacancy (in the section “Careers”) and more particular in order to assess whether we shall enter into an employment contract with you based on our legitimate interest to hire the best-qualified human resources.

We welcome and value applications from talented candidates.

In case you choose not to be contacted for future opportunities, your data will be kept for up to 6 months. Where necessary, we may keep your data longer in archives in order to align with the applicable statute of limitations for claims around the recruitment process.

Cookies managed by CHANEL are stored for up to 13 months.

CHANEL respects the retention periods imposed by applicable laws and regulations. To the extent your data is no longer necessary for the provision of a service (including the after sales service referred to above) or if you no longer wish to be part of our distribution list for newsletters, beauty tips and events, your data will be deleted or archived in an anonymized or de-identified format in order to comply with applicable regulation.
