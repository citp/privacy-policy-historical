		<span class="head">Charter One Privacy Policy:</span><br><span class="head" style="font-size: 12px">Our Pledge Regarding the Responsible Use and Protection of Customer Information</span><br><br>	
	<p><i>Effective September 1, 2004</i></p>
	
	<p>At Charter One, one of our most important responsibilities to you, our customer, is the safekeeping of the 
	nonpublic personal ("confidential") information you have entrusted to us and using this information in a responsible manner. 
	Appropriate use of the confidential information you provide us is also at the heart of our ability to provide you with 
	exceptional personal service whenever you contact us.</p>
	
	<p>We are providing you with this important notice to inform you of how Charter One uses and protects your confidential 
	information. We encourage you to read and retain this notice, and to call or visit us if you have any questions. You do 
	not have to respond to this notice in any way. By maintaining a customer relationship with us, you consent to our use of 
	your confidential information in accordance with our pledge. </p>

	<p>Charter One pledge protects customers who have opened an account or obtained a financial service from us for personal, 
	family or household purposes. This pledge also applies to former customers, and to consumers who have provided 
	confidential information to us but have not entered into a customer relationship. This pledge does not apply to business 
	or commercial accounts.</p>

	<p>The following is our continuing commitment to the responsible use and protection of your confidential information—</p>
	
	<p><b>A. Collection, Use and Retention of Confidential Information</b></p>
	
	<p>We limit the collection, use and retention of confidential information to what we believe is necessary to administer 
	our business, to provide you with exceptional quality service, to comply with regulatory retention of information 
	requirements, and to make available to you other accounts, services, and opportunities that may be of benefit or interest 
	to you. For example, your information may be used to evaluate your eligibility for a loan or other service, to improve our 
	accounts and services or the way we are able to deliver them to you, or to protect you from fraud.</p>
	
	<p><b>B. Information Collection</b></p>
	
	<p>We may collect information about you from the following sources—
	</p><ul>
	<li>information we receive from you on applications, forms, or other information that you provide to us—for example, your 
	identification information, your income, where you work, the accounts you have with other financial institutions, the names 
	of your beneficiaries on your insurance policy;</li>
	<li>information we obtain at your request—for example, your fax number, or information that we need to complete a transaction 
	that you authorized;</li>
	<li>information about your transactions and experiences with us—such as account balances, the current value of your investments, 
	account usage;</li>
	<li>information we receive from external sources, including from a consumer reporting agency—such as your creditworthiness, 
	your employment verification, or your payment history; and</li>
	<li>information we receive from others, including public sources—for example, your driving history from a state registry of 
	motor vehicles for your automobile insurance, real estate records, telephone numbers.</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	
	<p><b>C. Our Protection of Confidential Information</b></p>
	
	<p>We will safeguard, according to prudent security standards, your confidential information. A fundamental element of 
	safeguarding your confidential information is to provide protection against unauthorized access or use of this information. We 
	maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal guidelines to guard your confidential 
	information against unauthorized access or use. Our employees are limited in the access they have to information about you to 
	what is reasonably necessary to complete their responsibilities, to maintain your accounts, to complete a transaction that you 
	authorized, to notify you of new products and services, or otherwise meet your needs. They are subject to a corporate code of 
	ethics and other policies that require maintaining the confidentiality of customer information.</p>
	
	<p>Charter One will continue to enhance and maintain prudent security standards and procedures to protect against unauthorized 
	access or use of your confidential information and records.  These security procedures also protect former customers and 
	consumers who have applied for an account or service at Charter One for as long as the information is retained.</p>
	
	<p>Charter One encourages you to help us protect your information and to keep your information accurate. Please do not 
	disclose your social security number, your account numbers, your access codes, or personal identification number (PIN) to your 
	accounts to anyone with whom you are not familiar or would not trust with this information. We also ask that you review your 
	statements promptly. If you suspect someone has made unauthorized transactions on your Charter One accounts, or if you believe 
	that any information about you is not accurate, please call us anytime at 
	<nobr>1-877-CHARTER</nobr> <nobr>(1-877-242-7837)</nobr>.</p>

	<p><b>D. Sharing Information within the Charter One Family of Companies</b></p>
	
	<p>We will not share any information about you within our corporate family, except as permitted by law or as expressly 
	authorized by you, and then in accordance with prudent security procedures.  Specifically, we may share with the Charter 
	One family of companies:
	</p><ul>
	<li>Information that relates to our experiences or transactions with you or your accounts, such as account balances, payment 
	history and account usage; </li>
	<li>Information that facilitates our proper identification of you when we share information about you or to protect against 
	fraud, such as your name and address; and </li>
	<li>Information we receive from you on applications and other forms or from third parties, such as your income, credit 
	references and credit history, only:
		<blockquote>
		<p>-- if the application or form discloses that we will share it, and we either give you an opportunity to tell us not 
		to share this information or you expressly authorize us to do so, or</p>
		<p>-- as otherwise permitted by applicable law (such as to make credit decisions, service your account, process 
		transactions that you request or prepare statements). </p>
		</blockquote>
	</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>

	<p>If you have given confidential medical information to us, such as for an insurance application or for other permissible 
	reasons, we will not share your confidential medical information either within or outside the Charter One family of companies 
	except in a manner disclosed to you when the information was collected, or to which you have agreed.</p>
	
	<p>Certain information, such as trust and fiduciary information, is subject to additional  limitations regarding the sharing 
	of information, both within the Charter One family of companies and externally.</p>
	
	<p><b>E. Sharing Information with Third Parties Outside the Charter One Family of Companies</b></p>
	
	<p>We will not share your confidential information with any company or third party outside the Charter One family of companies 
	except as required or permitted by law. This means, for example, that we can disclose your confidential information:
	</p><ul>
	<li>to third parties that help us provide products or services to you, such as companies that print your checks, data 
	processors that work for Charter One, mail companies, or software vendors;</li>
	<li>to third parties that assist us in marketing accounts and services;</li>
	<li>to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements to enhance our financial product or 
	service offerings;</li>
	<li>to insurance companies that underwrite insurance we arrange for our customers;</li>
	<li>to investors or other financial institutions that purchase loans from Charter One;</li>
	<li>to consumer reporting agencies;</li>
	<li>to third parties that process or service a financial product, service or transaction that you requested or authorized;</li>
	<li>to respond to a subpoena, court order or judicial process;</li>
	<li>to pursue a sale, merger, or transfer of all or a portion of a business or operating unit;</li>
	<li>to our regulators and auditors; </li>
	<li>to protect against or prevent fraud, manage risk, or resolve customer disputes; or,</li>
	<li>to a third party to whom you specifically authorize us to share the information.</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	
	<p>Whenever other companies or third parties provide services for us or on our behalf, we require them by contract to maintain 
	the appropriate safeguards to ensure the security and the confidentiality of the information that we provide them.</p>
	
	<p>Because certain disclosures of confidential information are specifically required or permitted by law, we can make these 
	disclosures even if you prefer we do not do so.  Therefore, you do not have to respond to this notice in any way.</p>
