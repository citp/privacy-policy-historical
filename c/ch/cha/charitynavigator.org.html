	<strong>CHARITY NAVIGATOR, INC. PRIVACY POLICY<br>
	Last Updated [October 5, 2012]</strong></p>
<p>
	We, at Charity Navigator, Inc. (“<u>Charity Navigator</u>,” “<u>we</u>,” “<u>us</u>,” or “<u>our</u>”), have created this privacy policy (this “<u>Privacy Policy</u>”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies to all information received by Charity Navigator, both online and offline, in any format, including electronic, paper, verbal, and through the Platform.</p>
<p>
	Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Use.<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	<strong><u>Acceptance of Terms</u></strong></p>
<p>
	By visiting the Platform and/or using our Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our accompanying Terms of Use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong><u>The Information We Collect</u></strong></p>
<p>
	Charity Navigator collects the following types of information, both directly from you and indirectly through third-party applications to which you submit information.</p>
<p>
	1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Personal Information</u></p>
<p>
	For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “<u>Personal Information</u>” means any information or set of information that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Charity Navigator to identify a natural person. &nbsp;Personal Information does not include information regarding corporate entities or information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public Personal Information.<br>
	Examples of different purposes for which we may collect Personal Information include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		In connection with the registration process for Registered Users;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
		In connection with job applications; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
		When you voluntarily submit it to us, request information about our products and services, or sign up to receive information from us, or by sending us an e-mail.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>Other Information.</u></p>
<p>
	In addition to the Personal Information, we may collect additional information on the Platform (collectively, the “<u>Other Information</u>”).&nbsp; Such Other Information may include:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>From Your Activity</u>.&nbsp; Information that we or our technology providers may automatically collect when you visit, access, and/or use the Platform, such as your IP addresses, Internet service provider, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, which sections of the Platform you visit, number of links you click while on the Platform, search terms, and operating system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>From Cookies, JavaScript Tags</u>.&nbsp; Information that we or our technology providers collect using “cookie” technology and JavaScript tags.&nbsp; Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit.&nbsp; We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to help us collect Other Information and to enhance your experience using the Platform.&nbsp; If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer.&nbsp; Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies.&nbsp; However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, the Platform may not function properly.&nbsp; We use JavaScript tags to trigger a sequence of events that includes viewing a first-party cookie (or setting that cookie if it does not already exist) and to help us tailor and optimize our Platform and provide you relevant advertisements within and outside our Platform.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>From You</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Information that you voluntarily provide to us that does not identify you personally.</p>

	<strong><u>How We Use and Share the Information</u></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We use the Personal Information and the Other Information to provide you the Services, solicit your feedback, inform you about our products and services and those of our third-party marketing partners, to administer our rewards and promotional programs, and to improve our Services to you.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
