                                    We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal
                                    information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store
                                    the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which
                                    are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information
                                    (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through
                                    the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.<br>
                                    For the confidentiality, Chat4Support will not sell, rent, swap, or otherwise disclose

                                    is not connected to the Internet.

                                    If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it
                                    is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information
                                    with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose
                                    to log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information
                                    from subsequent users.
