# Privacy Policy — Charisma Magazine

At Charisma Media, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to send you information about the latest products and services and to learn from you about new products and services that you would like us to provide. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.

### What information do we collect? How will we use it?

When you sign up for our newsletters, we need to know your e-mail address, first and last name. We gather this information only to get a better understanding of who you are and better serve you. We may use your name in order to personalize communications we have with you.

When you sign up for a web-based (online) or print subscription online, we collect your name, address, phone number, payment information and e-mail address. This is done so we can send the issues to you by mail or grant you access to our online subscriber's area. Us or our partners may also use the information collected to occasionally notify you about special promotions, events and products updates, services and special offers you may find valuable.

We do not sell your personal information to others. However, we do rent our customer list of subscribers from our print magazine versions and offer our email lists available to our partners of those subscribers who have "opt-in." We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns, and related demographic information to our partners, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.

Our site's registration, order and survey forms require users to give us contact information (like their name, email, and postal address), financial information (like their bank account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Contact information from the these forms are used to ship purchases and information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the you when necessary.

Some actions that a user may take in SCO, particularly during web publishing, may cause us to take the user through a series of steps that can be entered from a variety of locations. To make sure that we return the user to where they expect to be when they complete these steps, SCO will frequently send the user's browser a cookie to mark their current location. This sort of web server "bookmark" helps us to provide a positive, predictable user experience for more sophisticated operations. If you choose to personalize your online visit with us by providing your name and city, we set a permanent cookie to display the information each time you visit. This "cookie" can be disabled or removed within your browser settings. However, browsers that have cookies disabled will always remain at "guest" status. We also use them to deliver content specific to your interests, and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. We also use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart, and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly.

We do not use cookies for any other purpose, although this may change as we offer new features.

  2. We will NOT give the child access to unmonitored chat rooms, message boards, email accounts, or other services that would give the child the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental consent
  3. When verifiable parental consent is not obtained, we will only use the online contact information (such as email) to:
    1. Respond directly to the child's request on a one-time basis and not use that information to re-contact the child for other purposes.
    2. Request the name or online contact information of a parent for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification.
