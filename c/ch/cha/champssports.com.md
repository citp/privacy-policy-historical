Cookies  
Champs Sports does place a feature called a "cookie" on your hard drive. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie may contain certain information, such as a unique user session ID number, which is used to track the page(s) you visited. This unique number allows us to keep track of your order as you shop on our site. Cookies also allow us to recognize registered users when they visit, and to provide those customers with specific related information.  
   
If you register with us or order from our website, we use cookies to monitor and maintain information about how you use our website and what you buy. If you do not register or buy from the site, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our website in order to improve your shopping experience. Our website logs do generate certain kinds of non-identifying site usage data, such as the number of visits to our website and pages viewed. This information is used for internal purposes by technical support staff to provide better service to you.  
   
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change the configuration of your browser to prevent this from occurring. Even without a cookie, you can still take advantage of most of the features of our Website, including making a purchase, but we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user unless you log-in.

You will not be able to use [Secure Mode] if you have an older version of an Internet browser that does not support secure transactions, of if your computer is located on a local area network (LAN) that uses a firewall that prohibits secure transactions. If [Secure Mode] is not possible, please select one of our off-line options to place your order.
