Personal information is information about an identifiable individual. Publicly  available information, such as a public directory listing of your name,  address, telephone number, or electronic address, is not considered to be  personal information.</p>
<h3>COLLECTION,  USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>When you become a  customer, we ask for information such as your name, organization name, and  email address. We also collect the e-mail addresses and other personal  information provided during account registration and data integration.  Additionally we access other lists generated from advertising, email inquiries,  trade shows and conferences. Information we collect is stored on computer  servers that we use to operate the Site. These servers are located  in the U.S. Personal information of contacts  processed through and/or stored via our Site will also be held by us in  accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time-to-time, we use these lists to  promote our services. If you do not wish to receive such contact in the future,  please click the “unsubscribe” link on any promotional email you receive from  us.</p>
<p>The personal information  we collect is used to provide our products and services, for billing, for  identification and authentication, for the general operation and improvement of  our service, and to respond to inquiries, and is not used, shared with or sold  to other organizations, except: to our service providers, as required to  operate the Site and provide the products or services you've requested; to the  applicable customer of the account in respect of which contact information is  submitted to us; for collection purposes; to law enforcement agencies, in  emergencies, for internal security matters, or where required by court order or  search warrant; or when we have your permission. We do not contact our  customers' contacts except as related to operating the Site (for example: event  notifications and reminders, membership renewals, security and other  notifications).</p>
<p>We may also disclose  personal information in connection with the transfer to the acquirer upon the change  of control.</p>
<p>We may also record your  computer's IP address with your order to help us identify fraudulent credit  card use. We may share this information with the financial institution that  issued the credit card with which an order was placed or with law enforcement  authorities if we determine, or are notified, that the use of the credit card  was fraudulent.</p>
