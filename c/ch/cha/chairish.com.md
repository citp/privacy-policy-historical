## How We Share Your Information

**Personally Identifiable Information** : Chairish will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others and will not share it with others, except as follows: 

  * Chairish may disclose such information (a) if we are required to do so by law or subpoena, (b) to enforce our terms and policies; or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or safety of Chairish, our users or others. 
  * We may store information in physical locations outside the direct control of Chairish (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). 
  * Chairish may share your information with trusted third party service providers that Chairish has contracted with to provide you the Service. 
  * Chairish may share your information with trusted third party service providers that Chairish has contracted with to provide advertising services using information that our customers provide.

  * Chairish may transfer such information if Chairish is acquired as a business or its assets are sold, as is typical when a business is acquired or merged. 



## How We Protect Your Information

Chairish employs well-established security measures to safeguard our systems and your information. However, we cannot control all the individuals and activities on the internet and elsewhere, and therefore cannot guarantee that such information will never be compromised. 

## Links to External Servers and other Web Sites and Services

When you link to or interact with the External Servers, or other websites or services, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you are subject to that website's or service's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies so you understand how they treat your information. 

## Notification Procedures

It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, through posting of such notice on our web page, or by other reasonable means, as determined by Chairish in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you. 

## U.S. Based Service

Our center of operation is in the United States. Your data is held in the United States and transactions are processed in US Dollars on servers in the United States. As such, all data is held in accordance with United States laws and procedures which differ from those in other regions of the world, such as the European Union. By using this service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to these data policies. 

## Changes to Our Privacy Policy

If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page, unless we state otherwise. 

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at [support@chairish.com](mailto:support@chairish.com). 

Thank you!
