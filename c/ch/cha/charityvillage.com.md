It also explains how you can ask questions, make suggestions, and complain about our privacy practices. This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information (see below) collected by CharityVillage.

**The scope and application of the CharityVillage Privacy Policy are as follows:**

  * Employees” in this context includes past and present employees and independent contractors of CharityVillage.

  * “Non-employee Persons” in this context includes individuals who are viewers, readers, subscribers, members, advertisers, contest participants, job applicants, Internet users who are exposed to the media content of CharityVillage and about whom CharityVillage collects Personal Information, as more specifically defined below.




CharityVillage reserves the right to amend this CharityVillage Privacy Policy from time to time.

The application of the CharityVillage Privacy Policy is subject to the requirements or provisions of any applicable legislation, regulations or agreements (such as collective agreements), or the order of any court or other lawful authority.

Exclusions from privacy protection: The CharityVillage Privacy Policy does not impose any limits on the collection, use or disclosure of the following information by CharityVillage: a) information that is publicly available, such as a Person's name, address, telephone number and electronic address, when listed in a directory or made available through directory assistance; b) business-contact information, such as the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization; c) information shared publicly by a Person in their user profile, such as work or educational history, social media contacts, and other profile information; d) public information collected, used or disclosed in the course of journalistic activities; or e) aggregate information that cannot be associated with a specific person, such as demographic statistics about CharityVillage customers, or number of visitors and average time spent on a website.

## What Personal Information is collected through the Website?

There are six main classes of non-Employee Persons who may access the Website and the information we collect about each one is different:

_Visitors_ \- Visitors to the Website may visit various pages on our Website to learn more about the services we offer and explore other information we publish on our site, including newsletter, videos and webinars. We do not collect any Personal Information from visitors to the Website until they specifically decide to sign up as a user, the type of which are defined below.

_User_ _– (Webinar Attendees & eLearners)_ – As a user of Webinars you will have to provide basic contact information to register (name, postal code and email address).  As a user of our eLearner services, you will need to provide your basic contact information to use the services (name, postal code and email address) unless the purchaser of the service is an organization who registers on behalf of its employees, in which case full billing information is required.  If any of the services you wish to access are paid services, we will require your credit card details to process the payments or your contact information for invoicing depending on the purchase price.

_User_ _– (Purchasers)_ – As a purchaser of one of the products which CharityVillage offers for purchase to Visitors from time to time, including but not limited to subscriptions and the CharityVillage Salary Survey, we will require your name, email address, and credit card details to process the payments or your contact information for invoicing, depending on the purchase price.     


_User_ _\- (Job Poster)_ \- As a Job Poster you will need to supply your basic contact information when you sign up to use the service (name, email address and organization). If you subsequently decide to use any of our paid services, we will require credit card details to process the payments for these services or your contact information for invoicing, depending on the purchase price.

_User_ _\- (Job Seeker)_ \- There is no charge for Job Seekers, so we will not require any information relevant to payment such as credit card details.  However, as a job seeker you will need to supply your basic contact information when you sign up for the service (name, postal code and email address). If you subsequently either apply for a job and/or create a CV IQ profile you will be required to enter information to complete your application or profile. This information includes information typically found in a resume, such as your experience and education, as well as responses to questions asked in relation to the position you are applying for (e.g., "How many years of experience do you have in a direct sales role?"). All Job Seekers who create a CV IQ profile who are applying for a job for which the Job Poster has included as part of its application process a section called “Talent Predictor” will also need to complete our personality assessment which involves responding to between 50 and 100 questions.  These answers will be processed by a third party software partner to CharityVillage which is itself bound by the same terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.  For further information on sharing and keeping your Personal Information secure see more details described below.   

_User_ _\- (Event/Volunteer Postings & Volunteers) _– There is no charge for posting event or volunteer positions or for volunteering, so there is no payment information required.  However the Organization posting the Volunteer position or Event listing will have to submit basic contact information when you sign up to use the service (name, email address and organization) and details about the position.  As a Volunteer, you will need to supply your basic contact information when you sign up for the service (name, postal code and email address). If you subsequently apply for the volunteer position you will be required to enter information to complete your application.    

As you explore the Website, we may also collect information via frequently used information-tracking tools, such as "cookies". These cookies collect information such as your browser type, your Internet Protocol (IP) address and the actions you take on the website (i.e. pages views and links clicked).

## Purposes for Collection of Personal Information

CharityVillage has collected and collects Personal Information for the following general purposes: a) to establish and maintain responsible commercial relations with Individuals and to provide ongoing service; b) to understand Individual needs; c) to develop, enhance, market or provide products and services; d) to manage and develop its business and operations, including personnel and employment matters; and e) to meet legal or regulatory requirements, including to protect or defend a legal interest, and in connection with an actual or possible CharityVillage corporate re-organization, merger or amalgamation with another entity, or an actual or possible sale of all or a substantial portion of the assets of CharityVillage, provided that the Personal Information disclosed continues to be used by the entity acquiring the information either for evaluation of the possible transaction, or, on completion of any such transaction, for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy.

As examples of the above:

i) CharityVillage may from time to time use a Person's Personal Information to contact the Person about changes, enhancements or similar notices related to CharityVillage products and services;

ii) if a Person indicated that he/she was interested in receiving offers or information from CharityVillage or certain of our selected sponsors or advertisers, CharityVillage may send the Person materials about products and services that CharityVillage feels may be of interest to the Person; 

iii) if a Person enters a contest or other promotion offered on a CharityVillage website, CharityVillage may, under the rules of the promotion, use the Person's name and certain other information to administer the promotion, such as contacting, announcing and promoting the winners of the promotion;

iv) If a Person is a Job Poster becomes a user and wants to use our services to create a job posting CharityVillage may use the Personal Information provided by the Job Poster to create posting, process payments, communicate with Job Poster to provide CV IQ service, online assistance and troubleshooting advice and other business communications and services consistent with industry practices, our services and applicable law; and

v) if a Person is a Job Seeker and becomes a user and wants to create a CV IQ profile on our Website, CharityVillage may use the Personal Information provided by the Job Seeker to communicate with the Job Seeker, organize profile, and provide the Personal Information to the Job Poster who posted the job posting for which the Job Seeker submitted the Personal Information, and for the other purposes disclosed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. 

## How is this information used?

The information we gather through use of cookies is used only in the aggregate and not tied to personally identifiable information. For example we may track the number of visitors to a specific area of our Website or determine which of our services are used most frequently. We do this so we can continually work to improve our Website and ensure that we are providing the content and services that our visitors want to see and use.

The information we gather from users who have signed up for a Job Poster account ("Job Poster(s)") allows us to communicate with each Job Poster individually and provide them with the transactional communications necessary for their account. We may additionally use this information to send marketing or other communications unless the Job Poster has opted-out (see below).

The information we gather from users who have signed up for a job seeker account ("Job Seeker(s)") will be used to communicate with each Job Seeker individually and provide them with the transactional communications necessary for their account. We may additionally use this information to send marketing or other communications unless the job seeker has opted-out (see below).  Additionally, any information the Job Seeker has included in his or her profile or in a specific job application will be made available to the Job Poster who posted the job in order to help that Job Poster to sort and select candidates to create the best shortlist for the position they are looking to fill. If the job seeker has chosen to make their profile "open", certain aspects of it (resume, experience, education, etc.) will be visible to other Job Posters who may be looking for candidates.

## Do you share my information with anyone?

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not trade, rent, or share Personal Information with third parties. We will never sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties for their use without your consent.  As a Job Seeker who uses our services, you have given your consent to our sharing your Personal Information with the Job Poster who posted the job you are applying for as well as our third party software service provider whose severs and systems are encrypted to maintain confidentiality and security of data to industry standards and who is contractually bound to protect and maintain your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

CharityVillage also uses a third-party company to manage credit card processing. This company is not permitted to store, retain, or use billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on CharityVillage's behalf and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them.

We may also share non-personally identifying information in the aggregate with third parties, such as the media, industry observers, potential customers or partners. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, through our Website.

CharityVillage also partners with a third party software supplier that works with a scientific partner in order to perform the personality assessment offered through some of the CV IQ services. The responses to the personality assessment questions will be provided to the scientific partner in a non-identifiable format in order to permit the scoring of those responses. In other words, as a Job Seeker, none of your personally identifiable information will be provided to, or otherwise associated with your responses to the personality assessment questions provided to the external scientific partner solely for the purpose of permitting scoring of your assessment so there will be no ability for the scientific partner to identify you when scoring the personality assessment. All communications with our scientific partner will be done via a secure interface and no personal details of the Job Seeker will be transmitted with the response or the returned scores.

As mentioned, if you are a Job Seeker and have created a CV IQ profile to apply for a job posting we will share your Personal Information you have submitted to us to the Job Poster who posted the job for which you are applying.

## To whom does CharityVillage disclose Personal Information and why?

i) CharityVillage shares some of your Personal Information with third-party service providers for the purpose of delivering to you certain services if you have purchased these services from us (this does not apply to Job Seekers, Volunteer Postings or Volunteers who are not obliged to pay for these services unless they have otherwise purchased a product or service from CharityVillage which is offered for sale generally to Visitors) This may involve the delivery or actual services or use of third party platforms or technology.  We provide as much information to the third-party service providers as is necessary. We will only share Personal Information with a third-party service provider if you purchase something or register for something relating to that particular service. Any such third party service provider that we retain directly is and will continue to be contractually bound to safeguard your Personal Information, not to use it for any purpose other than the delivery of their services and to otherwise comply with all privacy laws. Use of such third party services, platforms and/or technology by you directly, through redirection from the Website or otherwise, will be subject to such third party service provider’s then current terms and conditions of use and privacy policy. For a list of third party service provider used by CharityVillage, please contact the CharityVillage privacy officer by e-mail at privacy@CharityVillage.com.

ii) If you elect to subscribe to our mailing list, we will send you updates about us, our products and other offerings and those of third party vendors that we believe may be of interest to you. You may at any time opt out from further receipt of any such e-mail communication.  Please note, however, that by unsubscribing, you will no longer receive e-mail notices of changes to our the Website’s terms and conditions of use, terms of sale and/or this privacy policy and you will therefore be required to periodically review these to ensure that no changes have been made since your last visit.

iii) CharityVillage may also disclose or share non-personally identifiable information with partners, advertisers, merchants and/or prospective merchants to help explain our business and the effectiveness of our business or for promotional purposes. For example, we may disclose aggregated demographic information which does not include any personally identifiable information.

iv) CharityVillage may transfer your Personal Information to service providers acting on its behalf in order to perform processing and other specialized services, for example, prize fulfillment of our contests, collection of overdue accounts, investigations regarding potential breaches of your obligations, product delivery, or credit card processing.

v) Your Personal Information may be processed and stored outside of the province in which you reside and/or outside of Canada by us, an affiliate or a third party service provider for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and, under the laws of these other jurisdictions, in certain circumstances foreign courts, law enforcement agencies or regulatory agencies may be entitled to access your Personal Information.

vi) CharityVillage may disclose your Personal Information to unrelated parties if we find you have violated any stated terms and conditions of use or terms of sale, or if we need to comply with applicable laws and lawful requests made by law enforcement bodies, governmental bodies or other legal and regulatory authorities.

vii) CharityVillage may disclose your Personal Information to parties connected with the contemplated or actual financing, insuring, sale, assignment or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets, including for the purposes of determining whether to proceed or continue with such transaction or business relationship or fulfilling any records or other reporting requirements to such parties. We will require such parties to treat your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to use and disclose it only for the purposes for which it was collected.

## How do you keep my information safe and secure?

We are committed to protecting the security of your Personal Information. We employ reasonable technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, employing industry-recognized technical safeguards, such as firewalls, and have adopted and implemented security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration. Notwithstanding our efforts, we cannot guarantee absolute or unqualified protection of this information given the open nature and resulting instability of the Internet and World Wide Web, and we make no representations or warranties as to the effectiveness of our security and assume no liability for security breaches due to “hackers” or any failure in the security of your computer equipment, your Internet service provider or other networks and communications providers.

CharityVillage maintains personal information in a combination of paper and electronic files. We take technical, contractual, administrative and physical security measures to protect your personal information, including:

  1. Only employees who need the information to provide services to an individual or relating to an individual are granted access to personally identifying information about such individual.
  2. We have certain secure databases where we store data. We also may store your Personal Information in paper document files in our offices. 
  3. The processes of our business include sharing your Personal Information with others to carry out our services. 
  4. Access to this information will be based on a “need to know” basis as prescribed by the requirements of their job function only. 



Not all CharityVillage interactions require that credit card information be provided. If you provide credit card information to us, we work to help protect the security of your credit card information by using industry standard secure encryption technology.

Please be aware that electronic communications through the Internet (either in terms of online forms or questionnaires or by email) are not a secure medium, and any personal information you send to us through the Internet could be intercepted or captured. If your communication is very sensitive, or includes information such as your credit card number, you should not send it electronically unless the email is encrypted, you have adequate and up-to-date security software installed, you have no reason to believe that the system that you are using has been compromised and/or your browser indicates that the access to our website is secure. Materials posted to online forums such as bulletin boards or chat rooms are public, not secure and may be viewed by anyone. Any personal information you post may be collected and used by anyone and may result in unsolicited messages from other internet users or identity theft.

## Obtaining Consent

CharityVillage will make reasonable commercial efforts to make sure Persons understand how their Personal Information will be used by CharityVillage.  CharityVillage will obtain consent from Persons before or when it collects or uses the Personal Information. CharityVillage will never attempt to deceive Persons into giving consent.

Person's consent can be express, implied, or given through an authorized representative. A Person can withdraw consent at any time, with certain exceptions noted herein. CharityVillage, however, may collect, use or disclose Personal Information without the Person's knowledge or consent in exceptional circumstances where such collection, use or disclosure is permitted or as required by law.

When you sign up as a user of the Website we explicitly ask you to confirm you agree to this Privacy Policy. Continued use of the Website constitutes on-going consent to this Privacy Policy. Additionally, we ask when you sign up whether you want to opt-in to non-transactional communications (e.g. product updates, news and marketing materials). This preference can be changed at anytime.  Also you can withdraw consent for the use of your Personal Information.  See ”Refusing or Withdrawing Consent” below.)

**Note:** If any Person at any time has any questions or concerns about CharityVillage's privacy practices, the Person can write to Customer Service - Privacy, CharityVillage Ltd., 8170 Lawson Road, Milton, Ontario, Canada, L9T 5C4 or email to [privacy@charityvillage.com](mailto:privacy@charityvillage.com). 

## Refusing or Withdrawing Consent

Subject to legal and contractual requirements, a Person can refuse to consent to CharityVillage's collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information about the Person, or a Person may withdraw the Person's consent to CharityVillage's further collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information at any time in the future by giving CharityVillage reasonable notice and sending such request to privacy@charityvillage.com, unless: i) the consent relates to certain information required for credit approval which a Person applies for or accepts, ii) the consent is otherwise required by law or iii) the use or disclosure is permitted by law or is related to the legal or regulatory requirements described herein. If a Person refuses or withdraws the Person's consent, CharityVillage may not be able to provide the Person or continue to provide the Person with some products, services or information which may be of value to the Person.

## Internet Aspects

Personal Information may be collected by CharityVillage or third-party service providers on CharityVillage's behalf. Although information collected, used or disclosed on the Internet as described below usually does not constitute Personal Information (and to the extent that such is the case, then the obligations under the CharityVillage Privacy Policy do not extend to such information), CharityVillage provides the details below about Internet aspects of CharityVillage’s services for the purposes of disclosure.

Internet Protocol Address (IP Address)

When the user's web browser requests a web page from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information. This address is called the computer's "IP address." For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time the user logs on.

CharityVillage may use the user's IP Address to:

  * Facilitate the diagnosis and remedy of a technical problem reported by the user's or CharityVillage’s technical team.

  * Display (or allow the display by Third Party advertising providers of) more appropriate and relevant content and advertising, such as content and advertising based on the user's geographic area, demographic profile and Website session behaviour.

  * Estimate user traffic from specific countries or organizations. Many IP addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers, universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.




## Cookies

A cookie is a small text file, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to the user's web browser from a website's computers and is stored on the user's computer's hard drive. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to a user's computer.

CharityVillage may use cookies to:

  * Improve the operation and performance of the CharityVillage services and to make CharityVillage services easier and more convenient to use. For example, cookies help CharityVillage provide more personalized services by recalling user preferences on subsequent visits. Cookies also allow CharityVillage to save passwords and preferences for a user so that the user will not have to re-enter them on the next visit to the CharityVillage site;

  * Measure aggregate user traffic and demographic statistics related to CharityVillage services and advertisements (e.g. number of users, average time spent, average age and similar statistics). This information helps CharityVillage to better understand when to update, change or offer new services and provides CharityVillage with details as to the performance of Third Party advertisements and content. This information may be reported, in aggregate form only, to CharityVillage’s current and prospective sponsors, advertisers and business partners. No Personal Information will be disclosed in such reports;

  * Display advertisements. CharityVillage and Third Party advertising providers may use cookies when serving advertisements on CharityVillage sites. In some cases, advertisements from Third Party advertisers are delivered to users (in conjunction with CharityVillage Services) by such Third Party advertisers, or by separately contracted advertising providers on their behalf, and not by CharityVillage; as such, the Third-party advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the CharityVillage Privacy Policy, and users should consult the privacy policies of such Third Party advertisers.

  * Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If a user prefers, the user can reset his/her browser either to notify the user when the user has received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. The user should understand that while CharityVillage does not require a user to use cookies, certain CharityVillage services will not function properly if a user sets his/her browser to not accept cookies.




## Links To Other Sites And Advertisements

A CharityVillage service may contain links to other websites and services. While CharityVillage tries to link only to sites and services that share CharityVillage’s high standards and respect for privacy, a user should understand that CharityVillage is not responsible for the content of, or the privacy practices employed by, other companies or websites. This CharityVillage Privacy Policy applies only to the CharityVillage services related to this CharityVillage Privacy Policy.

The majority of the advertisements that are displayed in connection with CharityVillage services are served through one or more reputable Third Party advertisement-serving companies that deliver the advertisements to users in conjunction with CharityVillage services.

## International Use

We are headquartered in Canada. Personal information may be accessed by us or transferred to us in Canada through use of our services or by visitors or users of the Website elsewhere in the world. By providing us with Personal Information, you consent to this transfer. We will protect the privacy and security of Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy, regardless of where it is processed or stored, however you explicitly acknowledge and consent to the fact that Personal Information stored or processed in Canada will be subject to the laws of Canada, including the ability of governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of Canada to obtain disclosure of your Personal Information.

Please note that privacy laws in some provinces are different than those in Ontario (where the Website’s registered office is based) or under federal Canadian law. Thus, Canadian individuals accessing this policy who reside in B.C., Alberta or Quebec should be advised that additional privacy practices may apply in those provinces to the provision of personal information by BC, Alberta or Quebec residents.

## Additional Information 

CharityVillage automatically collects certain information about the user's computer hardware and software. This information may include: browser type, operating system type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by CharityVillage to operate the service, to maintain the quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the CharityVillage Website.

Certain CharityVillage Services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company or Organization. If a user registers for or uses such services, both CharityVillage and the other company or organization may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.
