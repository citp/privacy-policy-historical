## Internet Aspects

Personal Information may be collected by CharityVillage Ltd. or third-party service providers on CharityVillage Ltd.'s behalf. Although information collected, used or disclosed on the Internet as described below often does not constitute Personal Information (and to the extent that such is the case, then the obligations under the CharityVillage Ltd. Privacy Policy do not extend to such information), CharityVillage Ltd. provides the details below about Internet aspects of CharityVillage Ltd.’s services for the purposes of disclosure.

### Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) 

When the user's web browser requests a web page from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information. This address is called the computer's "IP address." For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time the user logs on.

CharityVillage Ltd. may use the user's IP Address to:

  * Facilitate the diagnosis and remedy of a technical problem reported by the user's or CharityVillage Ltd.’s technical team.
  * Display (or allow the display by Third Party advertising providers of) more appropriate and relevant content and advertising, such as content and advertising based on the user's geographic area, demographic profile and site session behaviour.
  * Estimate user traffic from specific countries or organizations. Many IP addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers, universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.



### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to the user's web browser from a website's computers and is stored on the user's computer's hard drive. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to a user's computer.

CharityVillage Ltd. may use cookies to:

  * Improve the operation and performance of the CharityVillage Ltd. services and to make CharityVillage Ltd. services easier and more convenient to use. For example, cookies help CharityVillage Ltd. provide more personalized services by recalling user preferences on subsequent visits. Cookies also allow CharityVillage Ltd. to save passwords and preferences for a user so that the user will not have to re-enter them on the next visit to the CharityVillage site;


  * Measure aggregate user traffic and demographic statistics related to CharityVillage Ltd. services and advertisements (e.g. number of users, average time spent, average age and similar statistics). This information helps CharityVillage Ltd. to better understand when to update, change or offer new services and provides CharityVillage Ltd. with details as to the performance of Third Party advertisements and content. This information may be reported, in aggregate form only, to CharityVillage Ltd.’s current and prospective sponsors, advertisers and business partners. No Personal Information will be disclosed in such reports;


  * Display advertisements. CharityVillage Ltd. and Third Party advertising providers may use cookies when serving advertisements on CharityVillage Ltd. sites. In some cases, advertisements from Third Party advertisers are delivered to users (in conjunction with CharityVillage Ltd. Services) by such Third Party advertisers, or by separately contracted advertising providers on their behalf, and not by CharityVillage Ltd.; as such, the Third-party advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the CharityVillage Ltd. Privacy Policy, and users should consult the privacy policies of such Third Party advertisers.



Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If a user prefers, the user can reset his/her browser either to notify the user when the user has received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. The user should understand that while CharityVillage Ltd. does not require a user to use cookies, certain CharityVillage Ltd. services will not function properly if a user sets his/her browser to not accept cookies.

### Links To Other Sites And Advertisements

A CharityVillage Ltd. service may contain links to other websites and services. While CharityVillage Ltd. tries to link only to sites and services that share CharityVillage Ltd.’s high standards and respect for privacy, a user should understand that CharityVillage Ltd. is not responsible for the content of, or the privacy practices employed by, other companies or websites. This CharityVillage Ltd. Privacy Policy applies only to the CharityVillage Ltd. services related to this CharityVillage Ltd. Privacy Policy.

The majority of the advertisements that are displayed in connection with CharityVillage Ltd. services are served through one or more reputable Third Party advertisement-serving companies that deliver the advertisements to users in conjunction with CharityVillage Ltd. services. 

### Additional Information 

CharityVillage Ltd. automatically collects certain information about the user's computer hardware and software. This information may include: browser type, operating system type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by CharityVillage Ltd. to operate the service, to maintain the quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the CharityVillage Ltd. Site.

Certain CharityVillage Ltd. Services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company or Organization. If a user registers for or uses such services, both CharityVillage Ltd. and the other company or organization may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.
