#### **Security of your personal data**

We have implemented technology and policies with the objective of protecting your privacy from unauthorized access and improper use and will update these measures as new technology becomes available, as appropriate.

#### **Cookies policy**

We use the term “cookies” to refer to cookies and other similar technologies covered by the EU Directive on privacy in electronic communications.

**What is a cookie?**

Cookies are small data files that your browser places on your computer or device. Cookies help your browser navigate a website and the cookies themselves cannot collect any information stored on your computer or your files. When a server uses a web browser to read cookies they can help a website deliver a more user-friendly service. To protect your privacy, your browser only gives a website access to the cookies it has already sent to you.

**Why do we use cookies?**

We use cookies to learn more about the way you interact with our content and help us to improve your experience when visiting our website. Cookies remember the type of browser you use and which additional browser software you have installed. They also remember your preferences, such as language and region, which remain as your default settings when you revisit the website. Cookies also allow you to rate pages and fill in comment forms. Some of the cookies we use are session cookies and only last until you close your browser, others are persistent cookies which are stored on your computer for longer.

**How are third party cookies used?**

For some of the functions within our website we use third party suppliers, for example, when you visit a page with embedded videos or links to third party website. These videos or links (and any other content from third party suppliers) may contain third party cookies and you may wish to consult the policies of these third party website for information regarding their use of cookies.

**How do I reject and delete cookies?**

We will not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you. However, should you wish to do so, you can choose to reject or block the cookies set by us or the website of any third party suppliers by changing your browser settings – see the Help function within your browser for further details. Please note that most browsers automatically accept cookies so if you do not wish cookies to be used you may need to actively delete or block the cookies. For information on the use of cookies in mobile phone browsers and for details on how to reject or delete such cookies, please refer to your handset manual. Note, however, that if you reject the use of cookies you will still be able to visit our website but some of the functions may not work correctly.

#### **Privacy Policy for reCAPTCHA**

Invisible Captcha, or reCAPTCHA, requires end-users to click a button that says “I’m not a robot” and Google can determine whether to prompt the user with additional question (i.e. select pictures that best describe X) to verify if that person is in fact not a robot.

**How “Invisible Captcha” Works** \- reCAPTCHA collects personal information from users to make this determination of whether they’re human and not a bot.

**So, what personal information does the reCAPTCHA collect?**  
First, the reCAPTCHA algorithm will check to see if there’s any cookie placed on the computer being used.

Then, an additional reCAPTCHA-specific cookie will be added to the user’s browser, and a complete snapshot of the user’s browser window at that moment in time will be captured, pixel by pixel.

**Some of the browser and user information collected at this time includes:**  
All cookies placed over the last 6 months,  
How many mouse clicks you’ve made on that screen (or touches if on a touch device),  
The CSS information for that page,  
The date,  
The language your browser is set to,  
Any plug-ins you have installed on the browser, and  
All Javascript objects  
It’s because of this personal information collection that the requirement by CalOPPA is triggered and a Privacy Policy is required when reCAPTCHA is integrated.

#### **EU User Consent Policy**

When using our products that incorporate this policy, certain disclosures must be given to and consents obtained from end users in the European Union where EU data protection law requires such disclosures and consents.

You must use commercially reasonable efforts to disclose clearly, and obtain consent to, any data collection, sharing and usage that takes place on any site, app, email publication or other property as a consequence of your use of our products;

You must use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that an end user is provided with clear and comprehensive information about, and consents to, the storing and accessing of cookies or other information on the end user’s device where such activity occurs in connection with a product to which this policy applies.

#### **Changes to this policy**

From time to time we may make changes to this privacy policy. If we make any substantial changes to this privacy policy and the way in which we use your personal data we will post these changes on this page. Please check our privacy policy on a regular basis.
