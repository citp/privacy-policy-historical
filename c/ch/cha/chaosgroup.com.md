In addition, the collected personal data may (occasionally) be transferred to selected third parties, which may be located outside of the Economic European Area (“EEA”) in relation to the services provided to you by us or by our agents and distributors. By way of example, this may happen if any of our servers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EEA or one of our service providers is located in a country outside of the EEA. These third parties will not use your personal information for any other purposes than what we have agreed with them. We request those third parties to implement adequate levels of protection in order to safeguard your personal information.

Except as set out in this privacy policy, we will not disclose any personally identifiable information without your permission unless we are legally entitled or required to do so (for example, if required to do so by legal process or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime), or if we believe that such action is necessary to protect and/or defend our rights, property or personal safety and those of our users/customers or other individuals.
