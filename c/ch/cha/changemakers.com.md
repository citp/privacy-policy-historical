A cookie will normally contain the name of the internet domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. We use cookies to evaluate the general use of the Site. We also use cookies to identify who you are after you log in or register so that we can tailor your personal preferences for a more personalized experience. Cookies also insure that the appearance of the Site conforms to your Internet browser. You usually can configure your Internet browser to reject cookies.

We reserve the right to introduce new passive tracking technologies and techniques related to the use of the Site. In general, we do not link your identity with information that we collect passively. However, in any situation where you log in with your username and password, any or all of the information that is passively collected about your activities on the Site may be linked with your identity, and therefore may become Personal Information about you.

If you do not want us to share Personal Information with these entities, please contact us at[ connect@changemakers.com ](mailto:privacy@changemakers.net)and we will take reasonable measures to avoid sharing such information in the future.

### Use of Anonymous Information

The Site's web servers collect anonymous logs during user visits to the Site. This information is used to create aggregate statistics, for example, when the Site is accessed, the pages which refer visitors to the Site, the type of web browsers visitors use, and which pages of the Site are viewed. These statistics help us understand how the Site is used and provide us with valuable information for improving the Site in the future. From time to time, we may share such aggregate, non-personally identifiable statistical information with ­­advertisers and our partners, affiliates, consultants, suppliers, and providers. The type and amount of information we receive and store depends on how you use the Site. You can access most of our pages without telling us who you are and without revealing any Personal Information.

### Security

Changemakers tries very hard to protect our users' Personal Information. Though Changemakers strives to protect this information, no transmission of data is completely secure. Changemakers will not be liable under any circumstances for damages resulting from use of information collected from you or any other visitors to the Site. When you access your account information, we usually offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software receives encrypted information through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) of your Internet browser which encrypts the Personal Information you input before it is sent to us and seeks to prevent anyone from reading it as the information travels from your computer to ours.  
You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose Personal Information via competition entries, messages, forums, postings, or in other areas of the Site, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Changemakers.  Please do not post any Personal Information on the Site that you expect to keep private.

### Usernames and Passwords

It is your responsibility to safeguard any username or password that you have received in connection with the Site, and to notify us if you ever suspect that the security and confidentiality of such username or password has been compromised in any way. You are solely responsible for any use of the Site via your username and password.

### Links

Please note that third parties may also collect information about you, through cookies or other technologies, when you link to their websites through the Site. We do not monitor or control the information collection or privacy practices of these or any other third parties, and are not responsible for their practices or the content of their websites. If you are concerned about how third parties collect and use information, please review their privacy practices posted on their websites.

### Changes to Changemakers Privacy Policy

Our privacy practices, like the online medium itself, are subject to change. Changemakers may, in its sole discretion, change this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes in the way we collect and use Personal Information in the future. Please check this Privacy Policy frequently and particularly before you submit additional Personal Information via the Site. All revisions to this Privacy Policy will be posted on the Site via a link from the home page of the Site.
