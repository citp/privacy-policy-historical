ChannelAdvisor Corporation (" **ChannelAdvisor** ") provides technology and services that enable industry-leading companies (" **ChannelAdvisor Client(s)** ") to use online marketplaces to acquire customers (" **Buyers** ") and maximize inventory yield. ChannelAdvisor is committed to maintaining the privacy of its users, including both ChannelAdvisor Customers and Buyers. If you have accessed this Privacy Policy by clicking on the privacy policy link on a site other than the ChannelAdvisor web site, your information may be collected by ChannelAdvisor as a service to the entity that controls such other web site and the ChannelAdvisor privacy policy terms will apply to the collection of your personal information.

This Privacy Policy describes the ChannelAdvisor practices for gathering, storing, using and disseminating information. **By visiting this website you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions set forth below, please do not use or access the ChannelAdvisor services. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information as outlined below.** This policy may be changed from time to time. All changes will be posted to this site and you are encouraged to periodically check back to this site for any changes to the privacy policy.

**A. INFORMATION COLLECTION** If you are using the online marketplace services of ChannelAdvisor (the "Services"), whether through the ChannelAdvisor website or a ChannelAdvisor Client site powered by ChannelAdvisor, ChannelAdvisor may collect personal information about you including billing and shipping addresses, credit card purchasing information, product information and product order information. In addition, ChannelAdvisor may also collect information about your bidding, buying and selling history as well as third party comments regarding your bidding, buying and selling behavior. Bidding and buying history may specifically include your history with respect to any failure to complete sales on winning bids. ChannelAdvisor will collect any comments you may send to ChannelAdvisor and any information you may post to the ChannelAdvisor site or a ChannelAdvisor Client site powered by ChannelAdvisor. ChannelAdvisor may also collect information through the use of Cookies (as defined below).  
ChannelAdvisor collects personal information when you: (1) register with ChannelAdvisor, (2) become a ChannelAdvisor Client, (3) participate in an auction for a product listed by a ChannelAdvisor Client, (4) complete a checkout page for a product purchased from a ChannelAdvisor Client, (5) provide comments or submit a problem to ChannelAdvisor or a ChannelAdvisor Client, (6) request information from ChannelAdvisor and provide your name or return contact information, or (7) respond to special offers, contests or surveys. As part of the registration or checkout process, you may be asked to provide contact and billing information and other personally identifying information. Providing some of the requested information is optional and ChannelAdvisor will indicate what information is required and what information is optional.

**B. COOKIES**

ChannelAdvisor uses cookies to recognize repeat visits by users of its site and to collect information about its users' interactions with the Services.

**C. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION** 1) **Bidding and Buying Process. If you are a Buyer** and you are involved in a transaction with a ChannelAdvisor Client (for example, a seller of an item you are purchasing), we share personally identifiable information about you with that ChannelAdvisor Client in order to assist you with the bidding and buying process as well as to assist ChannelAdvisor Customers with the selling process. ChannelAdvisor will retain your information at ChannelAdvisor to support the transaction. To the extent that ChannelAdvisor Customers have access to your personally identifiable information, these entities will treat this information in no less a secure manner than they treat the personally identifiable information of customers who purchase directly through the web site of that ChannelAdvisor Client. If you are a Buyer, you are encouraged to review the privacy policies of the ChannelAdvisor Customers that provide the products or services related to your bid or purchase. You should contact ChannelAdvisor Customers directly and review their privacy policies should you have questions concerning their use of your information such as, for example, communications you may or may not wish to receive.

ChannelAdvisor may, as permitted by applicable law, disclose your personally identifiable information to ChannelAdvisor Customers, other ChannelAdvisor users or third parties in connection with an investigation of fraud, infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity and you expressly authorize ChannelAdvisor to make such disclosures.
