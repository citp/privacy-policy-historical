Here are additional details on those practices:

a.      _What Are Cookies_? We and our agents use small text files called cookies, (collectively, “Cookies”). Cookies are small pieces of data that we and our agents place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies are not themselves personally identifiable, but may be linked to personal data that you provide to us through your online interaction with us.

b.      _How We Use Cookies_.  We use Cookies so that we can improve your online experience – for example, by remembering you when you come back to visit us, and making the content you see more relevant to you. Cookies also enable us to track online purchases made through our website(s) or mobile app(s).

c.      _Your Control of Cookies_. Web browsers allow some control of most Cookies through the browser settings. To find out more about Cookies, including how to see what Cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org. Please understand, however, if you disable Cookies, some features of our Site and Services may not work as well (or at all) for you. 

d.      _Interest-Based Advertising_. We may use Cookies and other technologies, such as pixel tags, web beacons, and clear GIF files, to help manage our online advertising program. These technologies may enable us (or third party advertising services we work with) to learn which advertisements bring users to us online. They also may enable us (or third-party advertising services we work with) to track the actions of users online over time and across different web sites or platforms to measure statistics of our marketing efforts, and to deliver electronic advertisements that may be more relevant to individual consumers and that will improve the consumer experience. For information about how tracking works for online advertising purposes, and what happens when you elect a do-not-track option, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices. In addition, some third-party businesses may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology. For more information about the opt-out process, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website, available at:[ http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). At this time, our site is not able to respond to do-not-track requests from browsers.

e.      _Analytics on the Site._  We also use third-party analytics such as Google Analytics to gather and analyze _anonymous_ user information. Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"), to collect information about use of the Site and Services. Google may use cookies to collect information about your purchase history, the content you view, what websites you visit immediately prior to and after visiting the Site, and your system information and geographic information. The information generated by the Google cookies about your use of the Services will be transmitted to and stored by Google. The information collected by Google allows us to analyze the use of our Site and Services, but does not identify you.
