      </p><p align="justify" class="body"> Privacy is an important issue. We provide
        this Policy as required by law to explain our information practices. It
        applies to the Key family of companies listed at the end of this Policy.
        Please read and retain this Policy to learn how we collect and use information
        about you, and your rights to limit the sharing and use of information.</p>

      <p align="justify" class="body"> <b>How do we protect information?</b><br>
        KeyCorp ("Key") does not share customer information about you outside
        of the Key family of companies, except as permitted by law. Key has strict
        standards and procedures designed to prevent unauthorized access to information.
        We apply these standards and procedures to our facilities and online services.
        Our safeguards meet or exceed federal standards for protecting consumer
        information. We permit only authorized employees, who have been trained
        in the proper handling of information, to have access to that information.
        If an employee were to violate Key's privacy procedures, they would be
        subject to disciplinary action.<br>
      </p>

      <p align="justify" class="body"><b>What are your options?</b><br>
        Telling us not to share or use information is called "opting out". Key
        automatically opts you out of external information sharing with third
        parties outside Key. Key will not disclose information about you to third
        parties, except as permitted by law. You can also tell us not to share
        certain information within the Key family of companies, and not to use
        information for marketing purposes across the Key family of companies.
        You may also request that we not solicit you.</p>

      <p align="justify" class="body"> <b>How do you exercise your options? </b>
        <br>
        The <b>"YOUR OPTIONS"</b> section explains how to opt out of internal information
        sharing, limit internal use of information for marketing purposes, and
        restrict solicitations. </p>

      <p align="justify" class="body"> <b>What if you have already told us your
        preferences?</b><br>
        If you do not wish to change your preferences, you do not need to do anything.
        Your previously recorded opt out and solicitation elections will stay
        in effect until you change them.</p>

      <p align="justify" class="body"> <i>This Policy applies to individuals who
        inquire about and/or obtain products or services from Key for personal,
        family and household purposes. This Policy describes information practices
        across Key. However, departments and/or companies within Key may have
        more restrictive information sharing practices.</i></p>

      <p align="justify" class="body"><i>This Policy supersedes all previous notices
        or statements about practices described in this Policy. You should retain
        a copy of this Policy for your records. If Key materially changes our
        Policy, we will notify customers (who maintain an active relationship
        with Key) and prominently place a notification on our website. Active
        customers will receive an annual notification, as required by law. You
        may request a current copy of the Policy at any time by calling our toll
        free Privacy Line at 1-800-361-0968 or visiting our website at Key.com<sup><sup>®</sup></sup>.</i></p>

      <p align="justify" class="body"><b> We collect information from:</b></p>

      <ul class="body">

        </li><li>The Key family of companies on transactions you've conducted (e.g.,
          account balance, payment history and debit card usage);
        </li><li>Third parties outside Key on transactions you've conducted (e.g.,
          account balance, payment history, parties to transaction and credit
          card usage);
        </li><li>Outside sources such as brokers, dealers or schools that help us develop
          products and services (e.g., application information and transaction

          credit history and demographic information); and
        </li><li>Public sources, such as federal, state or local records (e.g., mortgage
          and lien information).
      </li></ul>

      <p align="justify" class="body"><b> SHARING AND USING INFORMATION</b><br><br>
        Key reserves the right to share and/or use all information we collect
        as this Policy describes. We do not share information about you with third
        parties outside of Key, except as permitted by law. </p>

      <p align="justify" class="body"><strong> Types of Information </strong><br>
        <b>Personal Private Information</b> - non-public personal information
        that you provide to Key (e.g., birth date, marital status, employer and
        salary) or Key obtains from a third party (e.g., credit bureau). <br>
        <b>Transaction and Experience Information</b> - information Key develops
        from our relationship with you (e.g., account number, account balances
        and payment history).<br>
        <b>Identification Information</b> - information Key obtains regarding
        your identification (e.g., name, address, telephone number and Social
        Security number). </p>

      <p align="justify" class="body"><strong> Sharing Information with Outside
        Companies (External Sharing) </strong><br>
        We do not provide information about you to third parties outside of Key,
        except as permitted by law. When Key does disclose information about you
        to third parties under the limited legal exceptions, the third parties
        are required to treat the information they receive about you in strict
        confidence; to use it only for the purpose for which it was shared; and
        not to use the information for their own marketing purposes. Key does
        not sell information about you to third parties. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="body">In addition to the "Additional Opt Out Exceptions"
        listed below, Key may from time to time share information to jointly market
        other financial institutions' products and services (e.g., mortgage bankers/brokers,
        insurance agents/companies, securities broker/dealers, indirect loan originators,
        correspondent lenders and transaction processors). </p>

      <p align="justify" class="body"> <b>Sharing Information within Key (Internal
        Sharing)</b><br>
        Key engages in several businesses (e.g., banking, mortgage lending, brokerage
        and investment services, trust administration, asset management and insurance).
        We may share Personal Private, Transaction and Experience, as well as
        Identification Information internally to prevent fraud, enhance services,
        and tailor products and services. Employees are only authorized to share
        information when a "business need to know" exists. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="body">Even if you opt out of internal information
        sharing within Key, we may share information that identifies you and share
        information on our transactions and experiences with you. </p>

      <p align="justify" class="body"> <b>Using Information within Key for Marketing
        Purposes (Marketing Use)</b><br>
        Personal Private, and Transaction and Experience Information may be used
        for marketing purposes within the Key family of companies. Information
        may be used to design and offer products or services that may benefit
        you based on your financial needs or preferences. Employees are authorized
        to access information only when a "business need to know" exists.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="body"> Even if you opt out of using information
        for marketing purposes, Key may use information for the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="body"> To market to an individual who has a pre-existing business
          relationship;
        </li><li class="body">To market to an individual who had a business relationship within
          the past 18 months; and
        </li><li class="body">To respond to an application or inquiry about a product or service.
      </li></ul>
      <p align="justify" class="body"><b> ADDITIONAL OPT OUT EXCEPTIONS</b><br>
        It is important to understand that even if you opt out, in addition to
        those exceptions listed above, Key may continue to share or use information
        about you for the following:</p>

      <ul class="body">
        <li class="body">
          <p align="justify" class="body">To perform services (e.g., check printing,
            loan servicing, printing statements, bill payment, e-mail services
            and mail house services);
        </p></li><li>
          <p align="justify" class="body">To process your account or enforce your
            agreement with us;
        </p></li><li>
          <p align="justify" class="body">To protect the rights, property or safety
            of Key, our customers or others (e.g., to protect against fraud and
            to reduce credit risk);
        </p></li><li>
          <p align="justify" class="body">To comply with a legal requirement or
            process (e.g., subpoena or court order);
        </p></li><li>
          <p align="justify" class="body">To comply with your request or authorization
            to share information; and
        </p></li><li>
          <p align="justify" class="body">To furnish information to consumer reporting
            agencies.
      </p></li></ul>

      <p align="justify" class="body"><b> FORMER CUSTOMERS </b><br>
        If you end your relationship with Key, we will still apply the practices
        in our Policy to information we maintain on you and will honor your opt
        out and solicitation elections. </p>

      <p align="justify" class="body"><b> ONLINE INFORMATION PRACTICES </b><br>
        Key uses technology that encrypts (scrambles) online information so it
        transfers privately between you and Key's network. Your unique User ID
        and password help protect information online.</p>

      <p align="justify" class="body"> Key joins with certain third parties to
        deliver online products and services. If you ask for information through
        Key.com<sup>®</sup>, Key and these outside parties may keep some information you
        provide in order to deliver these services, such as online tools and applications,
        online surveys, e-mail, and cookies. Visit Key.com<sup>®</sup> for more information
        on how Key protects your information online.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="body"> <b>ADDITIONAL RIGHTS</b><br>
        You may have other privacy protections under state laws. Our information
        practices comply with these laws.</p>

      <p align="justify" class="body"><strong> </strong><b>YOUR OPTIONS<br>
        </b><strong> Sharing or Use of Information </strong><br>
        You may restrict us from sharing or using information by opting out. The

        to share or use the information as permitted by law (as explained in the
        "Additional Opt Out Exceptions" section). <br>
      </p>

      <p align="justify" class="body"> If you wish to opt out, your election can
        apply to the following:</p>

      <ul class="body">
        <li class="body"> <strong>External Sharing</strong> - Key has automatically

        <li><b>Internal Sharing for Marketing Use</b> - limit the Personal Private,

        opt out, we still may share or use information about a joint party(ies)

        <b>Information Collection Procedures for Opening Accounts </b><br>
        To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
        activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain,
        verify, and record information that identifies each customer who opens
        an account. Therefore, all new and existing customers are subject to the
        identity verification requirements. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="body">When you open an account with any entity
        within the Key family of companies, we will ask for your name, address

        individuals associated with the business. We may also request to see a
