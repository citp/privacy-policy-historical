                            until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser).
                            We may also use tracking systems such as "Web beacons," which monitor your use of
                            our Web sites. Tracking systems (Web beacons or Web bugs) are small strings of code
                            that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a Web page for the purpose
                            of transferring data, such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer
                            that downloaded the page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource
                            Locator) of the page on which the Web beacon appears, the time the page containing
                            the Web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon and
                            the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that
                            server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, Web beacons let us
                            know whether you received and opened our e-mail.</p>
                        <p>

                            information. However, if you choose to furnish one of our Web sites with personally
                            identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the
