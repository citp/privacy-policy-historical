        We have standards and procedures to prevent unauthorized access to information.

        We train our employees on the importance of confidentiality and the proper

        You can tell us not to share certain information within the KeyCorp family

        If you wish to opt in to authorize sharing of information in addition 
        to the permitted sharing described above, your opt in authorization can 
        apply to either external information sharing or internal information sharing, 
        or both. External and internal information sharing are described below.</p>

          may elect to opt in to information sharing with nonaffiliated third 
          parties (companies that are not part of the KeyCorp family of companies), 
          in addition to those nonaffiliated third parties with which we are otherwise 
          permitted by law to share information, as described above. These additional 
          nonaffiliated third parties may offer you other financial or nonfinancial 
          products and services that could benefit you.</span></li>
        <li><span class="body"><strong>Internal Sharing - KeyCorp family of

          to the information with which we are otherwise permitted by law to share 
          with our affiliates, as described above. Sharing full information among 
          Key's family of companies increases your access to our products and 
          services, allows us to match our products and services to your specific 
          needs, as well as simplifies transaction flows.</span></li>

      <p align="justify" class="body">Your election(s) to opt in will apply to all products

        If you have a product or service jointly with another person(s), we will 
        not disclose information about the joint account pursuant to an opt in 
        authorization, except as otherwise permitted by law, unless all joint 
        accountholders have opted in. </p>

        Regardless of whether you have opted in, we will not share any personal 
        health or medical information we may have without your written consent 
        or otherwise as permitted by law. Health or medical information may include 
        insurance application information, other health information you may provide 
        in connection with one or more existing accounts, or information provided 
        to us with regard to an insurance claim.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="body"><strong>For More Information, to Opt In or to Revoke 
        a Previous Opt In</strong><br>
        If you would like more information about your options, or wish to opt 
        in to information sharing, please call our dedicated Privacy Line toll 
        free at <strong>1-800-361-0968</strong> to request a pre-printed opt in 
        form be mailed to you. If you opt in to information sharing and later 
        wish to revoke that election, you may do so at any time by calling our 
        toll free Privacy Line to change your preference.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="justify" class="body">Please note: The automatic opt out of information sharing 
        we record on your behalf to comply with Vermont state law will continue 
        for as long as our records indicate you are a Vermont resident. If our 
        records show you no longer reside in Vermont, your information sharing 
        status will revert back to the sharing preference you directly elected 
        with Key. For example, if at any time you had called Key to opt out of 
        information sharing, that preference will then be effective once the automatic 
        opt out is removed. However, if you have not directly recorded an opt 
        out preference with Key, and you want to continue to restrict information 
        sharing after moving outside Vermont, you must do so by calling our Privacy 
        Line.</p>
