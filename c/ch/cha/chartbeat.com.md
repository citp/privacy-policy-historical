##  b. Customers (those who use the Chartbeat Product) 

For Customers specifically, We collect and store Personal Data that Our Customers submit to Us, such as their names and e-mail addresses and billing information, to allow Us to identify Customers, provide the Service and notify Customers of changes or updates to the Service. 

If a Customer elects to provide it, We also collect and store the Customer's phone number, which We use to assist Us in providing the Service, including to contact them in account recovery and other scenarios. 

We also collect other information from Customers, such as IP address and browser type. We use the IP addresses of Customers to assist in login and other uses related to Customers' use of the Service. Customers' sessions on Our Site are also tracked for systems administration purposes and to track user trends. We may link IP address and other information to a Customer's account. 

We also collect Customers' user ID and password information to enable them to log into and use the Service. 

Finally, Customers are automatically opted-in to receive marketing emails from us when they register for the Service. Customers can opt-out of marketing emails by utilizing the unsubscribe links provided therein, but We may still need to send Customers e-mails relating to their accounts. 

##  c. Customer Visitors (individuals who visit publisher 's websites) 

For Customer Visitors, when a Customer Visitor visits a Customer Website, We collect certain information regarding their use of the Customer Website, such as their IP address and browser type on behalf of our Customer. Their session on the Customer Website will be tracked. We may use their IP address to identify the general geographic area from which they are accessing the Customer Website. We remove the last octet of the IP address and therefore do not store IP addresses or link IP addresses to any Personal Data. We also use this information for systems administration purposes, abuse prevention and to track user trends in connection with Our provision of the Service. 

As part of the Service, We collect information relating to traffic on the Customer Websites ("Traffic Data") on which Customers choose to activate the Service. In connection with the collection of this Traffic Data, Chartbeat does not collect any Personal Data from Customer Visitors, (i) so long as the Customer configures the Chartbeat code on the Customer Website in accordance with the instructions and documentation provided by Us, so that URLs containing Personal Data of Customer Visitors are not captured by the Service, and (ii) provided that We do collect IP addresses from Customer Visitors in order to show geolocation information but We remove the last octet of the IP address and therefore do not store IP addresses in a manner that would permit personal identification. 

Traffic Data is used to provide Customers with real-time analytics and uptime monitoring. We may aggregate and anonymize Traffic Data with that from other sites to provide benchmarking data and other functionality, but We will not use or disclose aggregated Traffic Data in a manner that reveals the identity of a Customer or Customer Website without the Customer's express prior consent. 

We also collect first party cookie IDs on behalf of Customers. Chartbeat code, by default, sets and reads a cookie on the Customer's website domain containing a randomly-generated user ID for purposes of determining unique visitor counts and visitors' loyalty to a site. Such information can be classified as Personal Data under the European General Data Protection Regulation but it is not stored in a manner that would permit personal identification. 

We also collect and use browser header information to help Us understand from which websites a Customer Visitor navigates to a Customer Website. 

Our Customers are required to: (a) make appropriate disclosures using the Customer's privacy policy or via statements on the Customer's website(s); and (b) obtain all Customer Visitors' consent to the use of cookies, if applicable, as required by law. Chartbeat is not and shall not be liable for any collection or use of Personal Data of Customer Visitors due to a Customer's placement of the Chartbeat code on the Customer Website not in accordance with Chartbeat's instructions or documentation.

##  c. Customer Website Visitors 

We are processors of information about Customer Visitors and therefore are not strictly required to provide information about the legal basis on which We use Personal Data of Customer Visitors. Accordingly, if you are a Customer Visitor, you should check the privacy policy of the website that you are visiting and that is being operated by Our Customer. Section 3 (c) above describes how we process information on behalf of Our Customers. 

If We rely on Our legitimate interests for using Personal Data, We will undertake a balancing test to ensure that Our legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the Personal Data. You can ask Us for information on this balancing test by contacting us at privacy@chartbeat.com. 

##  5\. ONWARD TRANSFER - DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES 

Except as expressly set out in this Privacy Policy, We will not sell, lease or exchange the Personal Data relating to: (i) Chartbeat Site Visitors; (ii) Our Customers; or (iii) Customer Visitors (to the extent that we obtain Personal Data), to third parties without first obtaining express consent, unless permitted or required by law.

For all types of Personal Data (from Chartbeat Site Visitors, Customers and Customer Visitors ), We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on Our behalf and may need to share Personal Data with them to provide Our products and services. Examples include billing, technical assistance, and customer service. Our agents subscribe to the same level of privacy protection as we do. Unless we tell you differently, Chartbeat's agents do not have any right to use the Personal Data we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Any agent that we share your Personal Data with must agree, via contract, to provide adequate protections for the Personal Data that are no less protective than those set out in this policy. 

##  c. Business Transfers 

Chartbeat may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, information about Customers as well as aggregated and anonymized data is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Chartbeat, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is reviewed and transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Chartbeat may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

##  d. Public authorities and compliance with law 

Chartbeat may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, prevent illegal activity, or comply with any legal obligation. 

##  e. Enforce Our Terms of Use and agreements

##  f. Protect rights and property 

We may disclose your Personal Data to protect the rights, property, or safety of Chartbeat, Our staff, Our Customers or other persons. This may include exchanging Personal Data with other organizations for the purposes of fraud protection. 

In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, Chartbeat remains potentially liable if third party processing Personal Data received from the European Union or Switzerland on its behalf processes that Personal Data in a manner which is inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles (unless Chartbeat can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage). 

##  6\. HOW LONG WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA 

We keep your Personal Data for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which the Personal Data is processed. The length of time for which We retain Personal Data depends on the purposes for which We collect and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws and to establish, exercise or defend Our legal rights. 

Except as required by applicable laws or in order to defend any actual or possible legal claims, We will take reasonable steps to return or irretrievably delete all personal data processed on behalf of Our Customers when it is no longer required to exercise or perform Our rights or obligations under Our Terms of Service, and in any event within 90 days of expiry or termination of Our Terms of Service.

##  e. For Our European Customers where the EU ePrivacy Directive applies:

    * **_cb_svref** **:** This cookie stores the original referrer for this site visitor -- for example, this will store the fact that a visitor arrived to your site via Twitter, past the first page view, so that when a visitor recirculates to a different article page, we still know that they originally arrived on your site via Twitter.

    * **_chartbeat4** **:** This is a short-lived cookie that carries leftover engagement data from one page to the next, to make sure that we can send it to our servers successfully from the next page. This ensures that we capture as much engagement data as possible. This cookie has a 1 minute duration. 
    * **_chartbeat5** **:** This is a short-lived cookie that carries click information from one page to the next. This enables us to track which links on a page were clicked on to display to editors in real-time. This cookie has a 1 minute duration.
