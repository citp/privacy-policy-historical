# Charity Navigator - Privacy

**Normal website usage:  
** Charity Navigator has a strong commitment to internet privacy. You can visit most portions of charitynavigator.org without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. The only information we collect from a normal web site visit is the name of your internet service provider, the browser and type of machine you are using, the web site that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time you request them. We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of the Charity Navigator site to our visitors.

 **Collection of personally identifiable information:**  
Charity Navigator may collect email addresses and other personally identifiable data about visitors when such data is voluntarily submitted to charitynavigator.org. For example, our site uses information collection forms for visitors to request information, sign up for the My Charities section, or to subscribe to our free newsletter. Contact information from these sign-up forms is used to send information and data about Charity Navigator to our visitors. We never request financial information from any of our visitors.

To become a registered user of the Charity Navigator site, we require registration of personal information. We use this information to make this function more effective and provide participants with additional information about charitable issues. All such information is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data.

Charity Navigator makes every effort to insure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information using industry accepted data collection and encryption methodologies.

Charity Navigator does not sell or otherwise disclose user information outside the organization.  This policy has no exceptions.  We do not sell or exchange your information with any other organization, public, private, or non-profit. 

**Cookies:  
** Like most websites, Charity Navigator may place a "cookie," or small file, in the browser files of a visitor's computer. We use cookies to save information you give us so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. This allows us to personalize the site to your taste and provide the best web experience possible to our visitors. We do not use cookies to track your movement among different web sites and do not exchange cookies with other entities.

 **Online Ad Serving**  
We use industry-standard, third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements when you visit our sites or open our emails. These companies may use cookies, pixel tags, and other methods to collect information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number)about your visits to our and other web sites to provide you with relevant advertisements about products, services, and events during your visit to our website. They can also provide us with aggregate pictures of traffic patterns, help us improve site experience, help advertisers better understand our services, and monitor advertising efforts. 

If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp) to visit the Network Advertising Initiative's website. You can also learn how to opt out of third-party advertisers' tracking methods in conjunction with links, online ads, etc. by visiting the advertisers' sites.
