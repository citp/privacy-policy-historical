# Charity Navigator - Privacy

**CHARITY NAVIGATOR, INC. PRIVACY POLICY  
Last Updated [October 5, 2012]**

We, at Charity Navigator, Inc. (“ _Charity Navigator_ ,” “ _we_ ,” “ _us_ ,” or “ _our_ ”), have created this privacy policy (this “ _Privacy Policy_ ”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared.  This Privacy Policy applies to all information received by Charity Navigator, both online and offline, in any format, including electronic, paper, verbal, and through the Platform.

Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Use.

  **_Acceptance of Terms_**

By visiting the Platform and/or using our Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our accompanying Terms of Use. 

**_The Information We Collect_**

Charity Navigator collects the following types of information, both directly from you and indirectly through third-party applications to which you submit information.

1.         _Personal Information_

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “ _Personal Information_ ” means any information or set of information that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Charity Navigator to identify a natural person.  Personal Information does not include information regarding corporate entities or information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public Personal Information.  
Examples of different purposes for which we may collect Personal Information include, but are not limited to: 

  * In connection with the registration process for Registered Users;


  * In connection with job applications; and


  * When you voluntarily submit it to us, request information about our products and services, or sign up to receive information from us, or by sending us an e-mail.



2.           _Other Information._

In addition to the Personal Information, we may collect additional information on the Platform (collectively, the “ _Other Information_ ”).  Such Other Information may include:

            a.         _From Your Activity_.  Information that we or our technology providers may automatically collect when you visit, access, and/or use the Platform, such as your IP addresses, Internet service provider, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, which sections of the Platform you visit, number of links you click while on the Platform, search terms, and operating system.   

            b.         _From Cookies, JavaScript Tags_.  Information that we or our technology providers collect using “cookie” technology and JavaScript tags.  Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit.  We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to help us collect Other Information and to enhance your experience using the Platform.  If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer.  Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies.  However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, the Platform may not function properly.  We use JavaScript tags to trigger a sequence of events that includes viewing a first-party cookie (or setting that cookie if it does not already exist) and to help us tailor and optimize our Platform and provide you relevant advertisements within and outside our Platform.

            c.         _From You_.   Information that you voluntarily provide to us that does not identify you personally.

**_The Information Collected by or Through Third-Party Advertising Companies_**  
We may share Other Information about your activity on the Platform with third parties for the purpose of tailoring, analyzing, managing, reporting, and optimizing advertising you see on the Platform and elsewhere.  These third parties may use cookies, pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs), and/or other technologies to collect such Other Information for such purposes.  Pixel tags enable us, and these third-party advertisers, to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the site on which the pixel tag is located in order to learn which advertisement brings a user to a given site.     
**_How We Use and Share the Information_**      

We use the Personal Information and the Other Information to provide you the Services, solicit your feedback, inform you about our products and services and those of our third-party marketing partners, to administer our rewards and promotional programs, and to improve our Services to you.      

We may also use and/or share the Personal Information, the Other Information, and the User Content as described below.  

  * All of your User Content on the Platform will be publicly viewable and shareable by other users both within and outside the Platform.


  * We may from time to time share Charity Representative Users’ Personal Information and Other Information with other companies who may provide such users information about the products and services they offer.  However, to the extent required by law, such users will be given the opportunity to opt-out of such sharing by contacting us as described in the “How to Contact Us” section below.


  * We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples may include providing technical assistance and customer service.  These other companies will have access to the Personal Information and the Other Information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law. 


  * In an ongoing effort to better understand visitors to our Platform and our products and services, we may analyze the Other Information in aggregate form in order to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Platform and/or our products and services.  This aggregate information does not identify individuals personally.  We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our products and services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.


  * We may share some or all of the Personal Information and Other Information with any of our parent companies, subsidiaries, or other companies under common control with us.


  * As we develop our businesses, we might sell or buy businesses or assets.  In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, sale of assets, dissolution, or similar event, the Personal Information and Other Information may be part of the transferred assets.


  * To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose the Personal Information and the Other Information: (i) when required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency; or (ii) whenever we believe that disclosing such information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Charity Navigator or others.    



**_Accessing and Modifying Information and Communication Preferences_**

Upon request, Charity Navigator will grant individuals reasonable access to Personal Information that we and our agents hold about them.  For example, visitors to the Platform who have provided Personal Information to us may review and/or make changes to the same by contacting Charity Navigator.  In addition, individuals may manage their receipt of marketing communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of any Charity Navigator marketing e-mail or by following the instructions found on the Platform.  We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely manner.  You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our subscription databases. 

**_How We Protect the Information_**

We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information and Other Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.  Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable.  We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information that you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet.  In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Platform may not be secure and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.
