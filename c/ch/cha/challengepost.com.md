##### **Children**

Devpost is not directed at children under thirteen years of age, the Site does not knowingly accept registrations from children under thirteen years of age and we do not intend to collect any personal information from children under thirteen years of age. We recommend that children under the age of thirteen ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet. If you suspect that your child under the age of thirteen has created an account on the Site and/or provided us any personal information, please let us know by e-mailing [support@devpost.com](mailto:support@devpost.com), and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

Although Devpost does not knowingly accept registrations from children under the age of thirteen through the Site and the Services, children under the age of thirteen minors can still enter and win contests by having their parents or guardians register on the Site on their behalf. In cases where a hackathon is open to children under the age of thirteen, those representing children under the age of thirteen will be required to submit a parental consent notice before their child’s submissions will be eligible to win the contest.

##### **Security**

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. Devpost takes reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in processing and the nature of such data, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. You should keep in mind, however, that no internet transmission is 100% secure or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail or other electronic means. You, too, need to strive to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer.
