You can change this information if it is displayed incorrectly. We do not share your information with Maxmind. Providing a city is required to use the service.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Your country.</td>
<td>As mentioned above, we use the IP service Maxmind to suggest your city from your IP address, in order to show you local petitions that may be of interest.

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Your unique mobile device ID number if you access our services via a mobile application.</td>
<td>When you download and use any mobile applications we develop, we’ll collect your unique device ID and all your account and activity information will be tied to that unique device ID. In addition, we may track and collect app usage data, such as the date and time the app on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the app. This information may be associated with your account.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The name of the browser you use to access Change.org.</td>
<td>Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows PC or Mac), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the Change.org platform you are using. Collecting this information helps us build and deliver the best possible version of Change.org to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Your social media account ID, and information shared with us via your social media account.</td>
<td>We may obtain certain information through your social media accounts connected to your Change.org account, if you choose to link them. Linking a social media account is not required to access the service. For example, if you log in to Change.org via Facebook, we ask for your permission to access certain information about your Facebook account, activities and friends. Social media sites make information available to all apps through their API, such as friend lists. The information we receive depends on what information you or the social media site decide to give us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Information inferred about the issues you care about based on your activities on the platform.</td>
<td>As part of our efforts to connect people to causes that interest them, petitions you sign might be tagged by our users or by us as particular cause areas. For example, a petition may be tagged as “animal rights” or “women’s rights”. If you sign one petition tagged in a particular cause area, we may infer that you would be interested in other petitions tagged in the same way. We may also send you petitions that are relevant to your general geographic area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Currently in the United States only, we use information available in public records, or other publicly available databases, such as civic data APIs which help match citizens with the elected officials who represent them at all levels in government.</td>
<td>In the United States, we receive data from the Google Civic Information API that contains lists of federal congresspeople, state legislators and governors. That data is integrated into our platform to enable users in the United States to accurately target the correct decision-maker for their petition. We also use this data to match petitions from a particular district to the right political representative. We do not share any user data with the Google Civic Information API. In future, we may carry out similar activities in other countries, subject to applicable law.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Information collected through cookies as disclosed in our linked Cookies Policy</td>
<td>We, and/or our service providers may use cookies, pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs), and other similar technologies to understand user activities.

<h3 id="3"><b>3. Who may receive your information</b></h3>
<div class="box bg-default mvs pam type-l">Here we outline who may receive your information when it is shared either by you via the platform, or by us.</div>
<h4><strong>a. The Change.org community</strong></h4>
<ul class="list-bulleted">
<li>All information you post on our platform (such as petitions you create, reasons for signing a petition, or your posts on the Change.org Community message boards) will be visible to other users. If you choose to send messages or connect with others through our platform about petitions you have signed or shared, you disclose your personal information to the recipient of your message. Our platform provides an open forum for communication by users all around the world. <b>We do not monitor, verify, or perform any background check on campaign starters, petition signers, or other users of Change.org.</b></li>
<li>Similar to traditional paper petitions, we consider an online petition to be a public expression of support for an issue. Therefore, your name, general geographic location (i.e. city, state, country), and a link to your Change.org user profile may be displayed on the landing page for any petition you sign, and on related areas of our platform. This information will be viewable to any visitor, including the media, search engines, and other organizations that provide archival internet activities.<b> If you do not wish to have your support for a petition to be public, we recommend you do not sign the petition.</b> If you do not wish to have your name displayed on a petition landing page, you may select the option not to display your name and comment publicly on the petition page.</li>
<li>Your first name, last name, city and/or postcode, and the day that you signed will be shared with the person who initiated a petition you have signed, even if you select the option not to display your name and comment publicly. This is extremely important for petition starters to demonstrate the legitimacy of their signatures to the decision-makers they are working to influence. <b>If you do not wish to have this information shared with the person who initiated the petition, please do not sign the petition.</b></li>
<li>The petition starter may choose to share your name and general geographic location with the intended decision maker who is the recipient of their petition. For example, the intended decision maker may be your congressman/woman when the petition concerns an issue relevant to him or her. If you do not wish to have this information shared with the petition recipient, you should not sign the petition.</li>
<li>If you sign a petition started by an NGO or other organization, you will be presented with the option of sharing your email address with that NGO or organization to receive direct email updates from them (not via the platform) should you choose to provide your consent for such sharing. Such organizations are not Change.org’s commercial partners and are in no way affiliated with Change.org. Enabling our users to interact directly with organizations, if those users consent to this connection, is part of our goal of helping people to stay informed on the causes that matter to them. We may revoke an organization’s access to this option in response to reports of abuse.</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>b. Your connected social media platforms</b></h4>
<ul class="list-bulleted">
<li>You may share your activities on Change.org with friends on other social media sites, for example, sharing a petition you signed on Facebook. To do so, you must connect your Change.org account with your social media account. In such case, you authorize us to share information with your social media account provider, and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy. If you do not want your information shared with other social media users or with your social media account provider, please do not connect your social media account with your Change.org account and do not use the social sharing features on the platform. For more details on how you can edit or remove the permissions you have granted to Change.org to use information from your social media accounts, please see <a href="/policies/privacy#4">Section 4c “Your Privacy choices, social media”</a>.</li>
<li>You may voluntarily share information on message boards, chats, profile pages, blogs, and other services to which you are able to post information and materials (including the Change.org pages on Facebook and other social media platforms). Please note that any information you post or disclose through these services will become public information, and may be available to other Change.org users, social media platform users and to the general public. We urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose any information about yourself via the social sharing features of our platform. For more details regarding posting content to our platform, please see our <a href="https://www.change.org/policies/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="list-bulleted">
<li>Companies within the <a href="https://help.change.org/s/article/What-are-the-Change-org-group-of-companies">Change.org group of companies</a>.

<li>Our suppliers, subcontractors and business partners (“service providers”):&nbsp;We may share information about you with our service providers who process information to provide services to us or on our behalf. We have contracts with our service providers that prohibit them from sharing the information about you that they collect or receive with anyone else or from using such information for other purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>d. Legal &amp; administrative obligations</b></h4>
<p>We may use and disclose your personal information as necessary or appropriate, especially when we have a legal obligation or legitimate interest to do so:</p>
<ul class="list-bulleted">
<li>Fraud prevention:&nbsp;We may use and disclose the information we collect from and about our users as we believe necessary to investigate, prevent, or respond to suspected illegal or fraudulent activity or to protect the safety, privacy, rights, or property of us, our users, or others.</li>
<li>Law enforcement purposes:&nbsp;If requested or required by government authorities such as law enforcement authorities, courts, regulators, or otherwise to comply with the law (which may include laws outside your country of residence), we may have to disclose information we have about our users. We also may use and disclose information collected about you in order to exercise or protect legal rights or defend against legal claims.</li>
<li>Sale or merger of our company: We have no plans to sell our business. In this unlikely event, we may use, disclose, or transfer your personal information to a third party if we or any of our company affiliates are involved in a corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets, including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</li>

<h3 id="4"><b>4. Your privacy choices</b></h3>
<div class="box bg-default mvs pam type-l">You can edit your privacy settings and the emails you receive from Change.org at any time through our “Privacy &amp; Preferences” page. If you want, you can ask us for the information we have about your account and even ask us to delete it all.</div>
<h4><b>a. Account &amp; email settings</b></h4>
<p>When you sign or create a petition via our Change.org platform, an account and user profile page are created for you. Any petitions that you sign will not appear on your user profile by default. Any petitions that you have started and published will appear on your user profile by default.

<h4><b>b. Accessing or deleting your information</b></h4>
<p>If you would like to request to review, correct, update, suppress, or delete personal information that has been previously provided to us by you, you may log in to your account, click on “Settings” and update your profile information. You can also contact our Help Center via our <a href="https://help.change.org/s/contactsupport?language=en">contact form here</a>&nbsp;and ask us to specify what personal information we have about you and to delete certain personal information about you from our records, or request to receive an electronic copy of your personal information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law). Please let us know what information you would like us to remove from our databases or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your personal information. For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the personal information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will respond to your requests consistent with applicable law, and we will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to your request. There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, but such residual information will no longer be tied to your identity. For example, if you created a petition, we will have records that other Change.org users signed your petition. If you subsequently ask us to delete your information from our platform and databases, information related to those other users’ signatures cannot be removed and will remain in our records.</p>
