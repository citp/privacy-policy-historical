<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h3>Effective Date: September  26, 2012 </h3>
<p>ChargePoint® has created this privacy policy to demonstrate its commitment  to the privacy of its customers and users. This privacy policy applies to this  website, including the portion of the website accessed by ChargePoint customers  and users (collectively, the "Web Site"), and the service offered by ChargePoint,  including through use of the ChargePoint Smart Cards (the "Service").  By using this Web Site and the Service or by transmitting information to us by  email or other electronic means, you agree to this privacy policy.</p>
<h3>1. Changes to  Privacy Policy </h3>
<p>We may change and update this privacy policy from time to time, so you  should check back to this page for the updated policy. For any significant  changes affecting your personally identifiable information, we will post a more  prominent notice to the Web Site of the change. If you disagree with any  change, you must stop using the Service. Otherwise, we will consider your  continued use to be acceptance of the change.</p>
<h3>2. Information  Collection and Usage </h3>
<p>	ChargePoint collects different kinds of information through the Web Site and  the Service, and uses this information in different ways. </p>
    <p>    Non-Personally Identifiable Information. When you visit the Web Site we  collect certain demographic information (such as your IP address, type of  Internet browser and operating system you use, pages viewed, the URL that you  visited before you came to our Web Site, and the URL to which you next go) in  order to understand how users navigate through the Web Site and to improve your  experience using the Web Site.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information. If you sign up for the Service, use the  Service, or send email or other communication to ChargePoint, we may retain  those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your  requests and improve our Web Site and Service. In registering for the Service,  we need to get some information from you (like name, title, e-mail address,  telephone number, credit card or other means of payment, etc.). When using the  Service, you may be asked for additional information to help identify you. All  of this information used to specifically identify you is called "User  Information" in this privacy policy. We only collect User Information that  you provide to us or have given us permission to collect.</p>
<p>
	When you use our Service, we collect certain demographic information (such  as your ChargePoint charging station location and charging duration) in order  to understand usage patterns and to improve your experience using our Service.	<br>
	We use the User Information in order to process the application, to provide  the Service to the customer and users and to otherwise communicate with you as  a customer or user regarding the Service. Please keep in mind that we reserve  the right to send you certain communications relating to your use of the  Service, such as service announcements, notices about new features or  information on the Service, administrative messages and communications  regarding your account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of  receiving them.</p>
<p>We also may use the User Information to provide advertisements from ChargePoint or its partners to you, but you will have the opportunity to opt-out of these  communications. From time to time, you  may receive offers through ChargePoint from other businesses. These offers may require you to provide  information to them if you choose to accept their offers. You should remember that these offers are made by the businesses themselves and not by ChargePoint. You should always be sure to read the terms  of service and privacy policies of these businesses before providing any  information to them so that you can understand their intended uses for your  information. ChargePoint may receive  information from these regarding your response to their offers so that  ChargePoint may better tailor your user experience.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may also collect information via online surveys or  polls. Participation in these surveys or polls is entirely voluntary and you  may easily decline to participate.</p>
<p> Aggregated Information. ChargePoint may also analyze and compile information  on patterns of usage of the Service. This information is collected in aggregate  form, without identifying any user individually. We may use this information to  improve the Service and provide this information to third parties for marketing  purposes.</p>
<p> Cookies. Like most websites, we also use cookies to provide users an  efficient experience in using the Web Site. A cookie is a small data file that  certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file  can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages  you have visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is  information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk  or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of the Web Site use  cookies to track user traffic patterns. ChargePoint does this in order to  determine the usefulness of the Web Site information to our users and to see  how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that  information. ChargePoint does not correlate this information with data about  individual users, nor does it share this information or sell it to any third  party.</p>
<p> Children’s Privacy. The Web Site and the Service are intended for adult  users, and ChargePoint does not knowingly collect personal information from  anyone under 13 years of age.</p>
<h3>3. Information  Sharing</h3>
<p>We generally do not share with any third party User Information in a way  that would personally identify you. However, we may do so in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul class="nobullet">
			<li>(a) as part of a merger, acquisition or any form of sale of some or all of ChargePoint  assets or business,</li>
			<li>(b) to our service providers and other contractors for the purposes of  providing Service to us (such contractors are prohibited from using User  Information for any other purpose),</li>
			<li>(c) for bill collection;</li>
			<li>(d) to resolve customer disputes or inquiries;</li>
			<li>(e) in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which  your personal information would be transferred as one of ChargePoint’s business  assets; and</li>
			<li>(f) where we are legally obligated to disclose information to the government  or third parties for the purposes of national security, law enforcement or  other issues of public importance.</li>
	</ul>
  
<p> We may aggregate information and data about you and your use of the Web Site  and Service and provide such aggregated information and data to advertisers and  for marketing or promotional purposes. In these circumstances, we do not  disclose information that could be used to personally identify you.</p>
 
<p>Access by ChargePoint, its distributors, ChargePoint charging station  owners, or authorized third parties, or their respective employees and  consultants to any personal information you provide is limited to only  information necessary to provide the business service offered and to allow  employees or consultants to perform their duties.</p>
<h3>4. Security  Measures </h3>
<p>To help protect the privacy of the data you transmit through the Web Site or  Service, ChargePoint uses industry-standard; secure server software that  encrypts the information you input before it is sent to us. In addition, ChargePoint  uses standard industry practice to protect User Information against  unauthorized access. However, you should keep in mind that the Web Site and  Service are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may  from time to time require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of  security beyond our control and for which we are not responsible.</p>
<h3>5. Links to  Third-Party Websites</h3>
<p>This Web Site may contain links to third party sites. Access to any other  Internet site linked to this Web Site is at the user’s own risk and ChargePoint  is not responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any information, data,  opinions, advice or statements made on these sites. ChargePoint provides these  links merely as a convenience and the inclusion of such links does not imply an  endorsement.</p>
<h3>6. Accessing Your  User Information</h3>
<p>We will try to update your User Information as we become aware of changes.  However, we will be able to serve you best if you update your User Information  or notify us of any changes to (or errors in) your User Information. You can  update your User Information through the Web Site or if you are unable to  access that information for any reason, you may submit a written request for  changes to Customer Service at the contact information listed below. In order  for us to serve you best, please provide your name, phone number, mailing  address, and e-mail address when contacting us.</p>
<h3>7. Consent to  Processing</h3>
<p>You expressly consent to the transfer and processing of your data (including  personally identifiable data) in the United States and in other countries.</p>
<h3>8. Governing Law</h3>
<p>The Web Site is controlled and operated by ChargePoint. By choosing to visit  our Web Site, use our Service or otherwise provide information to ChargePoint,  you agree that any dispute over privacy or the terms contained in this Privacy  Policy will be governed by the laws of the State of California. If you are  accessing our Web Site or using our Service from any location with regulations  or laws governing personal data collection, use or disclosure that differ from  United States laws or regulations, please note that through your continued use  of our Web Sites or Services, which is governed by the laws of the State of  California and the United States of America and this Privacy Policy, you are  transferring personal information to the United States of America and you  consent to that transfer and to the collection and processing of such  information in the United States. You also consent to the adjudication of any  disputes arising in connection with our Web Site or Service in the federal and  state courts of Santa Clara County in the State of California.
