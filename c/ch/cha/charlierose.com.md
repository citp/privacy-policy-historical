* ### How We Collect and Use Your Information

  * #### General

We collect personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information from you in a number of ways. “Personally identifiable information” is information that personally identifies you, such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, or credit card information (or other information that is associated by us with such above information), and non-personally identifiable information is information that does not personally identify you, including anonymous information and aggregate data. 

We use this information to understand better how our viewers use our website, research our viewers' demographics, interests, and behavior, provide visitors with customized services and information and advertising, and for other similar purposes. We may also use cookies and other technologies to learn about and remember our visitors' technology preferences and equipment (such as broadband or low bandwidth access), gain insight into and customize our visitors' use of our website, and help maintain our website's proper operation. 

We use Google Analytics, a service that uses cookies and tracking code to analyze how visitors use our website. The information collected (including your browser and operating system, IP address, pages visited on our website and time spent here) is transmitted to and stored by Google. Google uses this information to evaluate visitors' use of this website in an aggregate manner, compile reports on website activity and provide other related services. Google may transfer this information to third parties that process information on its behalf or as required by law. You can read Google's privacy policy at <http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy.html>.

In addition, we may use your personally identifiable information to contact you (or allow certain other parties to contact you) and send you information and/or marketing and promotional materials, including through postal mail, e-mail, and other means, as well as to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, and to analyze website use, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our website content, layout, and services.

You may choose to “opt out” from receiving marketing and promotional materials from us or from allowing us to share your personally identifiable information with third parties as set forth below. If you wish to so do, please click here.

  * #### Website Visits

In general, we automatically gather certain information from our website visitors, such as the number and frequency of your visits. This information may include the URL of the last and next website you visit, your browser and operating system, your IP address, how long you spend on our website and what pages you view here. We also collect information through the methods listed below. 

We and our authorized designees collect information through the servers for this website, cookies and other technologies. “Cookies” are small files placed on your hard drive; each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser preferences allow it. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although that may prevent you from using certain features on our website, and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session. In addition, a number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously. We use a “persistent” cookie to save information about your operating system and technology preferences and track website usage; in addition, if you sign up for a user account, we will save your account user id and/or e-mail address. We also use a “session cookie” to help us “remember” you until the session times out, or the closing of your browser which helps ensure that you remain logged into your account. Session cookies are automatically deleted from your hard drive after the end of a session. 

Usually, the information collected through cookies and other technologies is not personally identifiable in and of itself. However, these technological methods may enable us to collect and use information in a personally identifiable form, and we may combine data collected through cookies and other technologies with personally identifiable information; in that case, we will treat the resulting information as personal information. 

We are not responsible for any other websites accessible from or linked to this website, including their privacy policies or information collection practices. Further, we do not control any cookies, web beacons or other similar devices placed on our website by third parties, such as those that may be embedded in third-party advertising.

We may use third-party advertising networks to deliver some of the advertisements that are placed on our website. These advertising networks may use cookies, web beacons, or other technological methods to collect information about your visits to our website in order to provide you with customized advertisements.

  * #### Other Collection Method

We also collect personally identifiable information from you as follows:

User Accounts:
    If you sign up for a user account, we will collect and store certain personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, e-mail address, and interests; you may also voluntarily provide additional information such as your telephone number and postal address. This information may be visible in your profile page to other website users, depending on your privacy settings.
User Comments:
    If you participate in any public forums we may offer, such as comment sections, message boards, chat rooms, and social community environments, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you, including your name and e-mail address. Any personal information you provide when using any of these features may be visible to other users. 
E-mail Questions:
    You may choose to contact Charlie Rose Inc., by e-mail or otherwise, with other inquiries. Any personally identifiable information you provide in connection with such inquiries will be collected, accessed and used by Charlie Rose Inc. for the purpose of processing and responding to your inquiries, and to improve our website and offerings.
E-mail Updates and Other Activities:
    If you sign up on our website to receive e-mail updates, we will collect and use your e-mail address for such purposes. We will also collect personally identifiable information you voluntarily provide to us—typically, your name, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number—when you participate in other activities on our website, such as polls and informational and promotional offers.
Job Opportunities: 
    You may choose to apply for employment or an internship position with Charlie Rose Inc. through online application forms we may provide or by sending us, by e-mail or otherwise, a resume and letter (containing personally identifiable information). Any information you provide to us in this regard will be viewed by Charlie Rose Inc. only for the purpose of evaluating your application. 
Third Parties:
    We may associate other information we obtain from third parties with personally identifiable information we have collected from you. In such instances, this information will be treated in the same manner as the information we have collected directly from you. 


* ### How We Share Your Information

We may share your non-personally identifiable information with others, such as donors, sponsors, advertisers and others for informational or promotional purposes. We may share personally identifiable information with service providers, to the extent necessary for them to perform their functions for us (but not for any other purposes, such as for their own direct marketing use). Any “opt out” you choose (as discussed below) will not apply to this sharing of your information.

If Charlie Rose Inc. merges with or is acquired by another business entity, Charlie Rose Inc. has the right to share your personally identifiable information with that entity. You will receive notice of such event, and we will request that the new entity follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy or notify you of any changes to it.

We will not otherwise share your personally identifiable information other than as noted above, except as required by law, requested by governmental entity or law enforcement authority, subpoena, court order or discovery request, or when we otherwise believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate in connection with any activity that violates the law (including relating to intellectual property, fraud, contracts and privacy) or may expose us to liability. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any of your information in such circumstances. 

* ### How We Protect Your Information

The security of your information is important to us. We employ several different technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access or use. 

You should be aware, however, that “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet, and there is always the risk that unauthorized persons may access or use your personally identifiable information. You use our website and send us such information at your own risk.

* ### Your Choices About Your Information

You may choose to “opt out” from (i) receiving marketing or promotional materials from us, our affiliates or partners; and/or (ii) letting us share your personally identifiable information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Please be advised that such an opt out will not apply to our use and sharing of your personally identifiable information for non-marketing purposes, such as responding to your requests for information or services.

You may “opt out” by:

  1. checking the opt-out box when you register with us
  2. accessing your account information [here](https://web.archive.org/account/update/) and checking the opt-out box
  3. e-mailing us at [privacy@charlierose.com](mailto:privacy@charlierose.com) or writing to us at Privacy Matters, Charlie Rose Inc., 731 Lexington Avenue, New York City, NY 10022;



It may take up to 45 days for us to implement this request. Please be advised that your “opt out” request will be honored on a going-forward basis only — we cannot regain your personal information from persons who have already collected it. 

  * #### Your California Privacy Rights

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our website visitors who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please e-mail us at [privacy@charlierose.com](mailto:privacy@charlierose.com) or write to us at CA Privacy Rights, Charlie Rose Inc., 731 Lexington Avenue, New York City, NY 10022.

  * #### Our Policy Towards Children

We are concerned about the safety and privacy of children who use the Internet. Our website is not designed for or directed to children under the age of 13. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a child under 13 has somehow provided us with personally identifiable information without verifiable parental consent, we will use our best efforts to remove such information from our files. If you believe that your child has provided us with such information without your consent, please e-mail us at [privacy@charlierose.com](mailto:privacy@charlierose.com), write to us at Privacy Matters, Charlie Rose Inc., 731 Lexington Avenue, New York City, NY 10022, or call us at 212 617-1600.

  * #### Privacy Policy Changes

We may revise or supplement this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use or share your personal information, we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our website and sending you an e-mail if you have provided us with your e-mail address. 

  * #### International Use

We make no claim that our website is appropriate or lawful for use or access outside the United States. If you access this website from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk. You are solely responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations regarding online conduct and website access.

  * #### Governing Law/Forum

This Privacy Policy is governed by New York law. If we have a dispute regarding this policy or your use of our website, you agree that it shall be resolved solely in the state or federal courts located in the borough of Manhattan, New York City.
