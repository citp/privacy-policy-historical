<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p><strong> PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT ON THIS WEBSITE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE. YOU SHOULD CHECK THIS POLICY REGULARLY TO SEE IF ANY CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE. </strong></p>
<p>Chatrandom™ Privacy Policy is effective as of: 02/01/2011.</p>
<p>Your privacy is important, so ChatRandom, Inc. has created the following Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect when you visit our website, www.ChatRandom.com ("Site"), why we collect it and how it is used. This Privacy Policy explains the data collection and use practices of the Site; it does not apply to other online sites, products or services. The terms "you," "your," "yours," and "user" refer to the user or visitor using, accessing, or viewing our Site. The terms "ChatRandom," "we," "us," and "our" refer to ChatRandom, Inc.</p>
<p>By using the Site, you consent to the data collection and use practices prescribed in this Privacy Policy. We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy that we will include on this page. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy frequently and remain informed about any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often.</p>
<p>1.Personally Identifiable Information</p>
<p>"Personally Identifiable Information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, such as, without limitation, a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information, whether at work or at home. This Site may contain features that require registration. If registration is required to use this Site or portions of this Site, ChatRandom may collect Personally Identifiable Information from you when you register such as the following: first and last name, address (including zip code), email address, telephone number, authentication data, age, company, country, and such other information. ChatRandom also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your internet protocol (IP) address, cookie information and the page you request. We may collect and store Personally Identifiable Information when you register to use our Site, ask a question, complete a form, access certain areas of our site, or send us an email. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features and we may not be able to provide you with certain services.</p>
<p>We may use your Personally Identifiable Information to complete transactions, respond to your requests, answer your questions, and notify you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you. In addition, Personally Identifiable Information is used to optimize the operation of the Site, enhance our promotional and marketing activities, improve our products and services, to share with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, trouble shoot, perform administrative tasks, handle disputes, enforce our agreements, comply with laws and regulations, cooperate with law enforcement activities, and other purposes that are necessary for us to provide services you requested from us. If you use our Site or a link to our Site to send information about a product or service to another person, we may collect and store your Personally Identifiable Information, and the Personally Identifiable Information of any recipient. We may use the recipient’s Personally Identifiable Information to allow him or her to view or access the information you requested we provide.</p>
<p>For Personally Identifiable Information provided if and when applying for a job with us, we will use that information only to contact you regarding job opportunities that may be of interest. This information may also be used to contact you about announcements, administration, requests or inquires, your account, changes to our Site or policies, promotional offerings and other marketing activities, and requesting feedback through surveys and questionnaires.</p>
<p>We may from time to time send you promotional emails relating to our product, promotional, and services offerings. You are given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving promotional e-mails by simply following the "unsubscribe" instructions that appear in every email from us.</p>
<p>2.Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p>
<p>We, or our third party service providers, collect and store certain other information automatically whenever you interact with the Site. For example, we collect your internet protocol (IP) address, URL, browser information and reference site domain name every time you visit the Site. We also collect information regarding customer traffic patterns, site usage, hits to our server, Site, page views, date and time of your query, and navigational patterns. The information that is collected in this manner does not provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information about users. This non-personally identifiable information assists us in tracking the location of our users, helps determine high traffic areas and facilitates analysis of the most effective ways to communicate with our users. As part of that ongoing analysis, we may also use devices called "web beacons" to help us identify when emails sent to you have been received and read.</p>
<p>Like many web sites, we also use standard technologies such as "cookies," which are files placed on your computer’s hard drive by the sites you visit, including without limitation, local shared objects (also known as " flash cookies"). Cookies are small text files stored by your browser in your computer when you visit our Site. Websites use temporary cookies called "session" cookies to ensure that you are recognized when you move from page to page within one site and that any information you have entered is remembered. Websites also use cookies called "persistent" cookies to enable a website to remember you on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of services or functions offered. We may install both persistent and session cookies when you visit our Site. We use cookies to improve our Site and make it easier to use. Cookies permit us to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information. Most browsers will accept cookies until you change your browser settings to refuse them. If you block or refuse to accept cookies, or delete cookies after visiting our Site, you may not be able to access or use certain features or functions of our Site.</p>
<p>We may use any combination of your IP address, cookies, and other information to identify you or your computer when you visit this Site and to allow us to, in our sole discretion, immediately and without notice, block, suspend, or terminate you, temporarily or permanently, from viewing, accessing, or using this Site, or its Content and Services (a) if you have violated or breached our Terms of Use found at <a href="/terms/">http://ChatRandom.com/terms/</a>; (b) if you have violated, infringed or misappropriated ChatRandom’s or any third party’s intellectual property, proprietary, privacy, contract rights, or other rights; or (c) for any other reason or no reason. You agree that ChatRandom shall not be liable to you or any third party for any such blocking, suspension, or termination. In the event of such violation, we reserve all of our rights and remedies under this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, at law, and in equity.</p>
<p>The non-personally identifiable information we collect is also used to analyze and improve the Site and to help us provide our customers with a fulfilling and pleasant online experience. We may also use the non-personally identifiable information for trouble shooting, performing administrative tasks, managing the Site, complying with laws and regulations, and to cooperate with law enforcement activities. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze Site usage and to gather broad demographic information.</p>
<p>3.Is The Information Shared, Stored or Disclosed?</p>

<p>The records Chatrandom keeps about your chats may be shared with third parties for the purpose of law enforcement; to monitor and enforce compliance with Chatrandom's terms of service; or to improve Chatrandom's monitoring and enforcement processes.</p>
