If you like to tell a friend about the CMGG Platform, we will ask you for your name, your email address and your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him/her to visit our Website. We do not use your name, email address or your friend's email address for any other purpose. We will only use the information you provide to send the email you requested.

You also may decide to import your personal contacts (including email addresses of friend lists from third parties' websites) to our Website so that you can find your friends on the CMGG Platform, and your friends can find you on the CMGG Platform as well.

When you post any message to a forum, message board, Q&A, group, blog or any other public forum within the Website where users can post their observations and comments on designated topics, your basic information will be available for all registered users to see. This basic information consists of your username. You should not post any information about you or any other person to a forum, message board, Q&A, group, blogs or other public forums within the Website if you want to keep such information private or you are required by law to do so. Information you post to public forums within the Website is considered public information and may be used by us and third parties. As with any public forum on any website, this information may also appear in third party search engines like Google, Yahoo, MSN etc. We do not control the information indexed and cached by search engines.

When you visit the Website, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user just browsing, our servers automatically record information about your use and your visit to the Website ("Log Data"). The Log Data may include information such as your computer Internet Protocol (IP) address, time and date of your requests, your browser type, what software you were using, the web page you were visiting immediately prior to visiting the Website, access times and dates, your location, mobile network information and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze the use of the Website and for the Website's technical administration, to improve the CMGG Platform's functionalities and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to the users' needs. We only use pseudonymous data for these purposes, unless personal information is required – e.g. for the prosecution of illegal activities on our Website. In any case, we delete or anonymize personal information after a reasonable time which shall be no longer than four weeks.

Like most websites, we use cookies and web log files to track the use of the Website. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer and allows CMES to recognize you as a user when you return to the Website using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do not allow cookies, you may not be able to use the Website. Like the information you enter at registration, cookies and log file data are used to customize your experience on the Website.

One type of cookie, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you have logged in to your account. The next time you visit the CMGG Platform, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as a registered user, so you will not need to log in before using the CMGG Platform.

Additionally, if you log out of your account you will need to re-enter your password the next time in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Website. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.

Moreover, the Website may use local shared objects, commonly called a "flash cookies" for purposes such as storing users' preferences. You may manage or opt out of your flash cookies here.

In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing services to our users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any information provided to third parties through such cookies will not be personally identifiable. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by third parties, please click here. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies or you opt to refuse all cookies, you may not be able to use the Website. CMES does not store personal data in the cookies.

Furthermore, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (hereinafter referred to as "Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", small text files placed on your computer to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Due to the activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. On behalf of CMES Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website provider. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, CMES points out that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. Furthermore you can prevent Google’s collection and use of data (cookies and IP address) including its processing by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: The current link is http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de

Alternatively to using the browser plugin or in the browser on mobile devices, you may click the following link to prevent the collection by Google Analytics in the future: [download link](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

Thereby, a cookie will be placed on your device. In case you delete your cookies, you will have to click the link again.

We allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to users through our Website. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research companies.

To deliver these ads properly, we may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by CMES so the ad networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites.

Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad networks’ servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their website.

These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. CMES does not provide personal data to any advertiser or any other third parties.

CMES will communicate with you through email and notices posted on the Website or through other means available through the service, including text and other forms of messaging. If we send any communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you understand you will pay any service fees associated with any such access.

CMES takes the privacy of users very seriously. Thus, we do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personal data to third parties for marketing purposes. We will only share your personal data with third parties to carry out your instructions or to provide specific services or information. Unless you have agreed to it, these third parties do not retain, share, or store any personal data except to provide these services and they are bound by confidentiality agreements that limit their use of such information.

We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the use of the Website to third parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on the Website.

CMES cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation a court action), to protect the property and rights of CMES or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.

CMES may also disclose your personal data and other information you provide, to another third party as part of reorganization or a sale of the assets of CMES' division or company. Any third party to which we transfer or sell our assets will have the right to continue to use the personal data and other information that you provide to us.

We may share aggregated information that does not include personal data and we may otherwise disclose non-identifying information and Log Data to third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your personal data.

Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers and servers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. We will undertake in these cases to assure an adequate level of data protection of any third party receiving your personal information.

Our Website contains links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party’s link, you will be directed to those third parties' websites. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third parties' websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect personal data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal data you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies (if any) or statements of the other websites you visit.

You can review the information you provided to us and make any desired changes to them at any time by logging in to your account on the CMGG Platform. Please be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, CMES may, for a time, retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of its database. We take your rights seriously and encourage you to use them if you deem this to be appropriate. You may exercise these rights by emailing us or using the following Contact Form.

You can also delete your account. If you delete your account, we may retain certain data contributed by you if we may reasonably believe it may be necessary to prevent future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. In order to delete your account please visit "Delete Account" section associated with your account; or contact us as aforementioned.
