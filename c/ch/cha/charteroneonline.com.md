Notice of Charter One Privacy Pledge

Our Pledge to You Regarding the Responsible Use and Protection of Customer Information

Effective September 1, 2006

At Charter One, one of our most important responsibilities to you is the safekeeping of your nonpublic personal information (information). Appropriate use of the information is also at the heart of our ability to provide you with exceptional personal service whenever you contact us.

This notice tells you:

  * What information we may collect about you
  * How we protect your information and what you can do to help us protect your information
  * How we may share your information within and outside our family of companies
  * How to contact us.



We encourage you to read and retain this notice, and to call **1-800-787-0479** or visit us if you have any questions about the notice.

We protect customers who have opened an account or obtained a financial product or service from us for personal, family or household purposes. This notice also applies to former customers and to consumers who have provided information to us but have not entered into a customer relationship, for as long as information is retained. This notice does not apply to business or commercial customers.

A. Collection, Use and Retention of Your Information

We limit the collection, use and retention of your information to what we believe is necessary to provide you with exceptional quality service, comply with regulatory requirements, and make available to you other products, services, and opportunities that may be of interest to you. For example, your information may be used to evaluate your eligibility for a loan or other service, to improve our products and services or the way we deliver them to you, or to protect you from fraud.

_Our online services use features of your Internet browser called "cookies" and "flash objects". Cookies and Flash Objects are files that are placed in your computer's browser memory or placed on your hard drive. We may use these features on our web site or online banking service to verify your identity, remember personal settings including your preferences, to offer you additional options or enhance your online experience, and to improve our products and services. We also use them for marketing site personalization, and tracking of online applications and programs. Our server recognizes and records the domain name from which visitors to our site accessed the Internet and the names of the pages visited while at our site. It does not, however, collect and store your electronic mail address or other nonpublic personal information, unless you provide it to us. Finally, we also may use "cookies" to track the effectiveness of advertisements for Charter One products and services, referred to as banner ads, that we may place on Charter One and non-Charter One web sites. Cookies used for tracking advertising effectiveness do not collect nonpublic personal or confidential information._

_The Charter One web site may contain links to third party sites. These links and pointers to third party sites are not part of Charter One site. Neither Charter One nor its affiliates make any representations or warranties regarding these third party sites. Charter One is not responsible for any losses or damages in connection with the information, security, privacy practices, availability, content or accuracy of materials of such third party sites. These third party sites might have a privacy policy different from that of Charter One and third party sites may provide less security than Charter One web site. You should review their privacy and security policies, before you share any nonpublic personal information._

C. Protection of Your Information

We will safeguard your information according to prudent security standards.

We limit the access by our employees and agents to information that we believe is reasonably necessary to maintain your accounts, to complete a transaction that you authorized, or otherwise meet your needs. Our employees are subject to a corporate code of ethics and other policies that require maintaining the confidentiality of customer information.
