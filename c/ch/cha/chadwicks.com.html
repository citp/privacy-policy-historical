			Yes. It is very secure. The use of the latest cutting edge technology ensures that your shopping experience will be safe and secure. We encrypt your personal information, including your name, address, and credit card number when transmitting over the Internet using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) security software. We constantly update our security procedures and enhance our site to meet the very latest encryption standards.

			<a name="useCookies"></a>Do Chadwicks and metrostyle Use Cookies?</div>
		<div class="privacyCenterText">
			We use cookies to enhance the browsing and shopping experience on our websites. Cookies are small files or records that we place on your computers' hard drive to collect information about your activities on the sites. There are absolutely no personally identifiable pieces of information stored anywhere in these files, and they are used solely by Chadwicks and metrostyle to enhance your shopping experience and to allow us to serve you better in the future. These cookies transmit information back to the computers at Chadwicks and metrostyle; these computers are, generally speaking, the only computers which are authorized to read such information. The information captured makes it possible for us (i) to speed navigation, keep track of items in your shopping cart, and provide you with custom tailored content; (ii) to remember information you gave to us so you don't have to reenter it each time you visit the sites; (iii) to monitor the effectiveness of some of our marketing e-mail campaigns; and (iv) to monitor total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of visitors served.<br>
			<br>
			Most people do not even know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit the Chadwicks.com and metrostyle.com sites or most other websites because web browsers are typically set to accept cookies. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie acceptance altogether. However, if you refuse cookies, you will be unable to order from the Chadwicks.com and metrostyle.com sites using the Shopping Cart. You will still be able to browse our selection, but the order process requires that your Web Browser be set to allow cookies. Moreover, by not allowing cookies, your overall Internet browsing experience could be adversely affected.</div>

This information may be shared with Chadwicks and metrostyle affiliates or other outside companies. This aggregated statistical and navigational information does not include individual names, personal data or account information, so it does not identify you or any other customer.</div>
		<div class="privacyCenterText boldText">
			<a name="dataCollection"></a>What is the Policy With Respect To Data Collection From Children?</div>
		<div class="privacyCenterText">
			We take care to protect the privacy and safety of children. Our web sites are not directed or targeted to children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 on our websites. We do not permit anyone under the age of 13 to register with us. If you are under the age of 13, you are welcome to browse our websites.
