<h3>IP Addresses and Server Logs</h3>

<p>The Channel Register site does record IP addresses and produces server logs - as all Web Servers do. This information is used solely for monitoring the volume of traffic the site receives and measuring the number of readers. We do not use the information for tracking the activities of specific visitors to the site.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>The Channel Register site sets cookies in order to help with the management of its advertising.

<p>These ad servers may attempt to set cookies on your computer. All these sites stress that information gathered through these cookies is used purely for the purpose of advert delivery, recording and segmentation. They do not use information gathered through their cookies for their own use, and they do not collect any personally identifiable information.</p>
