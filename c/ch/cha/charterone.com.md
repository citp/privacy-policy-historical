**Privacy Disclosure**  
  
Charter One Bank, N.A. ("Charter One") and its affiliates* (collectively, the "Charter One Companies" and together with Charter One referred to herein as "us," "we" and "our") recognize and respect the importance of our customers' personal information. To offer you the financial products and services you seek, we collect, maintain, and use information about you on a routine basis. To help you better understand how your personal information is protected at Charter One and the Charter One Companies, we are providing you with the following statement describing our practices and policies with respect to the privacy of consumer and customer information. In the event you terminate your customer relationship with us, or become an inactive customer, we will continue to adhere to the policies and practices described in this disclosure or any future amendments to this disclosure.   
**Categories of Customer Information We Collect**  
  
We collect nonpublic personal information about you from information we receive from you on applications or other forms, from information about your transactions with us or with others, and from information we receive from consumer reporting agencies.   
**Disclosing Your Information Outside of Charter One and the Charter One Companies**  
From time to time, we will provide information about customers or former customers to other unaffiliated third party financial institutions that market our or their own financial products and services, or to others as allowed by law, except for customers who are residents of Vermont and except for Connecticut deposit and Home Equity Line of Credit customers. We may disclose all of the information we collect – as described above – to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements. For example, we may offer insurance, uninsured investment products and stock brokerage services through arrangements with unaffiliated third party financial service providers such as insurance companies, securities broker-dealers and mutual funds to enhance and expand the financial products and services available to our customers. In many cases information sharing is necessary for us to perform business functions and services, such as processing your ATM transactions or bill payments.   
**Disclosing Your Information Among Charter One and the Charter One Companies**  
Charter One and the Charter One Companies provide financial products and services to customers. By allowing us to share information about you and the products and services you obtain from us, we are better able to serve your financial needs. We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you as described above among our affiliate companies (Charter One and the Charter One Companies) that provide financial services, such as the residential mortgage lending and auto finance affiliates, the securities broker-dealer affiliate, the insurance agency affiliate, and the real estate appraisal service affiliate.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, we may share identification, transactional and experience information about you, such as your name, address, account balance and payment history, among Charter One and the Charter One Companies. You have the right to prohibit us from sharing externally gathered personal information about you with one another. Externally gathered personal information may include credit reports, information from third parties such as other creditors, financial institutions or investment companies, and such information could be obtained from applications, credit reports or other sources.

You may request (except in Vermont where your request is not necessary) that we not share among ourselves personal information about you externally gathered from third parties by contacting our toll-free customer service center at 1-877-282-0897. Your identification, transactional and experience information with us may be shared among Charter One and the Charter One Companies as allowed by applicable law.   
  
**Employee Training and Access to Your Information**  
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal guidelines to guard your nonpublic personal information. We train our employees and agents to be sensitive about confidentiality and customer privacy. We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information so that we can provide products and services to you.
