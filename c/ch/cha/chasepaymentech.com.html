<p><strong>Commitment to  Privacy and Security</strong><br>
Chase Paymentech Solutions, LLC and its operating entity Paymentech, LLC, and its affiliates, (collectively, "Chase Paymentech") are committed to safeguarding the privacy and security of the information we collect. This Privacy Statement explains the policies we follow with respect to the handling of customer information collected by Chase Paymentech.</p>

<p><strong>Information We Collect</strong><br>
Chase Paymentech's customers, the customers of its affiliates, and the customers of other third-parties for which Chase Paymentech may provide outsourced or subcontracted processing services, ("Merchants") are businesses and other legal entities desiring to accept credit or debit cards or other payment methods, as payment for goods or services. Chase Paymentech does not have direct relationships with, or collect information directly from, individual consumers other than in their capacity as owners or operators of a commercial enterprise. Chase Paymentech does not provide services for consumer, personal, family or household purposes. The information we receive and collect is strictly related to our business customers and the payment transactions that we assist them in executing, as well as from prospective or potential business customers or website visitors who may be interested in learning more about our services ("Customer Data"). The transaction information we receive from our Merchants may include personal financial information about their customers or applicants (e.g., name, address, credit or debit card account numbers 
and expiration dates, etc.) who may be individual consumers and other cardholders ("Cardholder Data"). Chase Paymentech understands that such information is sensitive and takes appropriate steps to protect the confidentiality and security of all information collected by Chase Paymentech in accordance with this Privacy 

Statement.</p>

<p><strong>Customer Data and Cardholder Data</strong><br>Use and disclosure of 

Customer Data collected by Chase Paymentech varies based on the information source 

and type, as set forth below:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Browsing the Website</strong>. When you browse Chase Paymentech's 

website, we may collect information regarding the domain and host from which you 

access the Internet, the Internet Protocol address of the computer or Internet 

Service Provider you are using, and anonymous site statistical data. In addition, we 

may collect information that you voluntarily provide us via online forms and 

questionnaires, including information you may provide about your business in order to 

apply to become a Merchant, or thereafter if you use any of our online Merchant 

services. Chase Paymentech's website is intended for commercial use only, and we 

collect, retain and use information about visitors to our websites only for specific 

business purposes, including: (i) to respond to requests for information about our 

products and services (see "Your Inquiries" below), (ii) to administer the website or 

improve site performance, (iii) to provide customer support (e.g., to allow a 

prospective Merchant to complete an online account application, to allow a Merchant 

to view and manage records, accounts and funds, or to help enhance our products and 

services); (iv) for security purposes and to combat fraud (e.g., to protect against 

unauthorized access to Chase Paymentech systems, or Merchant accounts and 

information), (v) to generate broad statistical and demographic information, and (vi) 

to comply with certain laws, regulations, and card association rules and regulations. 

In addition, when you link to Chase Paymentech's website from the website of any 

third-party advertiser, we may receive information about you from such third-party, 

including your contact information and information stored in "cookies" on such 

third-party's website. Please check the privacy policy of these websites concerning 

what information may be collected by the third-party and shared with Chase 

Paymentech. Such information is used by us only for the purposes set forth above with 

respect to information collected directly from you at our own website.</li>

<li><strong>Your Inquiries</strong>. When you complete and submit a form on our 

website, send us an e-mail, send us a fax, or contact us by telephone to solicit 

information about our services or the company in general, Chase Paymentech may store 

the inquiries and their contents. Information you submit via an inquiry is collected 

only with your knowledge and active participation, and may be used by Chase 

Paymentech to respond to your inquiries, to contact you, to inform you of services of 

Chase Paymentech or its partners that may be of use to you, and for similar business 

purposes. Information collected during the course of an inquiry will not be sold or 

otherwise disclosed to any third party; provided that such information may be shared 

internally with our affiliated entities for the business purposes set forth 

above.</li>

<li><strong>Opening an Account or Using Chase Paymentech Services</strong>. When you 

submit an application to obtain a Merchant account and become a Merchant, you will be 

required to provide us with certain information about your business, and its owners 

and officers, which may also act as guarantors of the Merchant's obligations. Chase 

Paymentech may also obtain and store information about the Merchant, and its 

officers, owners and guarantors, from consumer reporting agencies, credit bureaus, 

relevant financial institutions, and other entities. Chase Paymentech may use, retain 

and disclose this information to (i) comply with any applicable federal legislation 

requiring Chase Paymentech to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies 

each entity with which it establishes a Merchant relationship, and (ii) evaluate your 

eligibility for a Merchant account, which may involve disclosure to consumer 

reporting agencies, commercial credit bureaus, and relevant financial institutions. 

Chase Paymentech may also use your information to contact you about other Chase 

Paymentech offerings and services. If you are, or become a Merchant, Chase Paymentech 

may disclose your information during the course of providing such services to card 

associations, banks and other financial institutions that are involved in the course 

of processing or screening the transaction, and to third parties that have contracted 

with Chase Paymentech to perform certain functions of our services on our behalf. In 

addition, Chase Paymentech may use, or disclose your information to third parties for 

the additional purposes of facilitating and completing merchant-initiated or 

authorized transactions, complying with federal, state and local laws, including 

credit reporting laws and card association rules, assisting in preventing fraud, or 

informing you about general company news, product updates and developments, card 

association rules, and industry trends, offering you products and services that may 

be of interest to you, or as otherwise may be permitted or required by applicable 

law.</li>

<li><strong>Customers of Our Merchants</strong>. A customer who purchases a product 

or service from a Merchant using a credit or debit card, or any other method of 

payment for which we provide the Merchant with transaction processing services, is 

required to provide that Merchant with certain Cardholder Data in order to make the 

purchase, including the customer's name and credit card number. Our Merchants may 

transmit certain parts of this information to Chase Paymentech for the purpose of 

processing the transaction. During the course of providing processing services to our 

Merchants, we may disclose such Cardholder Data to banks, processors, credit and 

debit card organizations and associations, and other financial institutions that are 

involved in the course of effecting the transaction represented by the Cardholder 

Data. In addition, we may disclose some or all of the information we collect, to our 

affiliated companies or to non-affiliated third parties (subject to contractual 

confidentiality provisions to protect such information) such as a vendor or service 

company that we hire to prepare our Merchants' account statements or to provide 

support or services for one or more of our products. We will not disclose Cardholder 

Data to any third party, except to facilitate and complete transactions submitted to 

us by Merchants, or otherwise in the course of providing services to our Merchants, 

or to comply with federal, state and local laws or the rules and regulations of the 

respective card organizations or other payment entities (e.g. Visa, MasterCard, 

American Express, NACHA, etc.). </li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, Chase Paymentech may share certain Customer Data (but not Cardholder 

Data) with its affiliated entities for marketing purposes and other business 

purposes.</p>

administrative, technical and physical safeguards, designed to ensure the security

among others, encryption, physical access security and other appropriate 

technologies. Chase Paymentech continually reviews and enhances its security systems, 

as necessary. Chase Paymentech is subject to the detailed rules and regulations of 

the various credit and debit card organizations and networks (i.e. VISA, MasterCard,

Cardholder Data, including, but not limited to, the Payment Card Industry Data 

Security Standards ("PCI"), VISA Inc.'s Cardholder Information Security Program 

("CISP") and MasterCard International's Site Data Protection Program ("SDP"). Chase 

Paymentech endeavors to comply with all such rules at all times. Pursuant to such 

rules and regulations, Chase Paymentech is required to undergo periodic third-party 

assessments and periodic network scans to ensure that, among other things, Chase 

Paymentech has installed and maintains a firewall configuration to protect data; does 

not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters; 

protects stored data; encrypts transmission of Cardholder Data and sensitive 

information across public networks; uses and regularly updates anti-virus software; 

develops and maintains secure systems and applications; restricts access to data to 

those with a business need-to-know; tracks and monitors all access to network 

resources and Cardholder Data; regularly tests security systems and processes; 

assigns a unique ID to each person with computer access; restricts physical access to 

Cardholder Data; and maintains a policy that addresses information security. 

Additional information regarding the requirements of VISA's CISP and Mastercard's 

Site Data Protection program (SDP) can be found on the VISA, Inc. and MasterCard 

International Web sites.</p>

<p><strong>Responsibility of Merchants</strong><br>

(95/46/EC) (the "Directive").  The Directive generally restricts the transfer of 

personally identifiable information about individuals in the EU to the United States,

United States.  In addition to processing transactions for its own Merchants based in 

the United States, Chase Paymentech provides processing services in the U.S. for its 

European affiliate, Chase Paymentech Europe Limited, and its European customers. To 

address the restrictions in the Directive, Paymentech, LLC in the United States 

("CPL") adheres to the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the US 

Department of Commerce ("Safe Harbor") with respect to Cardholder Data about 

Merchants' customers in the European Union that we receive in the United States ("EU 

Cardholder Data").  We act as a data processor on behalf of Merchants with respect to 

EU Cardholder Data, and accordingly follow each Merchants' instructions with regard 

to the collection, processing and protection of EU Cardholder Data.  Our Merchants 

act as the data controller for any EU Cardholder Data.  If any consumers in the EU 

have any questions about our handling of their EU Cardholder Data, such consumers 

should first contact the Merchant as this may be the most efficient means of 

addressing such issues.  Consumers in the EU may also reach out to the CPL Safe 

Harbor Privacy Contact in the Legal Department at Chase Paymentech Solutions, 14221 

Dallas Parkway, Dallas, Texas, 75254.  Questions that are not otherwise resolved with 

the Merchant and/or CPL may also be directed to local EU data protection 

authorities.</p>

<p>Paymentech, LLC, complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
