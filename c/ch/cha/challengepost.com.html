        <p>Effective March 24, 2011</p>
<p>We at ChallengePost have created this Privacy Policy because we know you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared.  This Privacy Policy describes how we gather information from you when you visit the ChallengePost website located at www.challengepost.com and its affiliated websites (collectively referred to as the “Site”), and how we may use and share that information.  By visiting our Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Service.</p>
<p>In this Privacy Policy, the words “we,” ‘us” and “our” refer to ChallengePost.</p>
<h2>Collected Information and Use</h2>
<p>If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to ChallengePost (“Personally Identifiable Information”). Personally Identifiable Information may include your name, email address, password, and your location.  Personally Identifiable Information will not be publicly displayed on the Site unless you give us permission to display specific information (such as your full name).  Your password and email address will never be publicly displayed.</p>
<p>You may enter additional content including your username, biography, challenge ideas, wishes, photos, profile image, questions, suggestions, solutions, or other content or submissions (collectively referred to as the “User Content”). User Content may be viewable by the public.  It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not submit any User Content that you do not want publicly displayed, and that nothing you submit includes proprietary information, information that’s illegal to make public, or personal information about you such as your social security number.</p>
<p>We use the Personally Identifiable Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.  For instance, we will use the Personally Identifiable Information you input during the registration process to administer access to the Site and to award prizes by ChallengePost or the creator of the challenge.  We also use your Personally Identifiable Information and other non-personally identifiable information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site and to better understand the users of our Site.  In addition, we may use your Personally Identifiable Information to update you about the Site and the challenges we power. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.</p>
<p>ChallengePost, or a third party service provider that does not have access to your Personally Identifiable Information, may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Site. Our servers may automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a ChallengePost website. These server logs may include information such as the page(s) you visited, your Internet Protocol address, ChallengePost cookie information, web browser type, browser language, and the date and time of your request. ChallengePost uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server(s), analyze trends and administer the Site.</p>
<p>Individual challenges may require you to submit additional information and may include additional terms and conditions relating to privacy.  If there is a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the terms posted or emailed for, or applicable to, a specific challenge, the latter terms shall control with respect to that challenge only.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Like many websites, we use “cookie” technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site and our service. A cookie is a small data file that we may transfer to your computer’s hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect Personally Identifiable Information.

There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personally Identifiable Information with certain third parties including those set forth below:</p>
<h3>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties</h3>
<p>ChallengePost, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions.  For example, we may pass your Personally Identifiable Information to our designated service provider(s) in order to process payments, send mailings, and maintain databases.  When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we provide them only with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>
<h3>Advertisers</h3>
<p>ChallengePost may aggregate your information with information of other users, and disclose such information to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.  However, ChallengePost will never disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes without your express consent.</p>
