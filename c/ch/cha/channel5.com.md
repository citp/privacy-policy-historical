**Third party advertising cookies**  
Most of the advertisements you see on our sites are generated by third parties. Some of these third parties generate their own cookies to track how many people have seen a particular advertisement (or use the services of other third parties to do this), and to track how many people have seen it more than once.  These cookies cannot be used to identify an individual; they can only be used for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests.  Some of the information obtained from third party cookies will be aggregated with other anonymous information for statistical purposes.  The third party companies that generate these cookies have their own privacy policies andChannel 5 does not have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served and we have no role to play in these cookies (although we may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users of the website). 

If you would like to disable "third party" cookies generated by advertisers or providers of targeted advertising services, you can turn them off by going to the third party's website and getting them to generate a one-time "no thanks" cookie that will stop any further cookies being written to your machine.  Here are links to the main third party advertising platforms we use, each of which have instructions on how to do this:
