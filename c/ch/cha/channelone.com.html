								<p>We at ChannelOne.com care about your safety and privacy. That's why we've set up this area of our site to tell you about our Online Privacy Policy. We'll tell you what personally identifiable information of yours may be collected; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; what choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; the kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information that ChannelOne.com has about you; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. </p>
							
						
							
								<p>We hope teens, their teachers and their parents visit our site often, and share their comments and questions. </p>
							
						
							
								<p><strong>So...Who operates this site?</strong><br>
This site is operated by ChannelOne.com, a PRIMEDIA, Inc. company.  Please remember that this site and the servers that make this site available are located in the U.S.  By using this site you agree to the transfer, collection, processing and use of data by this site. </p>
							
						
							
								<p><strong>Hey Parents!</strong><br>
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and the guidelines of the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. establish special rules on the collection of personal information online from children under 13.  Parents, you can help by spending time online with your children and monitoring your children's online use. Please help us protect your child's privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this site or any other without your permission.  Please review the information below to familiarize yourself with our policies on Web site privacy.</p>
							
						
							
								<p>We do not knowingly collect and keep any personal information online from you or your child unless it is volunteered and submitted by a person 13 or older. We also do not collect and keep personal information online from children under the age of 13 without their parent's consent except in limited circumstances authorized by law and described in this policy.  We do not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in a contest, game or other activity as a condition of participation.  </p>
							
						
							
								<p><strong>What's "Personal Information" and why should I care about it?</strong><br> 
Personal Information is defined as anything that allows you to be located online or offline, like: </p>
							
						
							
								<p></p><ul>
<li> First and Last Name</li>
<li> Physical Address (street, city, state, etc.)</li>
<li> Email Address</li>
<li> Telephone Number</li>
<li> Social Security Number</li>
<li> A Persistent Identifier (like your e-mail address)</li>
<li> Information Collected Online and Combined with identifying information</li>
</ul><p></p>
							
						
							
								<p>In other words, personal information tells people how to get in touch with you-- online or offline-- and, when combined with other information (like if you're a guy or a girl, your favorite color, your favorite sport, or stuff like that), it tells someone who you are. </p>
							
						
							
								<p>Why should you care? Because you shouldn't give out personal information to just anybody! That's why we've structured our site so that most of the time, you can interact with us and with our ChannelOne.com community without being identified. And, when we do have personal information about you, we use it only to fulfill your requests. </p>
							
						
							
								<p><strong>OK. That makes sense. So what kind of personal information does ChannelOne.com collect from visitors, why do you collect it, and what do you guys do with it?</strong><br>
We collect some types of non-personal information automatically. We only collect other information if you voluntarily provide it to enter a game or contest, participate in our chat rooms or forums, or the like. </p>
							
						
							
								<p>Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our sites. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send your data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally, and we don't associate it with other personal information you may voluntarily share with us. </p>
							
						
							
								<p>We also collect limited information voluntarily supplied by visitors to answer your questions, allow you to post a comment or participate in chat or forums, and register for or enter our online games, sweepstakes and contests. </p>
							
						
							
								<p>To make use of both the comments and chat functions, users may be asked to provide certain information as part of the registration process. To post comments or participate in chat, first name, age and city or state (used only for the purpose of publishing to accompany a comment or to participate in a chat). This is not the type of information that allows you to be located online or offline. Our chat areas are really message or bulletin boards, and special rules apply. They do not take place in real time, and we always delete your information before posting anything online. Our postings are moderated and reviewed by staff prior to posting to insure that information including your full name, offline address or e-mail address has been removed. </p>
							
						
							
								<p>For online games and contests we may ask for name, email address, physical address, telephone number, age, school name and zip code, your gender, and your likes and dislikes, but only for the purpose of administering the prizes/awards. The information that we collect is for the sole purpose of administering the contest/s and awarding prizes/awards. It is available only to ChannelOne.com and those who provide services to our site or help us administer contests and sweepstakes.  To be eligible to win, however, the parents of anyone under 18 must sign an affidavit of eligibility before the prize is awarded. </p>
							
						
							
								<p>Our bottom line: we don't collect any data except to fulfill your requests and we don't sell it or share it with anybody who doesn't work for us to provide this web site service. </p>
							
						
							
								<p><strong>OK. That's simple. So what about users under 13?</strong><br> 
We do not collect personal information online from users under 13 without their parent's consent except in special, limited circumstances authorized by COPPA. </p>
							
						
							
								<p>For example, if a child under 13 sends us a request, we may use their email address to respond  but delete this information from our system after we answer the question. If we offer opportunities for a child under 13 to sign up for an e-mail newsletter or other activity which requires multiple online contact with the child, we will ask the child for a parent's e-mail address so we can notify the parent and give them an opportunity to opt the child out.  Sometimes we have special site activities or promotions, like sweepstakes or contests, which are open to children under 13.  If we need more than just  a first name or screen name and email address for you to participate, we may ask for your parent's email address so that we can notify your parents and/or get their permission for you to provide additional information we may need to administer the activity. When we ask for your parent's permission, we will tell them what information we need, what we will do with the information, and how to review your information and ask us to update or delete it.  We will delete the information you provided if we don't get your parent's permission within a reasonable time or as specified in the rules for our sweepstakes or contests.</p>
							
						
							
								<p><strong>You offer some links to other sites. What can you tell me about their privacy policies?</strong><br>
To make our site more valuable to our visitors, we offer some features in conjunction with other providers. Although we do try to link only with sites who share our philosophy regarding information collection, and who indicate they do not intend to sell or share data with third parties, we don't control the privacy policies of other sites. Once you leave our servers (you can tell where you are by checking the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information. </p>
							
						
							
								<p><strong>What security measures do you take regarding personal information?</strong><br>
Only authorized ChannelOne.com employees and consultants who work directly on the site and who agree to keep information secure can access personal information. Our servers are in a secure location. Since we only collect and retain limited personal information to begin with, and we don't sell or share it with third parties, we're confident that any information we do have is protected. </p>
							
						
							
								<p><strong>What are cookies and Web beacons, and how does ChannelOne use them?</strong><br>
Many people believe that cookies are secret tracking devices that "spy" on everything you do.  While it's true that cookies are used to identify you, they do not identify you personally.  Instead, cookies contain a random, anonymous ID number which tells our server that you've been to our site before.  Cookies are also used to "remember" whether or not you've seen certain things before, such as pop-up windows.  Once you've seen a pop-up window (such as surveys or other ChannelOne.com promotions), a cookie is placed which will prevent the box from popping up again for a certain amount of time. </p>
							
						
							
								<p>Some of our Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons, which are also called single-pixel GIFs. These images allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We also may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to count how many messages have been opened and acted upon. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information but they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our website usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. Some of our Web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by our advertising partners to help us determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.  </p>
							
						
							
								<p>Some of the banner ads displayed in our Website are provided by outside companies. These ads contain cookies and may also contain Web beacons. Unlike cookies and Web beacons used by Primedia in content it controls at its Web sites, cookies or Web beacons received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this information. We use reputable third parties to serve some or all of the advertisements that are placed within our sites and they may use information (not including personally identifiable information) about your visits to our sites and other sites to assist in serving advertisements to you. They may share anonymous information with their clients such as date/time of the banner ad shown, the specific ad shown, the IP address, etc. DoubleClick is our third party ad server.  If you would like to know more about their information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures, please see http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy.</p>
							
						
							
								<p><strong>Are there any exceptions to your privacy policy, and will you ever change your policy?</strong><br>
We may use, retain or disclose personal information if required to do so by law, to cooperate in a legal investigation, or to protect the integrity of the site. Our privacy policy will be updated to reflect changes in legislation or fair information collection standards, but we won't make any retroactive change in how we handle personal data unless required to do so by law. </p>
							
						
							
								<p><strong>What should I do if I have questions or want to update, change, or access information?</strong><br>
If you have questions regarding our privacy policy, or would like to update, access or change your information, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@primedia.com" class="color_blue"><strong>privacypolicy@primedia.com</strong></a> (be sure to include Channel One in the "Subject" line of your email), or contact us at:</p>
							
						
							
								<p>Privacy Coordinator<br>
Primedia, Inc.<br>
745 5th Ave.<br>
New York, NY  10151</p>
							
						
							
								<p>Or you can fax us at (212) 745-0131, Att: Privacy Coordinator</p>
							
						
							
								<p>If you are a parent of a child under 13, you can, with proper identification, review the personal information we have about your child, request deletion, or refuse to allow further collection or use, by writing to our Privacy Coordinator at the above address.  However, if you or your parent asks us to delete your information, we may have to ask you not to participate in our activities.  </p>
