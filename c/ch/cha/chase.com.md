**_Choice #1._ **Third party sharing: You may tell us not to share information about you with non-financial companies outside of our family of companies. Even if you do tell us not to share, we may do so as required or permitted by law. Also if you have authorized us to share information in connection with a particular product or service, we will continue to share information about you in connection with that product or service. For example, you might have a credit card with one of our airline, retail or university partners that offers rewards programs.

Even if you do tell us not to share, we may share other types of information within our family. For example, we may share name and address, information about transactions or balances with us, as well as survey results.

**_Choice #3._** Affiliate marketing. You may tell us to limit our family of companies, such as our credit card, auto finance and securities affiliates, from marketing their products and services to you if you do not have an account or business relationship with them. These marketing offers are based on your personal information that our affiliate receives from another Chase company; this information includes your income, your account history with us and your credit history with us. Your choice to limit these marketing offers will apply for five years from when you tell us your choice. After five years, you will receive a renewal notice from us that will allow you to continue to limit our affiliate marketing.
