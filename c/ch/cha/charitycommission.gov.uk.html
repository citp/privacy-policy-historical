<p class="HEADING">Disclaimer</p>
<p>
We have tried to ensure that all information we provide through this web site is correct 
at the time we included it. We apologise for any errors. We therefore do not guarantee the
 accuracy of these pages and any visitor using information contained in them does so 
entirely at their own risk. 
</p>
<br><br>
<hr width="50%" align="CENTER">
<p class="HEADING">Privacy Policy</p>
<p>


This explains how www.charitycommission.gov.uk, uses any information you give to us via 
our website, and the ways in which we protect your privacy. (NB It is not intended to be 
a privacy statement in relation to information submitted to the Commission by any other 
means.)</p>

<br><br>
<p class="HEADING2">The Data Protection Act 1998</p>
<p>

The Charity Commission is a Data Controller under the Data Protection Act 1998. We hold 
information for the purposes of maintaining the Register of Charities and certain other 
statutory functions as assigned by Parliament. The Commission complies with the data 
protection principles set out in the Data Protection Act 1998 in relation to personal data 
which you give to us via our website to the extent that the Act requires it to do so. 
These principles restrict the powers of a data controller to disclose to third parties 
personal data which it is processing.  

</p>

<br><br>
<p class="HEADING2">
What information do we collect via the website?</p>
<p>

We collect four main types of information from visitors to www.charitycommission.gov.uk: 
</p><ul>
<li> feedback (general questions and specific feedback on the website);
</li><li> notification of changes to entries on the Charity Commission’s Register of Charities;	
</li><li> representations on Schemes and Orders; and
</li><li> site usage information (from session cookies and log files).
</li></ul>

<p></p>

<br><br>
<p class="HEADING2">
1. Feedback, questions and comments</p>
<p>

You can send us your comments to our email feedback address or from our website 
questionnaire.If you send an email or letter to us or call us for information, once we have replied 
to you, we keep a record of your messages for three months for reference and audit purposes, after which it is deleted.

</p>

<br><br>
<p class="HEADING2">
2. Representations on Schemes </p>
<p>

You can make comments or representations about a scheme that the Commission is making 
for a charity by email.   A form is available for this purpose.  We must take into 
consideration any representations that we receive within the statutory period of notice. 
We may decide as a result that the proposals need to be changed.</p>

<p>We will retain a hard copy of your representation. This will be dealt with in accordance
 with the  <a href="/tcc/ccrecords.asp">Commission’s record retention policy.</a>

</p>

<br><br>
<p class="HEADING2">
3. Notification of changes to entries on the Charity Commission’s Register of Charities  </p>
<p>

Email requests to update or correct details displayed on the online Register of Charities 
are generally dealt with by our Charity Database division. The types of changes they deal
 with include changes to correspondent and website or e-mail contact details for a charity. 
The division also deals with amendment of charity financial details, area of operation, 
classifications etc.</p>

<p>Anything that could indicate a change to the operation of the charity (affecting its 
governing document, name, objects, area of benefit etc) is forwarded to our Register 
Maintenance division for them to consider.</p>

<p>All e-mails requiring our action are printed off and a hard copy is retained on the
division for internal audit purposes. These are held for 6 months and then destroyed. 
This is slightly longer than the official retention period of three months for Register
 Check forms (which updates similar details). E-mails are deleted once the item is actioned.</p>
 

<p>We will confirm that the requested changes have been made if you specifically request 
us to do so.</p>

<br><br>
