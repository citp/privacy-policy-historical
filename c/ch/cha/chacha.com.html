<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>At ChaCha we recognize that your privacy is important to you. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to your use of the ChaCha websites (the “Site”) as well as any of the services, products, software and applications offered by ChaCha (the “Services”), including our online and mobile services.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy summarizes ChaCha’s privacy practices and the uses of the information that ChaCha gathers via the Site and the Services. This Privacy Policy applies to ChaCha Search, Inc., subsidiaries and affiliates, its successors and assigns (collectively “ChaCha”). Please note that ChaCha may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and you should check this page periodically for changes. If changes are made, ChaCha will notify users by stating the date the Privacy Policy change is effective. If significant changes to the Privacy Policy are made, it will be prominently indicated on the Site.</p>
<p id="collection"><strong>The Information ChaCha Collects and Uses</strong></p>
<p>In connection with your access to or use of the Site or the Services, ChaCha may request and/or collect from you personal information that may include: first and last name, address, phone number, email address, location or other information (”Personal Information”).
