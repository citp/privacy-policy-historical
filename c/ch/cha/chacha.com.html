		   <p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>At ChaCha we recognize that your privacy is important to you. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to your use of the ChaCha websites (the “Site”) as well as any of the services, products, software and applications offered by ChaCha (the “Services”), including our online and mobile services.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy summarizes ChaCha’s privacy practices and the uses of the information that ChaCha gathers via the Site and the Services. This Privacy Policy applies to ChaCha Search, Inc., subsidiaries and affiliates, its successors and assigns (collectively “ChaCha”). Please note that ChaCha may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and you should check this page periodically for changes. If changes are made, ChaCha will notify users by stating the date the Privacy Policy change is effective. If significant changes to the Privacy Policy are made, it will be prominently indicated on the Site.</p>

<p><strong>The Information ChaCha Collects and Uses</strong></p>

<p>In connection with your access to or use of the Site or the Services, ChaCha may request and/or collect from you personal information that may include: first and last name, address, phone number, email address, location or other information (”Personal Information”). By accessing or using the Site or the Services you are accepting the terms of ChaCha’s Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Some of the Personal Information (for example your name and username) is listed publicly on chachee.heroku.com, me.chacha.com and ChaCha.me (collectively, the “ChaCha.me Service”), including on your profile page and in search results. The ChaCha.me Service is designed to help you receive answers and comments. Because most of the information you provide to the ChaCha.me Service is information you want made public, your questions and comments may be broadly and instantly disseminated. You should be careful about all information that may be made public by the ChaCha.me Service. When you submit information, you are transferring such information into the World Wide Web and you hereby consent to such transfer. Likewise, your replies to questions submitted via the ChaCha.me Service may be published to other websites. You are responsible for what gets published. Whatever you enter into the ChaCha.me Service text boxes may be published and could be publicly viewable immediately upon your clicking the submit button.</p>
