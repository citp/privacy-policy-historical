# Privacy Policy - Chocolate & Zucchini

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Chocolate & Zucchini collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a “User”) of the website (“Site”). This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered by Chocolate & Zucchini.

## Personal identification information

We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when users subscribe to the newsletter, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Site (such as comments and giveaways). Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address, mailing address, phone number, age, and gender. Users may, however, visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personally identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site-related activities.

Each user’s IP address is logged with each visit and each action performed on the Site. This information is never provided to the third parties, except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, and is logged only for a temporary period of time. IP address information is linked to personal information and may be used in an effort to block a “banned” user from accessing the Site.

Except as noted herein, we do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information.
