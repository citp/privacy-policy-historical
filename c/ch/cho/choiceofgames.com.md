# Privacy Policy | Choice of Games

[Home](http://www.choiceofgames.com/)

Choice of Games is committed to protecting your privacy while providing a high-quality experience. This policy details our commitment to you. 

Our games set cookies in your browser and access the information stored in those cookies. We use this information to keep track of game statusâ€”to provide save game functionality. We never access cookies set by other websites or information other than your responses to our games. 

We may record your responses to questions in games so that we can improve our games in the future. In no case will we record individually identifiable information about your choices in games. 

We gather some automatic information such as your IP address and referring site. We use Google Analytics, which records some personal data including IP, cookies, browser and system information, and physical location. We do not have access to and do not seek to have access to any individualized data from Google Analytics. We use this information for aggregate trends analysis without any access to individualized information. We also work with advertising networks to provide ads. To make the ads as useful as possible, our advertising providers may access information about your IP address or physical location. 

If you post comments on our blog or send us e-mail, we may keep your e-mail address. We use e-mail addresses solely to send messages directly responsive to your contactsâ€”answering questions, replying to comments, and the like. In some cases, we may ask you for permission to put you on a mailing list to be contacted about important news. We never place e-mail addresses on our mailing list without your permission. 

We never sell or distribute e-mail addresses or information about use of our website to outside parties. If Choice of Games is ever acquired or sells substantially all of its assets, we may need to change these policies, but you will be informed in advance and will have the option of having your e-mail address deleted from our records at that time. 

Our privacy policy may be changed in the future, but it will always protect your privacy to the best of our ability while providing you with the best game experience that we can. If we need to change our policy, we will publicize any changes before they go into effect, including at a minimum an update to this privacy policy and a post on our blog.
