# Privacy – Choice Weekly

Choice Weekly (“ **Choice Weekly** “) operates Choice Weekly.com and may operate other websites. It is Choice Weekly policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

**Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, Choice Weekly collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Choice Weekly purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Choice Weekly visitors use its website. From time to time, Choice Weekly may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Choice Weekly also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Choice Weekly.com blogs/sites. Choice Weekly only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to Choice Weekly websites choose to interact with Choice Weekly in ways that require Choice Weekly to gather personally-identifying information.

Those who engage in transactions with Choice Weekly are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Choice Weekly collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Choice Weekly. Choice Weekly does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
