# Privacy Policy - Check My IP

[](https://web.archive.org/)

Welcome to check-my-ip.net, the home of IP Geolocation and IP Resources for better IP related queries. This website was built to offer a to z solution on IPv4 addresses, and how it relates to TCP/IP and Internet. There are times when you need to identify where your web visitors are coming from. You might have an ecommerce website, and would like to know where your potential customers are, pre-populate country code on forms, display different language and reduce credit card fraud based on geographic location. Or, you might want to fight against illegal spammers and hackers, and would like to locate source of a problem. The major search engines such as Google, Yahoo and MSN/Bing are becoming ever more sophisticated and smart in their search algorithms, and incorporate historical and IP address data, it is now even more important than ever to ensure that you take the necessary precautions when designing a network of linked web sites. Also check and find out who your linking partners are, find where they are hosted and test what their IP Address is. This IP address checker will help you do that. The whois lookup will reveal name of the ISP who owns that IP address, and the country where it is originated from. If you're lucky, you might also find the city of origin. You may use 'traceroute' command to find clues to the location of the IP address. The names of the routers through which packets flow from your host to the destination host might hint at the geographical path of the final location.

1\. What is check-my-ip? check-my-ip is mapping of an IP address or MAC address to the real-world geographic location of an Internet connected to a computing device or mobile device. Geolocation involves in mapping IP address to the country, region (city), latitude/longitude, ISP and domain name among other useful things.   
2\. Where can I get a check-my-ip database? There are a number of commercially available geolocation databases, and their pricing and accuracy may vary. Ip2location, MaxMind, Tamo Soft and IPligence offer a fee based databases that can be easily integrated into an web application. Most geolocation database vendors offers APIs and example codes (in ASP, PHP, .NET and Java programming languages) that can be used to retrieve geolocation data from the database. We use Ip2Location database to offer a free geolocation data on our website. There are also freely available geolocation databases. Vendors offering commercial geolocation database also offer a Lite or Community edition that provides IP-to-Country mappings.   
3\. How accurate is check-my-ip? Accuracy of check-my-ip database varies depending on which database you use. For IP-to-country database, some vendors claim to offer 98% to 99% accuracy although typical Ip2Country database accuracy is more like 95%. For IP-to-Region (or City), accracy range anywhere from 50% to 75% if neighboring cities are treated as correct. Considering that there is no official source of IP-to-Region information, 50+% accuracy is pretty good.   
4\. How does check-my-ip work? ARIN Whois database provides a mechanism for finding contact and registration information for IP resources registered with ARIN. The IP whois information is available for free, and determining the country from this database is relatively easy. When an organization requires a block of IP addresses, a request is submitted and allocated IP addresses are assigned to a requested ISP. Another important and useful service from check-my-ip.net   
check-my-ip maintains a history of IP addresses for both known spammers as well as senders with good email practices. This information contributes to the check-my-ip Reputation System, which gives the check-my-ip Spam & Virus Firewall the ability to block or allow a message based on the sender's IP address. In addition to IP reputation, the check-my-ip team maintains reputation on URLs, which gives the check-my-ip Spam & Virus Firewall the ability to quickly block an email based on a poorly-rated URL contained in the message. By combining both the IP and reputation data, check-my-ip Networks can easily determine whether a message is spam or legitimate email. Once identified, check-my-ip can implement countermeasures to mitigate these threats.   
check-my-ip Reputation is one of the many techniques check-my-ip Networks employs within the check-my-ip Spam & Virus Firewall to reinforce its superior 95 percent spam accuracy rate. The check-my-ip Reputation System is a real-time database of IP addresses that have a "poor" reputation for sending valid emails. check-my-ip maintains and manually verifies all IP addresses marked as "poor" on the check-my-ip Reputation System. 

Disclaimer: There is nothing in the which is 100% accurate result orienting either virtual world or physical world, so there may a few data have differences with other contemporary data finders.
