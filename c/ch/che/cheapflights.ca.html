		<div><p>Cheapflights.ca, which is operated by Cheapflights Media (USA) Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate its commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for Cheapflights.ca as well as email newsletters. It is important for you to understand what information we collect about you during your visit and what we do with that information.<br><br>This Privacy Policy only applies to information collected on Cheapflights.ca and not to information that is collected by Cheapflights through any other means. Your visit to Cheapflights.ca is subject to this Privacy Policy and our <a href="/terms-and-conditions/">Terms of Use</a>.<br><br><strong>1. Personal Information Collection and Use</strong><br><br>We do not collect personally identifiable information about you, except when you provide it to us. For example, if you submit a question to us, sign up for our weekly newsletters or a sweepstakes on Cheapflights.ca, you may be asked to provide certain information such as your contact information (name, email address, mailing address, etc.).<br><br>When you submit your personally identifiable information through Cheapflights.ca, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will use the information you provide us only for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or in connection with the service for which you provided such information. For example, if you opt-in to our email alert, we may use your email address to send you periodic emails. We may forward your contact information and inquiry to our affiliates and other divisions of our company that we feel can best address your inquiry or provide you with the requested service. We may also use the information you provide in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans. We may share or transfer such non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees, agents and partners.<br><br>We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include, without limitation, customer support and fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that coordinate mailings). Such third parties may be provided with access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose.<br><br>In addition, we may disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal proceeding or governmental request.<br><br><strong>2. Email addresses</strong></p><p>We do not want you to receive unwanted email from us. We try to make it easy to opt-out of any service you have asked to receive. If you sign-up to our email newsletters we do not sell, exchange or give your email address to a third party.</p><p>Email addresses are collected via the Cheapflights.ca Web site, co-registration partners and third-party marketing lists and promotions. Users have to physically opt-in to receive the Cheapflights.ca newsletter and a verification email is sent. Cheapflights is clearly and conspicuously named at the point of collection.</p><p>Cheapflights uses email addresses to send its newsletters and occasional mailings to assist in market research.</p><p>We sometimes run sweepstakes with our partners and sweepstakes entries may require you to provide an email address. These email addresses may be shared with the partner running the competition. We try to make it very clear when this is the case and we have no responsibility for subsequent use or distribution of email addresses by our partners.</p><p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:cheapflights@list.cheapflights.ca">cheapflights@list.cheapflights.ca</a>. Alternatively, please visit <a href="/email-newsletter/">Email Newsletter</a> to be removed from future communications.</p><p>The security of your personal information, including your email address and zip code, is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during registration and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100 per cent secure, however. Therefore, though we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p><p>If you have any questions about the security on our Web site, please visit our "Contact Us" page and a designated Cheapflights correspondent will respond to your query.</p><p>If we decide to change our email practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we think appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p><p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.
