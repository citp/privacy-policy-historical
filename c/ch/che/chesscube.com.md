* #### Cookies and log files

A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.

We use both "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies on the website. We use the session cookies to keep track of you whilst you navigate the website. We use the persistent cookies to enable our website to recognise you when you visit.

Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.

We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. Google's privacy policy is available at: <http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html>.

Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking "Tools", "Internet Options", "Privacy", and selecting "Block all cookies" using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.

As is done with most web sites, we log each visit to each web page. A log entry can contain information typically found in the "header" of your web browser's request such as the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day. We may also log your cookie's identification number and the URL of the last site you visited. This log information is important for security, audit, quality improvement, as well as for monitoring the health of our service.

* #### Managing your information

You can manage the information you share with us and with other users of the service.

You can unsubscribe from email messages about the service by updating your subscriber preferences. Note that sometimes we may need to send you notifications by email whether you have selected to receive email messages from us or not.

When you log in to the service, you can use the settings options on your profile to manage the information you make visible to other users of the service.

You can also manage notifications received on Facebook either within the application or through your privacy settings on Facebook.

Note that sometimes limiting the data you make available can have an adverse effect on your enjoyment of the service.

* #### Disclosures

We may disclose information about you to any of our employees, officers, agents, suppliers or subcontractors insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes as set out in this privacy policy.

In addition, we may disclose information about you:

  1. to the extent that we are required to do so by law;
  2. in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings;
  3. in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk); and
  4. to the purchaser (or prospective purchaser) of any business or asset which we are (or are contemplating) selling.



Except as provided in this privacy policy, we will not provide your information to third parties.

* #### International data transfers

Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate in order to enable us to use the information in accordance with this privacy policy.

In addition, personal information that you submit for publication on the website will be published on the Internet and may be available, via the Internet, around the world.

You expressly agree to such transfers of personal information.

* #### Children under the age of thirteen (13) years

We are concerned about the safety and privacy of all our users, particularly children. For this reason, parents or guardians of children under the age of 13 who wish to allow their children access to the Service must create an account that is maintained by a legal guardian of at least 18 years old and monitor the child's usage. By allowing a child access to your account, you also give your child permission to access all areas of the Service. Please remember that the Service is designed to appeal to a broad audience. Accordingly, as the legal guardian, it is your responsibility to determine whether any of the Service areas and/or Content are appropriate for your child.

* #### Security of your personal data

Protecting your personal data is important to us. We will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.

We will store all the personal information you provide on our secure (password- and firewall- protected) servers. All electronic payment transactions you make to us will be encrypted using SSL technology.

All chat messages are not encrypted and could possibly be intercepted by a third-party over the internet. You are strongly cautioned not to share sensitive personal information on our site. We do not actively monitor all chat messages, but these will be captured and brought to out attention if a user reports you or another chat participant via our abuse facility.

Just a reminder: data transmission over the Internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the Internet.

You are responsible for keeping your password and user details confidential. We will never ask you for your password.

* #### Third party websites

The website contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of third party websites.

* #### Policy amendments

We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time by posting a new version on our website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy with any changes.

We may also notify you of changes to our privacy policy by email.

* #### Your rights

You may instruct us to provide you with any personal information we hold about you. Provision of such information may be subject to the payment of a fee (currently fixed at US$ 20.00).

You may instruct us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes by email at any time. (In practice, you will usually either expressly agree in advance to our use of your personal data for marketing purposes, or we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of the use of your personal data for marketing purposes.)

* #### Updating information

Please let us know if the personal information that we hold about you needs to be corrected or updated.

* #### Contact
