# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This policy (together with our [Terms of Website Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions/) and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

## Information about us

The website at www.cheapflights.co.za ("our site") is a site operated by Momondo Group Limited, to which the words "we", "us" and "our" refer. We are registered in England and Wales under company number 03914064. The address of our registered office and principal place of business is One Alfred Place, London WC1E 7EB, United Kingdom. For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 ("the Act") we are the data controller, and are registered in the Data Protection Register under registration number Z7714834.

## Information that we may collect from you

We may collect and process the following data about you:- 

  * information that you provide by filling in forms on our site. This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our site, subscribing to our service, posting material or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a competition or promotion sponsored by us, and when you report a problem with our site;
  * a record of any correspondence with you;
  * your responses to our requests to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them;
  * details of which of our services you are interested in;
  * details of your visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, web logs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise, and the resources that you access;
  * information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers; and
  * information obtained from cookies, as to which please see below.



## Email addresses

We do not want you to receive unwanted email from us. We try to make it easy for you to opt out of any service that you have asked to receive. If you sign up to our email newsletters we do not sell, exchange or give your email address to a third party save as explained in the section below entitled "disclosure of your information". 

Email addresses are collected via our site, co-registration partners and third party marketing lists and promotions. Users have to opt in to receive our newsletter and a verification email is sent. We are clearly and conspicuously named at the point of collection. 

We use email addresses to send our weekly Newsletter and occasional mailings to assist in market research. 

We sometimes run competitions with our partners and competition entries may require you to provide an email address. These email addresses may be shared with the partner running the competition. We try to make it very clear when this is the case, and we disclaim any responsibility for subsequent use or distribution of email addresses by our partners. 

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by contacting us at the above address. 

The security of your personal information, including your email address and postcode, is important to us. We follow generally-accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during registration and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, though we strive to use commercially-acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

If you have any questions about the security on our website, please contact by us by post (at the address given above) and one of our designated correspondents will respond to your query. 

If we decide to change our email practices, we will post those changes to this privacy policy, the homepage of our site, and other places that we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

## Where we store your personal data

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. 

## Uses made of the information

We use information held about you in various ways including:

  * to ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer;
  * to provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes;
  * to allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so;
  * to notify you about changes to our service.



## Disclosure of your information

  * We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.
  * We may disclose your personal information to third parties:
  * in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; 
  * if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets.
  * if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply any of our terms and conditions, including our Website Terms of Use; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction;
  * in the form of aggregated information about our users in order to provide them with data about target audiences.



## Your rights

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us by post (One Alfred Place, London WC1E 7EB, United Kingdom). 

Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates.

Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites. 

## Access to information

The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of 134 South African Rand (£10 GBP) to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.
