This information is not specific to an individual. While anonymous information does not tell us anything about the user specifically, it does tell how they used our site. This policy only covers the use of cookies by us. No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities unless legally compelled to do so, such as in the event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect log files.

 **Collecting information on CHEKI Members**

As part of registering for Email or SMS alerts with CHEKI, we collect personal contact information from you in order for you to receive alerts. 

We will only use this information to send you alerts of new advertisements on the CHEKI website that meets your preferences or to alert you to new products and services on the Cheki website or to alert you to potential fraud, security matter or false advertising if we detect it. 

Email Alerts and SMS Alerts are an optional service. CHEKI requests that you provide information relating to your preferences as well as your email address or SMS number so that we may notify you via email or SMS of new vehicles specific to your needs. Users can modify or delete their alert profiles online via [Email Alerts Unsubscribe](http://www.cheki.co.ke/email-unsubscribe) or [SMS Alerts Unsubscribe](http://www.cheki.co.ke/sms-unsubscribe).

Making an online Contact Seller Request to an advertisement on CHEKI is a free and optional service that does not require registration. 

Contact Seller Requests require you to complete mandatory fields (name, phone and email) so that the advertiser can identify and contact you. These details are forwarded directly on to the third party advertiser. 

By submitting a Contact Seller form on CHEKI you are requesting that CHEKI pass the information to the Advertiser.

**CHEKI Partners & Advertisers**
