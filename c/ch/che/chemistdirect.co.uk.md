# Privacy Policy

Chemist Direct are committed to protecting your privacy. We will not pass on any of the information provided by you to another third party.

The information collected will only be used to ensure we offer you the best service possible through our own internal market analysis.

We ask for the minimum amount of information needed to conduct the transaction. On Pharmacy only products we ask for further information on symptoms, allergies, medical history only with the aim of ensuring the pharmacist can review your order and feel comfortable with supplying the medicines. This information will remain totally confidential.

We use Steamline Direct (a service from Natwest Bank) to ensure all payments are conducted over secure lines. This means that Chemist Direct will not see your credit/debit card information. This information is sent directly to the bank, who will authorise the payment and inform us that the payment has cleared.

Should you have any query or comment on this privacy policy, please e-mail customer services: [ CustomerServices@chemistdirect.co.uk](mailto:CustomerServices@chemistdirect.co.uk)
