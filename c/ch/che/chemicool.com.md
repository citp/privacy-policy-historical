# About Chemicool

### About Chemicool

Chemicool was the brainchild of David D. Hsu. of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA. The website went online in 1996 and since then we have been trying to help out anyone involved in chemistry. 

The data for this site were acquired with help from the following people; a big thanks goes out to all of them: Cabrol D.; Moore J. W and Kotz J. C. Additionally, the Perkin-Elmer Periodic Table v2.02g was used for Atomic mass, density, volume, group, heat of fusion, heat of vaporization, specific heat, and shells. 

More recently, we have been updating pages with images, YouTube chemistry clips and a lot more information. 

Since the site's launch we have won some awards. "Ten Cool Sites" for Exploratorium Learning Studio's best in Science, Art, & K-12 sites would be our best achievement so far. 

We are working hard to get more of these awards, so keep following our progress. 

I hope you find Chemicool interesting and helpful.
