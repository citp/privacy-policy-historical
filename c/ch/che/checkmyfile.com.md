## Privacy Practices

#### How we use your information

Your IP address is used to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your search requirements and to gather broad demographic information.

When you register on checkmyfile, we ask you for identification information (such as your name and date of birth), contact information (such as your address, email address amd telephone number) and secret information that you share with us (such as your password). We **do not share** any of this information with any third party, other than for obvious purposes (for example we need to give your name address and date of birth to the credit reference agencies when we search you). We use your telephone number only to contact you in case of payment issues arising on any subscription product you purchase from us.

#### Authentication - ensuring we only provide your data to you

If you choose to use our instant, online authentication system, and if you are making use of our 30 day free trial offer, as a first step in our processes we will seek your credit or debit card details and will pre-authorise your card for the initial payment. Pre-authorisation enables us to help prevent fraud, is one of the many elements of our online authentication process, and ensures that the card details that you have provided are both valid and correct. Pre-authorisation also ensures that your card is good for the initial payment due at the end of the 30 day free trial period, if you do not cancel during the 30 day period. No payment is taken from your card at the time of pre-authorisation, although please note that on online bank statements it may appear as if your card has been debited, even though no money has changed hands. If you wish, you can ask us to request your bank to remove the pre-authorisation simply by emailing us.

If you have either trialled our subscription services, or have purchased a one-off report, we may ask for your driving licence number, National Insurance number, and details about your financial commitments. We use this information to help verify your identity, using a complicated system of validation checks. We never reveal exactly how we do this, as if we did, our methods would soon fall into the hands of criminals, and that would defeat the object. We store the information you give us during the authentication process only for the purposes of fraud prevention. If you do not wish to provide this information, you do not have to do so. Instead, you can be authenticated using our postal 'security key' method, which usually takes one working day and is explained more fully when you buy.

From time to time we may need to authenticate you more carefully. The reason is always to ensure that we are releasing your personal information only to you. We will usually ask you to provide original bank statements or credit card statements addressed to you at both your current and previous addresses. We **do not extract** any information from the statements, all your data is kept confidential whilst being processed and are returned to you after being used to verify your addresses.

#### Postcode based information

Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This information is not held on an individual basis. We use this data to tailor your experience at our site, showing content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. For example, we use profile data to help identify lenders who extend credit to people with your credit rating, so that we may advise you and others of our findings. We **do not pass** your personal information to any third party except when under compulsion of law or with your consent to do so.

#### Links to other websites

checkmyfile contains links to other sites. Credit Reporting Agency is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

#### Online surveys

Our online surveys are optional. The information you provide as an individual respondent is **kept confidential** and is aggregated with all other responses to provide the survey results.

#### Security

checkmyfile has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. These include the issue and use of passwords, powerful encryption and computer firewalls to guard against hacking. From time to time we may have to suspend services whilst we investigate any attempted breach of security. You are also obligated, under the Terms and Conditions you agree to abide by when you use our services, to report any suspected breach to us immediately.

#### Supplementation Information

checkmyfile supplements the information that you provide with information received from third parties, (such as the Royal Mail Postcode Address File, which helps confirm your address).
