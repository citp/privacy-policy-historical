**How does Kitbag protect visitor information?**

Kitbag has a committed Security Policy. Kitbag will retain copies of the information provided when you register on the website, order any products from the site and enter into any competitions. Kitbag implements a number of sophisticated security measures to ensure the safety of any personal information provided. The information is contained on a secure server, which is accessible only by a limited number of employees who have authorised access rights to such information. All sensitive and credit card information supplied by any visitor to chelseamegastore.com is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. SSL is commonly-used for managing the security of message transmission on the Internet through public-and-private key encryption and a digital certificate that establishes your credentials when doing Internet business or other on-line transactions. This certificate is issued by a certification authority, in our case Verisign. To see the certificate for this site click Verisign here. When you are asked to enter any personal details or credit card information the website will be secure. This is easily identifiable by an icon in the bottom of the browser window resembling an unbroken key or a closed lock. SSL ensures that the information being sent is secure. Your card number will be encrypted and replaced by a unique transaction reference number. Kitbag uses online bank secure servers provided by DataCash and does not hold any customer card details on any Kitbag server at any time. To remove any name and address details please see remove details section in the Kitbags help menu.

**Kitbag's Policy for Children**

Kitbag realises and understands that many children will visit the Chelsea Megastore but encourages all persons under 13 to consult with their parents or legal guardian before submitting any information to this website and indeed any other website. However, Kitbag believes that ultimately it is the responsibility of parents or legal guardian to supervise children when online and recommend that parental control tools be put in place. No information collected from anyone under the age of 18 will be used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatever as is stated when you register for competitions or promotions. Although anyone under the age of 13 is able to participate in competitions and promotions, notification of a win or prize will be sent directly to the parent or legal guardian identified in the initial registration process. Any publication of a competition winner's personal details for visitors under 18 will require parental or legal guardian consent during registration.
