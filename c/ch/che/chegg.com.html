<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
 
<p>We at Chegg, Inc. ("Chegg") have created this Privacy Policy to describe our practices regarding information we collect through our web sites, mobile

"Services"). Your use of our Services is also governed by our <a href="/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
 
<p>Note about Children: Our services are not intended for, marketed to or available to individuals younger than the age of 13, and individuals younger than
the age of 13 should not submit personal information to us.</p>

<p><strong>WE FULLY DESCRIBE OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES BELOW IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. THIS SUMMARY PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING
OUR USE AND SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION, AND THIRD PARTIES WHO MAY SERVE ADVERTISEMENTS AND WHO MAY SET <a href="#cookies">COOKIES</a> OR <a href="#beacons">WEB BEACONS</a> OR SIMILAR TRACKING
TECHNOLOGIES WHEN YOU USE THE SERVICES, BUT PLEASE REVIEW OUR FULL PRIVACY POLICY BEFORE USING OUR SERVICES.</strong></p>
 
<p>We primarily use the information we collect when you use the Services in connection with your relationship with Chegg, your use of the Services, and for
sending you information from us or on behalf of certain third parties. This includes linking you to other members of the Chegg community and providing
offers to you based on information you provide or we collect or your use of the Services. Please review the <a href="#info">"INFORMATION COLLECTION"</a>
and <a href="#use">"HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION"</a> sections of this Privacy Policy for a full description of the information we collect, including
Personal Information, and how we use that information. Remember that if you create a Profile or participate in community forums and similar features on the
Services, your information may be public. Note that we do not share your Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes without your
consent; however, we may share your Personal Information under certain limited circumstances. For more details, please review the section below entitled
<a href="#sharing">"Information Sharing."</a></p>
 
<p>Chegg works with network advertisers, ad agencies , analytics service providers and other vendors to serve third party advertisements on and through the
Services, to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Services, including the pages viewed and the actions users take when visiting the
Services; to serve our advertisements on other web sites, within mobile Apps, and elsewhere online; and to provide us with information regarding the use of
the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. For example, if you click on a Chegg advertisement, our service provider(s) may be able to tell
us the advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement. You may also see third party ads on the Services. The advertisements you
see may be served by one or more third parties, who may use information about your activities on the Services, and other web sites and services, to provide
you targeted advertising based upon your interests. We do not share Personal Information (information that identifies you as a specific individual, such as
your name or e-mail address) with these third parties, but ad network providers, the advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers and other
vendors may set and access their own tracking devices (including <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> and <a href="#beacons">web beacons</a>) and they may otherwise collect or
have access to information about you and your online browsing activities. Please review <a href="#thirdparty">"THIRD PARTY AD NETWORKS AND ANALYTICS
PROVIDERS"</a> for additional information. Some of the companies who serve these targeted ads participate in a self-regulatory program that allows you to
opt-out of having information about you used for this purpose, and you may access that opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/truste/">here</a>. 
Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads
while using the Services and elsewhere online.</p>
 
<p><strong><a id="info" name="info">INFORMATION COLLECTION</a></strong></p>
 
<p>1. Registration and Other Information You Provide</p>
 
<p>The Services may collect "<strong>Personal Information</strong>" (which is information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual,
such as your name and email address), account information (such as a password or other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your
account) and demographic or other information (such as your school, gender, age or birthdate and zip code and information about your interests and
preferences). We will also collect payment information (typically, credit card account information) if you choose to purchase products or services through
the Services. Any information combined with Personal Information will be treated as Personal Information.</p>
 
<p>2. Your Profile, Community Forums and User Content</p>
 
<p>You may have the opportunity to create a profile, which consists of information about you, which may include Personal Information, photographs,
information about your academic and work history, your interests and activities, your use of the Services and other information ("Profile"). Some of the
information in your Profile may be visible to third parties or to everyone, depending on the nature of the information and the privacy settings you choose
when you sign in and go to your Account on the website or other Services where you created your Profile. Chegg may also make the information contained in
your Profile accessible through means other than the Chegg website (such as through an app or an application programming interface (API)). Your Profile may
also be indexed by and displayed by internet search providers when someone searches for your name. Chegg does not control how frequently third-party search
engines update their indexes; consequently their information may be outdated and still available for a period of time even if you discontinue use of the
service.</p>
 
<p><strong>Note that in order to provide services and opportunities to you, educational organizations, scholarship providers and other third parties may be
able to review certain information in your Profile , whether or not you have limited public access to that information . You may have the opportunity to
control whether this information is shared, but some information may be shared automatically -- all as disclosed on the website or other Services where you
created your Profile. Chegg does not share your contact information (email, full postal address or phone number) with those third parties unless you
request or agree to that sharing. However, Chegg may send you information and offers from third parties and information about the Services, and you may not
be able to opt-out from these messages without closing your account.</strong></p>
 
<p>The Services may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly in forums, through interactive features and through other
communication functionality ("Community Forums"). You may choose, through such features or otherwise, to submit or post reviews, problems, suggestions,
ideas, solutions, questions, answers, class notes, course outlines, comments, testimonials, feedback, messages, images, videos, text or other material
("<strong>User Content</strong>"). Your User Content may also be posted in your Profile. You may edit or remove your profile information, but you may not
be able to remove answers or postings or other uploaded material.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Note that anything you post to a Community Forum may be public</em>. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information in your
Profile or a Community Forum, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not
apply.</strong></p>
 
<p>In addition, the Services may allow members to communicate and collaborate with each other. If you create an account, participate in a Community Forum
or choose to communicate with others through the Services, certain information about you may be disclosed in connection with your or others use of the
Services, including certain information about you and your network (such as your name and profile photo, the number of your connections, and the names and
pictures of your connections). We allow other users to use contact information they have about you, such as your email address, to find you, including
through contact importers and search, and they may also contact you through the Services.</p>
 
<p>3. Third Party Services, Social Media Platforms, and Information Third Parties Provide About You</p>
 
<p>Third parties may provide us with information about you. For example, if you are on a third party web site, and you opt-in to receive information from
us, that third party will forward information about you to us so that we may contact you as requested.</p>
 
<p>The Services may permit interactions between the Services and a third party web site or service, such as enabling you to "like" a product within our
Services or "share" content to other web sites. If you choose to "like" or "share" content or to otherwise post information from or via the Services to a
third party web site, feature or application, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party web site may have access to information about
you and your use of our Services. Similarly, if you post information on a third party platform that references Chegg or one of the Services, your post may
be published on our Services in accordance with terms of that third party. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our
web site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted
directly on our Services. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
 
<p>You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature through our Services (such as logging in through Facebook Connect or
otherwise linking the Services with another web site or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such as one of our Facebook
applications or a similar application or feature on a third party web site or service) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share)
information about you, including personal information. Information about you, including your name and profile photo, may be shown to other users of the
Services if you are logged in through the Services or through a third party web site or service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or
feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously
collected. When you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your activity on our Services with that third party web site or service, which may
then collect information about your visits to our Services and may publish that activity as you request to your profile or similar feature with that third
party (such as if you choose to share a purchase you made on Chegg.com with your connections on the third party website). In addition, we may receive
information about you if other users of a third party web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about
you is otherwise accessible through your "connections" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or
interactive service.</p>
 
<p>The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third
party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with
regard to what is visible to others on that third party web site and service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which
case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. In
addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site or service give us access to their profiles and you are one of
their "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social
networking or other third party web site or interactive service.</p>
 
<p>We also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods
you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that
we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Services.
In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.</p>
 
<p>4. Referral Features and Gift Certificates</p>
 
<p>The Services may offer referral features whereby users may use an email tool to invite friends to use the Services using a one-time email. Chegg stores
this information for the purpose of verification, as well as tracking the success of our referral program. Chegg will not use those referred email
addresses for any other purpose (unless, of course, the referred user comes to a Service and registers as a user, in which case Chegg may use the email
address provided by the referred user in accordance with this Privacy Policy). The referred person may contact us at <a href="mailto:legaldept@chegg.com">legaldept@chegg.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our active database.</p>
 
<p>If you purchase a gift certificate for another person, we will ask you for that person's name and email address, as well as for an optional personal
message. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email including an invitation to visit the Services as well as their gift code. Chegg stores
information such as the gift certificate recipient's name and email address for the sole purpose of verification. Chegg does not sell or disclose any of
this information to any outside sources or parties and collects this information only to maintain records that a gift certificate was purchased and sent to
a recipient. Vouchers purchased through Cheggdeals are not gift certificates and must be used according to the terms of the voucher.</p>
 
<p>5. Information Chegg Collects Automatically When You Access The Services</p>
 
<p>Like other websites and online services, we and our analytics providers and other third party service providers may automatically collect certain "Usage
Information" whenever you access and use the Services, including, without limitation, by viewing information about a course or school, renting a textbook,
asking or answering questions, viewing another user's profile, sending a message, searching for a person or information, or by clicking on an
advertisement.</p>
 
<p>Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to our Services (if
applicable), the search terms you entered into a search engine that lead you to our Services (if applicable), all of the areas within our Services that you
visit (including information about any ads you may view), and the time of day you used the Services, among other information. We may use Usage Information
for a variety of purposes, including to tell you about people or events nearby, to provide special offers, to serve advertisements, to select appropriate
content to display to you, and to enhance or otherwise improve the Services and our products.</p>
 
<p>In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for any computer, mobile phone or other device
(any, a "Device") you may use to access the Services. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access a
Service, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service
providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access a Service. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if
we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.</p>
 
<p>Usage Information is collected via tracking technologies, including:</p>
 
<p><a id="cookies" name="cookies"><strong>Cookies and Log Files:</strong></a> Chegg uses cookies and web log files to track usage of our Services. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides
on your computer, and which allows Chegg to recognize you as a user when you return using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do
not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our Services as fully as intended. Log files are the record of your visits to the Services and include Usage
Information. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience when you use
the Services. Third parties may also set cookies as you interact with the Service.</p>
 
<p>One type of cookie we use, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you've logged in to your account on the Services. If you do not log out of your
account, then the next time you visit, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to log in before using
the Services. Of course, if you are using a public computer or sharing your private computer with others, you should log out of your account after each
visit. If you log out of a Service, you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. We also use a
cookie which functions as a "session" cookie, meaning that it is used to identify a particular visit. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you
close your web browser.</p>
 
<p><a id="beacons" name="beacons"><strong>Web Beacons:</strong></a> We, as well as our affiliate program partners, service providers, and other third parties, may employ a software
technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs), that help us better manage content on our Services by informing us of what content is
effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users
for our affiliate program. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are
about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. This information is used to help improve the overall quality and experience of our Services.</p>
 
<p><a id="script" name="script">An <strong>Embedded Script</strong></a> is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the
links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device from our server or a third party service provider and is
deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.</p>
 
<p>In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.</p>
 
<p><a id="use" name="use"><strong>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></a></p>
 
<p>We use information about you, including Personal Information, the information you provide in your Profile, User Content, and Usage Information to: (1)
allow you to participate in features we offer or to provide related customer service, including, without limitation, to respond to your questions,
complaints or comments; (2) tailor content, recommendations and offers we display to you; (3) process a transaction you initiate; (4) provide you with
information, products, services, or suggestions; (5) send or display to you and others using the Services special offers or advertisements from us, our
advertisers, or third-parties; (6) process your registration with our Services, including verifying your e-mail address is active and valid; (7) improve
the Services and our products, and for internal business purposes, including the measurement of ad effectiveness; (8) contact you with regard to your use
of the Services and, in our discretion, changes to our policies; and (9) permit other Chegg users to contact you, and vice versa; (10) to provide you with
location features and services (e.g., telling you about local deals and events); and (11) as described in the Privacy Policy and for purposes disclosed at
the time you provide your information or otherwise with your consent.</p>
 
<p>Note that we may create, facilitate or display social advertisements, whereby your name and profile photo may be used to advertise products and services
to your network based on your use of the Services and your interactions with Chegg and third parties through the Services. If we are utilizing Social Ads
on one of our Services, you will be able to opt-out through your account settings for that Service.</p>
 
<p>Please note that information submitted on the Services via a "Contact Us" or other similar function may not receive a response. We will not use the
information provided via these functions to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request unless you agree otherwise.</p>
 
<p><a id="sharing" name="sharing"><strong>INFORMATION SHARING</strong></a></p>
 
<p>Chegg does not share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent. Chegg may share non-Personal
Information, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic information and Usage Information with third parties, including advertisers, content providers,
and analytics providers; and third parties may collect non-Personal Information when you visit the Services. We also may share your Personal Information
with third parties with your consent, as disclosed at the time you provide us with information, and as described below or otherwise in this Privacy
Policy:</p>
 
<p>1. <strong>Educational Institutions:</strong> We work with colleges, universities, scholarship providers and educational institutions ("Educational
Institutions") to provide targeted recruiting and outreach to some of our members. We may allow Educational Institutions to review information in your
Profile (such as hometown, grade point average, and graduation year), whether or not you have chosen to restrict public access to some of that information.
However, we do not share your contact information (email address, full postal address or phone number) with these Educational Institutions without your
consent, but we may send you information on their behalf. This is a fundamental element of our free Services. In addition, you may indicate that you would
like to receive additional information from Educational Institutions or other third parties and we will then share your information with those parties so
that they may contact you per your request. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties. If you later decide that you no
longer want to receive communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.</p>
 
<p>2. <strong>When You Request That We Share Your Information.</strong> We may offer opportunities and features through the Services that are brought to
you by a third party or that otherwise involve sharing your information with a third party. If you request or agree at that time to have your information
shared, your information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party.
You also may request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature, a widget or third party application, that we share information about you with a
third party and we will typically do so under those circumstances.</p>
 
<p>3. <strong>Service Providers.</strong> We will share your Personal Information with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific
services to you or to us as part of our Services, but subject to confidentiality obligations which limit their use and disclosure of such information. If
you purchase any products or services, our billing partner will receive billing and financial information (e.g., credit card numbers) necessary to process
your charges, including your postal and e-mail addresses, depending on your payment method.</p>
 
<p>4. <strong>Administrative, Legal Reasons &amp; Academic Integrity Investigations.</strong> We may also disclose your information, including Personal
Information, in response to a subpoena or when required by law; to defend our rights; in response to a written request from law enforcement regarding an
investigation into criminal activity that may have occurred through or in any way using Chegg's Services or property; to provide information to a claimed
owner of intellectual property who claims that content you have provided to us infringes on their rights; upon request of an academic institution connected
to an investigation into academic integrity to protect and/or defend any applicable Terms of Use or other policies applicable to the Services; or to
protect the personal safety, rights, property or security of any organization or individual. We may also use Device Identifiers, including IP addresses, to
identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies in
our discretion. These disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.</p>
 
<p>5. <strong>Business Transitions</strong> Chegg may share Personal Information with its parent, subsidiaries and affiliates, primarily for business and
operational purposes. In the event that Chegg goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a

<p><a id="thirdparty" name="thirdparty"><strong>THIRD PARTY AD NETWORKS AND ANALYTICS PROVIDERS</strong></a></p>
 
<p>Chegg works with network advertisers, ad agencies , analytics service providers and other vendors to serve third party advertisements on and through the
Services, to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Services, including the pages viewed and the actions users take when visiting the
Services; to serve our advertisements on other web sites, within mobile Apps, and elsewhere online; and to provide us with information regarding the use of
the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. For example, if you click on a Chegg advertisement, our service provider(s) may be able to tell
us the advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement; likewise, if you click on an ad you see on our Services, our service
provider(s) may be able to tell which page you were visiting on our Services and pass that information to the advertiser. The advertisements you see may be
served by one or more third parties, who may use information about your activities on the Services, and other web sites and services, to provide you
targeted advertising based upon your interests.</p>
 
<p>Some of the companies who serve these targeted ads participate in a self-regulatory program that allows you to opt-out of having information about you
used for this purpose, and you may access that opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/">here</a>. Please note this does not opt you out
of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads while using the Services and elsewhere online.</p>
 
<p>We may share Usage Information about visitors with third party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors. We do not share Personal
Information (information that identifies you as a specific individual, such as your name or e-mail address) with these third parties, but ad network
providers, the advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers and other vendors may set and access their own tracking devices (including <a href="#cookies">cookies</a>
and <a href="#beacons">web beacons</a>) and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you (such as your general interest in
higher education and scholarships) and your online browsing activities.</p>
 
<p><a id="mobile" name="mobile"><strong>MOBILE USE</strong></a></p>
 
<p>If you use the Services through a mobile device or our mobile application, your mobile device ID, your mobile carrier, and your physical (GPS) location
may be transmitted to Chegg. You agree that Chegg may store and use that information for security purposes (for example, for user verification and to
ensure that Chegg's APIs are being used appropriately) and, if available, for purposes of assisting you in locating nearby shipping stores, schools or
other places of interest. If you wish to no longer allow Chegg to track your physical locations you may turn this off within your device settings. When you
place an order through the Services, you may be able to opt-in to receiving text messaging reminders from Chegg. If you choose to do so, you must provide
to Chegg your telephone number, which Chegg will store and use to send reminders to you. You may always opt-out by replying "STOP" to one of the text
messages received. You also acknowledge and agree that use of the Services through a mobile device may cause data to be displayed on and through your
mobile device which may be viewed by your mobile carrier or other access provider.</p>
 
<p><a id="updating" name="updating"><strong>UPDATING YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND CONTROL OVER CHEGG EMAILS</strong></a></p>
 
<p>You may be able to review the information you provided to us on a Service and make any desired changes to the information, or to the settings for your
account on that Service, by logging in to your account for that Service and editing or deleting the information. You also may be able to limit the
information you receive from us by adjusting your settings <a href="https://www.chegg.com/my/preferences">here</a>. All changes to your email settings and preferences must be made in your account preferences page which can be accessed through this link, or by using the unsubscribe button at the bottom of the Chegg email. However, we reserve the right to send you information on our behalf and on behalf of third
parties in connection with providing the Services. If you no longer want to receive information from us, you will need to close your account for that
Service.</p>
 
<p><a id="closing" name="closing"><strong>CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT</strong></a></p>
 
<p>If you wish to close your account with one of our Services, please send your request to <span>c</span><span>l</span><span>o</span><span>s</span><span>e</span><span>m</span><span>y</span><span>a</span><span>c</span><span>c</span><span>o</span><span>u</span><span>n</span><span>t</span><span>@</span><span>c</span><span>h</span><span>e</span><span>g</span><span>g</span><span>.com</span> and
we will remove your Personal Information and Profile, if applicable, from the active databases for the Service(s) you request. Please let us know which
Service(s) you wish to close and send your request using an email account that you have registered with Chegg under your name. You typically will receive a
response to a request sent to <span>c</span><span>l</span><span>o</span><span>s</span><span>e</span><span>m</span><span>y</span><span>a</span><span>c</span><span>c</span><span>o</span><span>u</span><span>n</span><span>t</span><span>@</span><span>c</span><span>h</span><span>e</span><span>g</span><span>g</span><span>.com</span> within five business days of our receiving it. Requests to change your email preferences or unsubscribe from all emails may not be made through this email address, but rather must be submitted through one of the channels set out in the previous section.</p>
 
<p>Even if your account is closed, information may remain in backup records and we may retain certain data if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or
future abuse or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery or if required by law.
All retained data will continue to be subject to the applicable privacy policy for the Service. Also, if you have posted content on or through the
Services, such as in Community Forums, we may not be able to delete it.</p>
 
<p><a id="thirdpartycontent" name="thirdpartycontent"><strong>THIRD PARTY CONTENT, LINKS TO OTHER SITES, AND CHEGG CONTENT FOUND OUTSIDE OF
THE SERVICES</strong></a></p>
 
<p>Certain content provided through the Services may be hosted and served by third parties, which may include third party widgets (such as those that allow
you to "like" or "share" content with third party web sites and online services. In addition, the Services may link to third party web sites or content
over which Chegg has no control and which are governed by the privacy policies and business practices of those third parties. In addition, third-party
partners of Chegg from whom your order through the Services may have different privacy policies which apply to such partner's use of your information.</p>
 
<p>Please also note that Chegg content and widgets may be included on web pages and web sites that are not associated with us and over which we have no
control. These third parties may independently collect data. Chegg is not responsible for the privacy practices or business practices of any third
party.</p>
 
<p><a id="security" name="security"><strong>SECURITY</strong></a></p>
 
<p>Chegg takes commercially reasonable security measures to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive
it. For example, when you enter sensitive information such as a credit card number and CCV2 number on our checkout forms, that information is encrypted
using secure socket layer (SSL) technology, to help protect the communications between you and our payment partners.</p>
 
<p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially
acceptable means to protect your personal information, as in any real-life scenario, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions
about security on our Services, you can email us at <a href="mailto:legaldept@chegg.com">legaldept@chegg.com</a>.</p>
 
<p><a id="consent" name="consent"><strong>CONSENT TO TRANSFER</strong></a></p>
 
<p>The Services are operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be
transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the Services, or providing us with any information, you fully understand and unambiguously
consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as
comprehensive as those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.</p>
 
<p><a id="changes" name="changes"><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></a></p>

<p><a id="california" name="california"><strong>California Residents - Your CA Privacy Rights</strong></a></p>
 
<p>Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in
California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the
third parties' direct marketing purposes and the categories of personal information the company shares. Alternatively, the law provides that a company that
has a privacy policy that provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties for those third parties'
direct marketing purposes may instead provide information on how to exercise that choice. Chegg qualifies for the alternative option; it has a
comprehensive privacy policy that sets forth that Chegg provides you choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties for their direct
marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you do not choose to opt-out at the time Chegg offers that choice, Chegg does not share your information
with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.</p>
 
<p>If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct
marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request to the following email address: <a href="mailto:legaldept@chegg.com">legaldept@chegg.com</a> or write to us at the
following mailing address: 3990 Freedom Circle, Santa Clara, CA 95054. You must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the subject field of
your e-mail or include it in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated mailing address. You must include your name, street address, city,
state, and zip code. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.</p>
