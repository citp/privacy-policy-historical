Such information may include your first and last name, your physical address, e-mail address, date of birth, geo-location, telephone number, and your billing information (including cardholder name, credit card number and expiration date).

If you purchase a product or service from us or register for a sweepstakes, contest or any other promotional offer on the Sites, we may request certain additional personally identifiable information from you. Certain personally identifiable information about you is required in order for you to register as a member, book travel itineraries, participate in a contest or sweepstakes, ask us a question, or for other purposes in connection with your use of the Sites.

We may also collect information about your visit, such as itineraries viewed or searched and booking made.

You may also provide PII or non-personally identifiable information about other people, such as their name, date of birth and gender. Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, the PII you provide about others is only used for the sole purpose of completing your request or for whatever reason it may have been provided. You must obtain the consent of such other person prior to providing us with any of their personally identifiable information.

We collect your location-based information for the purpose of customizing your experience and locating a place that you may be searching for in your area. We will only share this information with our mapping provider for the sole purpose of providing you the service. We may share your geo-location data with third parties for the purpose of them serving you ads for places (such as restaurants) in your area. If you do not wish to allow us to share your information in this manner please opt-out by contacting us at [feedback@cheapoair.ca](mailto:feedback@cheapoair.ca).

You may opt-out of location based services at any time by editing the setting at the device level or by emailing us at [feedback@cheapoair.ca](mailto:feedback@cheapoair.ca).

**With Whom CheapOair May Share Your PII**  
---  
Other than in the cases set forth in this Privacy Policy, you will be notified when personally identifiable information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information:

  * We may share your personally identifiable information with our parent company, corporate affiliates and subsidiaries, including but not limited to CheapOair.com. Our parent company, all of our affiliates and subsidiaries share our commitment to protect your personally identifiable information and comply with a policy at least as restrictive as our Privacy Policy.
  * Your personally identifiable information may be shared with our suppliers such as airlines, hotels, car rental partners, insurance suppliers, and/or activity, service providers or intermediaries (collectively, "Suppliers") who are directly or indirectly involved in providing you with services or other products you purchased from our Sites. By making a reservation on our Sites or through our mobile application, you authorize us to disclose to such Suppliers the information they require to verify your identity, complete the booking and deliver the services or products you purchased. In certain cases, Suppliers may use your personally identifiable information to prevent fraud and improve their service or product. These Suppliers are not controlled by CheapOair and any personally identifiable information disclosed to them is subject to their own privacy policies. As such, please review the privacy policy of each Supplier whose products you purchase through our Sites or mobile application.
  * We may also share your personally identifiable information with our business partners whose products or services may be offered on the Sites or who referred you to our Sites from another site. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of each website that referred you to our Sites or to which you are referred to from here.
  * Third party vendors who provide corporate services or functions on our behalf, including credit card processing, credit card verification, financial analysis, a mapping service provider to provide a map of the location you are looking for or the location you are currently in, customer service, call center services, marketing services, contest organization and administration, and fraud prevention may have access to your personally identifiable information. Such third party vendors have access to and may collect your personally identifiable information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share, sell, trade or use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. They are also required to follow restrictive data security practices. 
  * We may access, preserve and share your personally identifiable information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share your personally identifiable information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. If the ownership or control of all or part of the Sites or our assets changes, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to the new owner.

  
**Cookies and Tracking Technologies**  
---  
Cookies are data files which can be stored on your computer's hard drive, if your web browser allows it. Our Sites and mobile application use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags and scripts for the following purposes:

  * To help us to recognize you as a previous visitor on the Sites. For example, if you have an account with CheapOair.com, we use cookies to store your login information, so you will not need to enter your credentials each time your browser visits us to login to your account.
  * To enable us to customize your user experience with us, as well as the help customize ad content provided to you on other sites across the Internet. As an example, when you access a page on our Sites, a cookie is automatically set by us, our marketing partners or service providers to recognize your browser when you visit other websites and to present you with information and advertising content based on your apparent interests.
  * To help research, test and measure our Site's features and offerings, advertisements and related email campaigns.

While most browsers include the option of preventing the browser from accepting new cookies, please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access certain tools and functionalities offered by our Sites. 

In addition to cookies, CheapOair may use Web Beacons and Local Shared Objects to monitor traffic patterns, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand if you were referred to us from an online advertisement, to help measure the effectiveness of our offerings and advertisements, to help us understand which emails from us have been opened and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site and mobile application. 

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information about you automatically and store it in our log files. This information may include, but is not limited to, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and /or clickstream data. 

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We collect and use this information to improve services we offer you, to improve our marketing, analytics, or site functionality. 

We may use Local Storage (LS) such as HTML5. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Sites or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 to collect and store information. 

If you reject cookies, you may still use the Sites, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Sites may be limited. 

We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on our Sites and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and following the opt-out process. Please note this does not opt you out of being served generic ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.   
  
**Mobile Analytics**  
---  
We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile app.  
  
**Security**  
---  
The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number, date of birth, and/or geo-location data) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this [link](https://www.symantec.com/page.jsp?id=how-ssl-works). 

All of our secure servers use a high-grade encryption key (AES with 128 and 256 bit secret key). While the secure mode provides SSL encryption, pages will take longer to download. Most users choose to sign up or sign in using standard mode to achieve quicker response time. 

If you receive browser warnings when going from secure mode pages to non-SSL pages, it is most likely a warning that you are switching servers. As long as your data is entered on a secure mode page, it will only be transmitted to a secure server. 

We follow accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personally identifiable information when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser. 

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us.
