We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to your request.

To exercise any of these rights, you may review the information provided in Sections 4, 5, and 7, or contact us as described in the “How can I contact you with more questions?”section above.

If we provide any information about you to any such non-EU third party information processors, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.
