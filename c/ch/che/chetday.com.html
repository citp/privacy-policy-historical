          we gather information from users</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How we 
          collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, 
          the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. 
          For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register 
          for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, 
          such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information 
          when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and 
          chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, 
          ChetDay.com also collects information automatically and through the 
          use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For 
          example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use 
          cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. 
          Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, 
          sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, 
          or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement 
          while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also 
          gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose 
          not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser 
          to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access 
          certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name 
          and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features 
          according to your preferences.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What 
          we do with the information we collect</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like other 
          Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aggregated 
          Information (information that does not personally identify you) may 
          be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about 
          your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users 
          to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are 
          visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information 
          may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. 
          Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable 
          Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</font></p>
