In order to manage the programme effectively, we collect and use information of individuals. This notice sets out how and why we use your personal information (also referred to as ‘personal data’ or ‘your information’ in this document).

Personal data means any information which relates to you and which can be used to directly or indirectly identify you as an individual

We ensure that we comply with all applicable data protection laws when handling your information. Your personal data will be processed in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 of the European Union and the Data Protection Act 2018.

#### Who we are?

#### What is ‘processing’?

Processing your personal data means the **collection** , **storage** , and **use** of that data.

#### What personal data do we process?

We process various categories of personal data, depending on your relationship with Chevening and how you interact with us. The personal data we process about you may include:

  * Your name, title, gender, citizenship, and date of birth
  * Contact details such as email address(es), postal address(es), phone number(s), social media links
  * Your employment information
  * Photographs of you or which include you within a group



If you are applying for or have received an award we will also process data relevant to your status as an applicant, awardee, or alumnus. Such information will include:

  * Your education history including results of degrees
  * Extended employment information including current and past professional roles and your employer information
  * Results from the course studied on your Chevening Award



Data protection law classifies some data as 'special category data' due to its greater sensitivity. These include information about your health, religious beliefs, and political opinions, which enable us to analyse the diversity of applicants and awardees, and which enable us to support you during your award. Where you are not obliged to give us this data (for example in surveys) you may always choose not to tell us, and any options list that we offer will include 'prefer not to say'.

Where you are obliged to provide this data, for example provision of medical form as a condition of an award, we rely on our legitimate business interests as the legal basis for processing this form of data. In all cases, the legal **condition** for our holding this data is your explicit consent.

#### How do we collect your information?

We collect personal data from different sources. Most of our data will come from you, for example when you:

  * Enquire about our activities, our services, or ask us a question
  * Apply for a Chevening Award, at any stage of the application cycle
  * Email or get in contact with us in some way, complete forms, or complete surveys



We also collect your information when you visit our website [www.chevening.org ](http://www.chevening.org/)or our social media channels.

We sometimes obtain personal information from third party organisations. For example from the UK institution you are studying at or otherwise affiliated to for your Chevening Award, if you are a recent award recipient. Or from the alumni platform Chevening Connect if you are an alumnus.

Sometimes we may also obtain your information from publicly available sources such as internet searches and press sources, including media monitoring.

#### How do we use your information?

We may use your personal data for purposes including (but not limited to) the following:

Once your personal data is no longer required, we will ensure that it is deleted securely. In some cases we may retain a very limited amount of data for archiving purposes or to ensure that we can exclude you from further communications if necessary.

If you have any questions about how long we keep your personal data for, please contact us for more information regarding specific categories of personal data.
