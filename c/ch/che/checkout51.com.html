		<h1>Checkout 51 Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="container copy">
<h2>Last updated on May 28, 2014</h2>
	<p>Welcome to the Checkout 51 privacy policy. First of all, we'd like to say how seriously we take your privacy. Checkout 51 works when you upload photos of your grocery receipts and we understand that what appears on your receipt can sometimes be sensitive. Because of this, we want to make sure you are absolutely comfortable with what information is collected when you participate in Checkout 51, and how this information is used.</p>
	<p>This Privacy Policy applies to Checkout 51, wherever Checkout 51 exists, whether as a mobile application, or on a website (collectively, the "Service(s)"). This Privacy Policy covers Checkout 51's treatment of your personally identifiable information ("Personal Data") and other data that we gather when you use our Service. By using Checkout 51, you are consenting to the terms described in our Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use, located at www.checkout51.com/terms.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our use of your personally identifiable information, please submit a <a href="http://support.checkout51.com/anonymous_requests/new">support request</a> or contact us:
	</p><p>Checkout 51 Inc.<br>
	411 Richmond Street East, Suite 101<br>
	Toronto, ON, M5A 3S5, Canada</p>
	<h2>What personal data does Checkout 51 collect?</h2>
	<p>Personal information we receive from you:</p>
	<ul class="privacy-page">
		<li><u>Personal Data you provide.</u>  We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information. This includes when you register for Checkout 51 (for example, name, gender, location and email address), use certain Services, upload receipts, or connect your Checkout 51 account to online third party services such as Facebook, Twitter or other social networks. The information we receive from your social networks, is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our website or Service.</li>   
		<li><u>Receipt Data.</u>  When you upload receipts to Checkout 51, we collect information contained on the receipts such as the name and location of the store, information about the products and brands you purchased, your rewards card information (if applicable), coupons used, the total amount you spend, the prices you paid, and the date of your purchase (collectively, "Receipt Data").</li> 
	<p>Use of cookies and other technology to collect data:</p>
		<li><u>Mobile data.</u>  When you use our applications on your mobile device, we may receive or collect and store unique identification numbers associated with your device ("Device ID"), mobile carrier, device type and manufacturer, phone number, and, depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device (collectively, "Mobile Data"). This allows us to provide you with offers from local merchants when you are in the vicinity of their location. You can turn this feature off by adjusting your phone settings.</li>
		<li><u>Cookies and other tracking data.</u>  We may collect information using cookies, log file data, and clear gifs (also known as web beacons) (collectively, "Cookie Data") to track usage information, to remember you on our Service, and to provide additional functionality.

Log file information may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, information about your mobile device, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit, your actions on our websites or mobile applications, and other information that assists us in analyzing and improving the Service.</li>

	<p>Checkout 51 considers your Personal Data an essential part of our relationship with you and a key component in delivering you a great service.

	<ol class="privacy-page">
		<li>Business transactions and related companies – As we operate Checkout 51 we may buy or sell business assets or the company, merge with other companies, reorganize or dissolve.
