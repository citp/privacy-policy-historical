**Registration**

In order to become a member, users have to complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address). The site is password protected.

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that FCO/Chevening.com are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of these third party sites.

**Security**

This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, the information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration form asks users to enter personal information, that information is encrypted and is protected with SSL (Secure Socket Layer). While on a secure page, such as our registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, as will be the case for most of the time that a user is browsing the web. If you have any questions about the security at our web site, you can send an email to [chevening.online@britishcouncil.org](mailto:chevening.online@britishcouncil.org)
