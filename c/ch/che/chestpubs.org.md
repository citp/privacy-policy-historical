## **Personal Information**

**Collection**  
From General, Anonymous Users. When users browse this website without logging in through a personal or institutional subscription, they browse anonymously. Personally identifiable information--such as name, address, phone number, and e-mail address--is not collected or accessible. Aggregate data, such as the number of hits per page, is collected and used to measure and analyze traffic and performance of the offerings and features on the site.

From Registered Users and Subscribers. When a person becomes a registered user on this site, or chooses to interact with this site in other ways, such as purchasing a product, requesting e-mail alerts, or using the “Contact Us” form, certain personal information is collected. Credit card numbers are not stored in the system.

**Use**  
Information provided online is used to process, fulfill, and deliver requests for content and services. If a user has not opted-out of receiving marketing communications, their e-mail address may be used on occasion to alert them to new products or services that may be of interest. Users may opt-out of e-mail alerts at any time.

Deidentified aggregate usage information, which may include demographic data, may be reported to third parties, including our third-party vendors and advertisers.

**Sharing**  
Personally identifying information, such as names and contact information, of subscribers and site registrants is not shared or made available for purchase to outside organizations or companies. American College of Chest Physician member information may be available through the organization's membership list.

It may be necessary to share personal information with third-party companies with whom CHEST contracts to perform work related to the maintenance of the website, consulting, marketing, and other services, but such partners are prohibited from using the information provided for any other purpose.

The organization may disclose personally identifying information if required to do so by law or in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or legal process; (2) protect our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or the unauthorized use of our website; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public. 

**Retention**  
Personal information on customers is retained as dictated by business and legal requirements.
