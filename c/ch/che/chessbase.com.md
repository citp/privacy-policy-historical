Whenever you log into our website or leave a comment on it, the IP address of the computer you connected with is temporarily stored in a so-called logfile. The said data is then over-written with fresh data collected the next time you log in or leave a comment.

The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 (1) f) DGPR. Our legitimate interest follows from the fact that we are able to recognise any improper use and where appropriate prevent it. On no account will we make use of the data collected for the purpose of drawing conclusions about you as a person.

If you purchase goods or services on our internet site and in doing so leave your e-mail address this can subsequently be used by us in order to send a newsletter. In such a case we will send with the newsletter exclusively direct advertising for our own goods or services.

Number 5). These service providers are carefully selected and contracted by us; they are bound to our instructions and regularly vetted.

  1. **Cookies**



We employ cookies and similar technologies on our website. These are small files which are automatically created by your browser and which are stored on your device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.), whenever you visit our website. Cookies in no way damage your device, do not accept viruses, trojans or other malicious software.

The cookie stores information which is generated on each occasion linked to the device which is actually in use. This does not mean, however, that we receive from them any direct knowledge of your identity.

On one hand, employing cookies serves to make access to what we are offering more pleasant for you. Thus we install so-called session cookies in order to recognise that you have already visited individual pages on our website. These are automatically deleted when you leave our website.

Over and above that we also make use of temporary cookies in order to make things as user-friendly as possible; these are stored on your device for a pre-determined length of time. If you revisit our website in order to avail yourself of our services, it is automatically recognised that you have already been on the site and which inputs and settings you have used so that you do not have to enter them again.

On the other hand we employ cookies for a statistical analysis to evaluate the use of our website and for the purpose of optimising our offer to you (see Number 5).

Depending on their function and purpose cookies can basically be subdivided into three categories: technically necessary cookies, cookies for the purpose of analysis and cookies for marketing purposes.

**Technically necessary cookies**

What we are dealing with here are those cookies which are required for you to be able to navigate our website and to make use of the basic functions associated with the web page. This includes here, for example, possible access to secure areas of the website and the storing of preferences which allow us to make our services more quickly available to you whenever you re-visit our site.

The legal basis for the use of technically necessary cookies is Art. 6 (1) b/f) DGPR. This is because the cookies serve to offer you a service you wish to access on our website or to meet our legitimate interest.

**Analysis cookies**

These cookies allow us to establish how visitors interact with our website by collecting information, e.g. as to which preferences and search terms led to the website being accessed. This information is not matched to any other personal information we known about you. The analysis cookies serve to improve the user-friendliness of our website and consequently your experience as a user of it.

The legal basis for the use of analysis cookies is Art. 6 (1 a) DGPR. This is since the cookies are only used if you give your consent by means of an appropriate setting.

**Marketing cookies**

Marketing cookies are used to offer content which is relevant and appropriate to the interests of the user. In addition they are used to measure the effectiveness of and to guide advertising campaigns. They register whether a website has been visited or which content has been used.  This information can when appropriate be shared with third parties, e.g. advertisers. These cookies are often linked to the workings of third party sites.

The legal basis for the use of analysis cookies is Art. 6 (1 a) DGPR. This is since the cookies are only used if you give your consent by means of an appropriate setting.

Once you have given your permission for the use of analysis and marketing cookies, you can retract it at any future point and appropriate opportunities are available to you to change the settings. You can also configure your browser in such a way that no cookies are stored on your computer or that a warning is always given before a new cookie is saved. Complete deactivation of cookies, however, can lead to you not being able to use all the functions on our website.

  1. **Analysis by Google Analytics**



For the analysis of the usage of our website we make use of Google Analytics (from: Google Ireland Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland). Google analytics uses cookies to identify the frequency of use of specific areas of our website and preferences. In doing so Google Analytics conducts an analysis of usage across various devices which is made possible by the use of a specific user ID. This user ID allows them to classify the interaction data from a single user but derived from different devices and different sessions. This user ID is not linked to personal information concerning the user.

The information derived concerning the use of our website (including the shortened IP addresses of users) is transferred to and saved on a server belonging to Google. Google will use this information on our behalf and on the basis of an order processing contract in order to evaluate the use of our website, to prepare reports for us and provide other related services. Further information about data protection and security relating to Google Analytics can be found at [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en](about:blank).

  1. **Online Marketing**



Within the online shop on our website (for more details see under Number III) we also employ tools for the continual optimisation of our online marketing.

The legal basis for the use of relevant marketing cookies is Art. 6 (1) a) DGPR. This is since the cookies are only used if you give your consent by means of an appropriate setting.

  1. **Google Ads**



We employ the "Ads" procedure of Google in order to place adverts in Google’s advertising network in such a way that they are displayed to users who are potentially interested in our adverts. In this case when they are accessed on our and other websites on which Google’s advertising network is active, a code is executed by Google and so-called marketing tags (also known as web beacons) are attached. With their help, an individual cookie is stored on your device (instead of cookies alternative technologies can also be used). This notes which websites you have visited and which contents interested you or which pages you clicked on; furthermore technical information and other details are stored for further use. Moreover an individual “conversion cookie” is installed. The information obtained with the help of this is used by Google to establish conversion statistics for us. We only learn, however, the anonymous total number of users who have clicked on our advert and who have been transferred onwards to a page which has a marketing tag attached to it. The users‘ data are processed under a pseudonym within Google’s advertising network, unless they have chosen some other setting. The information collected is transmitted to Google and saved on their servers in the USA.

You will find further information as to the use of the data by Google and options regarding settings and objections as well as the settings for the display of adverts under  <https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads> or <https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated>.

  1. **Google Retargeting  **



We use Google’s retargeting technologies. This makes it possible to send to users of our website in a targeted fashion advertising linked to their interests such as they have already shown for our website and our products. The display of adverts follows on from a cookie-based analysis of the previous behaviour of the user, but no personal data is stored during this process. In the retargeting a cookie is installed on your device in order to collect anonymised data concerning your interests. This means that you are shown adverts which are most probably more related to the products which interest you. You can prevent the storing of cookies for the purpose of retargeting by installing the following plugin: <https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/>.

You can find further information about the data processing connected with retargeting by Google under <http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/>.

  1. **Google Tag Manager**



On our website we make use of the Google Tag Manager which makes it possible for us to be able to integrate into our website and to manage tracking cookies and code fragments (tags).

  * Google Tag Manager works without cookies and is a domain which simply brings about the triggering of other tags and does not itself access the data collected. So it basically comes down to a forwarding of data without the latter being stored or collected. Rather, the tag manager detects when an analysis tool wants to collect data and forwards it to the relevant program.



Further information about the Google Tag Manager can be found at https://www.google.com/intl/de/tagmanager/faq.html/http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy.

  1. **Bing Ads**



We employ the conversion and tracking tool “Bing Ads”. Bing Ads is provided by the Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA. In the context of Bing Ads cookies are stored on your device by Microsoft, in order to make possible an analysis of the use of our website insofar as you reached our website via Bing (“conversion tracking”). We (and Microsoft) can thus recognise whether you clicked on an advert which led you to our website or to a specific page you had in mind. With this we learn simply the total number of users who clicked on an advert and were then directed to our websiteYou will find further information about Microsoft’s data protection in the Microsoft data protection statement: <https://privacy.microsoft.com/de-de/privacystatement>.

  1. **Bing Ads Universal Event Tracking (UET)**



We use technologies from Microsoft with which, based on Microsoft‘s Bing adverts, data is collected and stored from which user profiles are created using pseudonyms. This makes it possible for us to follow your activities on our website if you came to it via Bing adverts. If you reach our website via a Bing advert a cookie is installed on your device. On our website a UET tag is integrated; this is a code, via which, together with the cookie, non-personal data about the use of the website is stored. The information collected is sent to the Microsoft server in the USA where it is stored basically for a maximum of 180 days. You can prevent the collection and processing of the data by deactivating the setting of cookies. In addition, under certain circumstances Microsoft can by means of so-called cross-device-tracking follow your use of the site on several of your devices, meaning that it is in a position to display adverts relevant to your interests on Microsoft websites.

You can find more information about the analysis services of Microsoft and about data protection in Microsoft and Bing under: <https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/de/53056/2> or <https://privacy.microsoft.com/de-de/privacystatement>.

  1. **Data security**



When you visit the website we make use of the common SSL process (Secure Socket Layer) in connection with the highest level of encoding which is supported by your browser. In general this involves a 256 Bit encoding. If your browser does not support 256 Bit encoding, we will instead revert to 128 Bit v3 technology.
