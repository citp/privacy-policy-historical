**Collection of Information**  
CheapCaribbean.com will sometimes ask for personal information such as your name, address, e-mail address, occupation, and other details. Providing us your information will simply help us offer products and services that we think you'd like to hear about.

**Personal Information Privacy**  
CheapCaribbean.com will take all appropriate steps to keep your personal information confidential. Those steps include limiting access to your information databases, communicating this policy statement to all CheapCaribbean.com employees and establishing and enforcing penalties for violating this statement.

CheapCaribbean.com will not sell, rent, or give away your personal information to other companies for them to use in selling others' products or services.

None of the people, who have made purchases through CheapCaribbean.com's web site using SSL, have reported fraudulent use of their credit card as a result of their online order. We believe SSL to be a very safe encryption method, but we are always looking for even more secure encryption methods to safeguard information sent online.
