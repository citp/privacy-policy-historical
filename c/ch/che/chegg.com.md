**Information Collection**

_Registration:_  
In order to become a Chegg user, you must first create an account on this web site. To create an account you are required to provide the following contact information: name, email address, major, current student status, graduation year, ZIP/postal code), and choose a password.

_Information about your Items:_  
In order to use Chegg, you may be entering items that you would like to sell. Any item information or personal comments are in the public/private section, however your profile information will only be provided as authorized by you in the private section of chegg.com. _ _

_Profile Information:_  
Once a user, you may provide additional information in the Profile section describing your contact information, privacy filters and student information. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and create a more trustworthy interaction with other students.

_Information about your Contacts_  
In order to invite others to connect with you directly in Chegg, you will enter their names and email addresses. This information will be used by Chegg to send your invitation including a message that you write. The names and email addresses of people that you invite will be used only to send your invitation and reminders.

You may also choose to manually enter or upload data about your contacts into the private “Peeps” section of our website. All information entered there will only be viewable by you and will not be searchable by others in the Chegg network without your permission.

All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this privacy policy as cover your own personally identifiable information.

_Cookies & Log Files:_  
Like most web sites, Chegg uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows Chegg to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.

One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you’ve logged in to your Chegg account. The next time you visit the Chegg web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to log in before using the service. Additionally, if you log out of the Chegg site you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. This cookie also functions as a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Chegg site. Session cookies sections expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.

Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Chegg web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave Chegg. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Chegg service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law.

_Web Beacons:_  
We allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Chegg public or private users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. Chegg may “target” some ads to users that fit a certain general profile — for example, “engineering students at  Stanford University .” Chegg does NOT use personally identifiable information to target ads.

To deliver these ads properly, Chegg may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by Chegg so the networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites.

Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. You will never see additional ads as a result of being a Chegg user and Chegg never provides personally identifiable information to any advertiser nor any third party.

_Children:_  
Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us or use the service.

**Information Use**

Chegg is an online service that provides local student classifieds and allows students on the same campus or cross-campus to interact with each other. The personally identifiable you choose to provide on this site is used to help you describe yourself to other users. Other information, that does not personally identify you as an individual, is collected by Chegg Inc., from the site (such as, by way of example, patterns of utilization) and is exclusively owned by Chegg. This information can be utilized by Chegg in such manner as Chegg, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.

_Chegg Communications:_  
Chegg will communicate with you through email and notices posted on this website. These include a series of up to three welcome emails which help inform new users about various features of the service. Please be aware that you will always receive certain emails from Chegg related to the proper functioning of your account, such as email notices when another user in your network sends you an opportunity. Chegg may send you promotional information unless you have opted out of receiving such information. If you wish to opt-out of receiving promotional emails, please send a request to [opt-out@chegg.com](mailto:opt-out@chegg.com).

_Customized Content:_

**Information Sharing**

_Sharing Information With Third Parties:_  
Chegg takes the privacy of our users very seriously. We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to any third parties for marketing purposes. We will only share your personally identifiable with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific services. For instance, we use a credit card processing company to bill users for subscription fees. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.

We may provide aggregated data about the usage of our services to third-parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate. We may segment our users by status(i.e. Freshmen, Sophomore, Juniors, Seniors, etc), major, geographic location, university. If you would like to be excluded from the aggregated research or products based upon aggregated data about our users’ activities on the site, please email customer service.

_Partnering with Other Organizations to Offer Combined Services:_  
Chegg may partner with other online services to give you the combined results of both services. Whenever we offer such combined services it will be your choice to make use of the combined services or not. In these cases, your personally identifiable information will only be passed from Chegg to the partner if you choose to use the combined service.

_Communications Between Users:_  
Many emails you initiate through Chegg, an invitation sent to a non-user for instance, will list your email address and name in the header of the message. Other communications that you initiate through the Chegg website, like a request for contact, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal contact information. Your contact information will only be shared with another user if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish contact with each other.

_Legal Disclaimer:_  
It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law. We will disclose such information wherein we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on our company or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

**Accessing and Changing Your Account Information**

You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired changes to the information, or to the settings for your Chegg account, at any time by logging in to your account on the Chegg website and editing the information on your Profile page. If you close your Chegg account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our publicly viewable data. We may retain certain data contributed by you if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law.
