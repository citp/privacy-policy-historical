Chegg is an online service that provides students the option to rent or buy their textbooks. Other information, that does not personally identify you as an individual, is collected by Chegg Inc., from the site (such as, by way of example, patterns of utilization) and is exclusively owned by Chegg. This information can be utilized by Chegg in such manner as Chegg, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. Chegg Inc. is the sole owner of any information collected on all Chegg Inc. Sites. Chegg Inc. collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site as described in the privacy policy. All private information collected is protected by Chegg Inc. 

**Cookies & Log Files **

Like most web sites, Chegg uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows Chegg to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site. 

One type of cookie, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you've logged in to your Chegg account. The next time you visit the Chegg web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to log in before using the service. Additionally, if you log out of the Chegg site you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. This cookie also functions as a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Chegg site. Session cookies sections expire after a short time or when you close your web browser. 

Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Chegg web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave Chegg. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Chegg service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law. 

**Web Beacons**

We employ as well as our affiliate program partner Commission Junction a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users for affiliate program. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user.s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers. personally identifiable information. This information is used to help improve the overall quality and experience of our website. To learn more about our advertising company.s use of clear gifs, please go to www.cj.com 

**Ad Networks**

We allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Chegg public or private users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. Chegg may "target" some ads to users that fit a certain general profile - for example, "engineering students at Stanford University." Chegg does NOT use personally identifiable information to target ads. 

To deliver these ads properly, Chegg may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by Chegg so the networks may provide anonymous, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites. 

Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. You will never see additional ads as a result of being a Chegg user and Chegg never provides personally identifiable information to any advertiser nor any third party. 

**Children**

Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us or use the service. 

**Information Sharing**

**Agents**

We may use an outside partner company for shipping and fulfilling orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. 

**Service Providers**

We use Paypal as a third party service to provide order transactions on our site. When you place an order on Chegg.com we will securely share your name and credit card with Paypal in order to collect payment and transact your order. If Chegg can not fulfill an order, we may use trusted third party partner merchant partners to source orders if necessary. Our trusted third party rental sourcing merchants receive customer shipping information, i.e. first and last name, shipping address, and phone number. This information is held strictly private between Chegg and the trusted sourcing merchant partner and is never shared with any other party. Chegg will deal with all customer inquiries and issues directly, regardless if we used a trusted third party merchant partner to source the order. We use third party software for the sole purpose of providing analytics and tracking to help improve our website. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. 

**Sharing Information with Third Parties**

Chegg takes the privacy of our users very seriously. We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to any third parties for marketing purposes. We will only share your personally identifiable with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific services. For instance, we use a credit card processing company to bill users for rental orders. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information. 

We may provide aggregated data about the usage of our services to third-parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate. We may segment our users by status (i.e. Freshmen, Sophomore, Juniors, Seniors, etc), major, geographic location, university for the purpose of improving our service. If you would like to be excluded from the aggregated research or products based upon aggregated data about our users' activities on the site, please email customer service at contact@chegg.com.

Whenever we offer such combined services it will be your choice to make use of the combined services or not. In these cases, your personally identifiable information will only be passed from Chegg to the partner if you choose to use the combined service. 

**Legal Disclaimer**

It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law. We will disclose such information wherein we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on our company or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
