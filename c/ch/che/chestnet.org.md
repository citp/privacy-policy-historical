# Privacy Policy | About - American College of Chest Physicians

### Data Privacy Policy

The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) is committed to protecting the privacy of its members and customers. CHEST maintains safeguards to store and secure information about all company and individual records in its possession. The safeguards may be physical, electronic, or procedural. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes: (i) how CHEST collects information from its websites and through other voluntary interactions with CHEST (e.g., subscription to a CHEST publication, purchase of a CHEST product, application for or renewal of CHEST membership, registration to a CHEST course or event, participation in a member survey, etc.); and (ii) how CHEST uses this information. With respect to websites, please note that this Policy applies only to CHEST’s websites and not to the websites of unrelated third-party companies or organizations to which CHEST provides links, or to any software that may be downloaded from CHEST’s websites.

By visiting CHEST’s websites, becoming a member or customer, or otherwise voluntarily submitting information to CHEST, you agree to this Policy. CHEST reserves the right to make changes to this Policy at any time; in such case, CHEST will post a notice that this Policy has been modified by revising the “Last Updated” date at the bottom of this page.

### What information does CHEST collect?

CHEST collects two types of information: (1) non-personally identifiable information for everyone who visits its websites; and (2) personally identifiable information for members, registered website users, and anyone who purchases products, events, and services, or requests information. 

### Non-personally identifiable information

CHEST collects non-personally identifiable information from users who are browsing the public areas of CHEST websites. Once a user submits personally identifiable information, subsequent visits to public areas of CHEST websites are no longer anonymous. When you visit any website, its server may generate a piece of text known as a “cookie” to place on your computer. The cookie allows the server to “remember” specific information about your visit while you are connected. The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of Web pages. CHEST employs cookies to collect information about all visitors to CHEST websites, including pages viewed and the order visited, terms used in searching CHEST websites, and products/events investigated or purchased. CHEST uses cookies to improve the website and to provide more personalized services both on this website and through other media, including helping determine which services are most important and to guide editorial and business decisions. Cookies from CHEST pages collect only information about your browser’s visit to the site. They do not collect personal information about you.

Users who do not desire the functionality offered by cookies may disable cookie functionality in their browsers or through settings on their mobile devices; however, users who do so may not be able to use some features of CHEST websites. For example, a registered user must have cookies enabled in order to access the registered-user sections of CHEST websites.

For system administration and troubleshooting, CHEST also logs the originating Internet Protocol (IP) address, the browser and operating system used, and information about individual use, such as time and date of visits, duration of sessions, and other similar usage or system data.

### Personally identifiable information

In addition to the non-personally identifiable information listed above, CHEST records the user’s name and member/customer ID number for all registered users (i.e., users who have logged into a password-protected area of a CHEST website). In the course of using CHEST websites, a user may be asked to provide personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, zip code, email address, telephone number, fax number, credit card payment information, etc.) in order to purchase a product or event, participate in a CHEST activity, subscribe to a journal, request information, or otherwise interact with CHEST. In addition, users may be asked to update their contact information.

CHEST also collects email addresses voluntarily provided via membership applications and renewals, course and event registrations, product purchases, member surveys, downloads of certain materials, email communication sign-ups, and comments made in discussion threads on CHEST websites.

_Important note for CHEST members and customers:_ CHEST also maintains a membership database. The information in this database (e.g., National Provider Identifier [NPI] numbers; demographic information, such as education and specialty) is drawn from membership applications, dues payment forms, subscriptions, product orders, continuing medical education (CME) reporting, public databases, member surveys, and other correspondence between CHEST and its members or customers.

_Credit card information:_ CHEST does not disclose the credit card account information or activity of its customers. When members and customers pay using credit cards, CHEST submits this information encrypted to obtain payment from the appropriate clearing house. Credit card numbers are never stored in CHEST databases. 

### How does CHEST use information collected?

CHEST uses the information it collects to better serve members, customers, and visitors to CHEST websites in the following ways:

### CHEST services and products

CHEST uses information collected to improve its web content, to respond to visitor needs and preferences, and to develop new products and services. For example, CHEST will combine non-personally identifiable information (e.g., data stored in cookies, user’s IP address) with personally identifiable information (e.g., user’s name, member/customer ID, email address) to offer products and services that may be of specific interest to the user.

### Disclosure to third parties 

CHEST may make your contact information and/or other personally identifiable information publicly available in connection with CHEST programs and events or for other purposes that might be of interest to you as a healthcare provider. 

CHEST also may disclose limited personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, email address, NPI number, transactional information, etc.) to outside service providers that help CHEST offer products, services, and information. For example, CHEST may work with outside service providers to: (i) distribute emails or make telephone solicitations; (ii) assist with direct marketing, customize journal advertisements, and collect data; (iii) help detect and prevent fraud; and (iv) otherwise assist CHEST in enhancing its products, services, and other offerings, and serving its members and customers. CHEST requires that these outside service providers agree to keep confidential all such information and to use it only for the purposes designated by CHEST.

CHEST may use outside marketing companies to place and monitor advertisements or links on CHEST websites and on other websites. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., links clicked on during a visit, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked on or scrolled over) and personally identifiable information (e.g., NPI number) during your visits to CHEST websites and other websites in order to provide advertisements about products and services more likely to be of interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or a third-party web beacon to collect this information. CHEST is not responsible for the collection or use of information by such marketing companies or third-party websites.

On occasion, CHEST also may provide personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, demographic information and email address) to third parties that offer their own products, or services deemed of potential interest to members and customers of CHEST and/or to the clinical or socioeconomic practice of medicine. Some of these products include:

  * Continuing medical education (CME) programs
  * Drug samples and pharmaceutical information
  * Medical equipment and supplies
  * Employment opportunities for health professionals
  * General practice-related commercial offers germane to the practice of medicine

  


### Protection of your data

CHEST has significant protections in place to ensure the privacy of your personal information. CHEST’s membership database is implemented and designed to protect your information. You will be asked to provide only the minimum information necessary when becoming a member, purchasing a product, or registering for a course or event. Multiple layers of physical, administrative, and electronic protections have been put in place to protect all information from unauthorized use, access, or malicious activity. Personnel procedures and processes have been developed with an emphasis on privacy.

The CHEST system is audited by independent third parties. Effective customer privacy and security are a top priority as part of our overall mission to provide our services to constituents.

### Emails

Once someone voluntarily provides an email address, CHEST uses that information to email that person with questions, transaction follow-up, promotions and communications. CHEST collects data to track the effectiveness of emails, which enables CHEST to better serve its audiences.

As noted earlier, there are instances in which CHEST will share email addresses of its members and customers with outside service providers who are under an obligation of confidentiality and restricted use. Release of email addresses is governed under strict contractual licensing guidelines and can only be used for specific purposes. 

All of CHEST’s marketing emails and those of third parties include a link for unsubscribing. CHEST will apply any unsubscribe request as quickly as possible. However, because there may be email campaigns already in progress, some messages may still be sent until the opt-out request can be fully processed. Once the opt-out is processed by CHEST and all of its partners that email address will no longer receive marketing or promotional emails from CHEST. Email addresses are still used in support of specific transactions (e.g., membership renewal notice, order confirmation).

### Opting out

Members, customers, and registered website users may choose not to have information released from CHEST. This is done by requesting that CHEST designate a record as “no contact”. The “no contact” status of a record ensures that information will not be licensed for purposes of marketing via email, mail or phone. To opt-out via “no contact” designation, please contact the CHEST Help Team at 800-343-2227 or via email at [HelpTeam@chestnet.org](mailto:HelpTeam@chestnet.org%3E?Subject=Privacy%20Policy)

### Market research opt-out

From time-to-time CHEST users may be invited to participate in surveys, focus groups and/or research panels. Participant contact information, including name, phone number, address and email address, may be used by CHEST to carry out the survey or communicate about the survey, focus groups and/or research panel and to provide incentives for participation. Participation in any type of research is completely voluntary. If you prefer not to be contacted to participate in future surveys, focus groups, panels, etc., please call the CHEST Help Team at 800-343-2227 or email the request to [HelpTeam@chestnet.org](mailto:HelpTeam@chestnet.org%3E?Subject=Privacy%20Policy)

CHEST may release personal information to third parties in order to comply with legal requirements.

### External relationships

CHEST has agreements with other organizations that offer products and services through CHEST websites or third party agreements. When the user interacts with these organizations on the organizations’ websites, whether as a result of following links from a CHEST website, within a CHEST email, or otherwise, different rules and privacy policies may apply. Since CHEST does not control the collection of information or the use of information collected via these other organizations’ websites, CHEST is not responsible for their privacy practices, security, or content.

For questions or concerns about this Policy, please contact the CHEST Help Team at 800-343-2227 or via email at [HelpTeam@chestnet.org](mailto:HelpTeam@chestnet.org%3E?Subject=Privacy%20Policy)
