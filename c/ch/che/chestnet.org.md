**Tracking Activity on Our Website**

When you view our website, we may store some information on your computer in the form of a "cookie." A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive, not on this website. Cookies do not spy on you, and they cannot invade your hard drive and steal information. Rather, they help you navigate a website as easily as possible. We use cookies to remember user names, identify user preferences, track click streams, and for load balancing. Because we use cookies, we can deliver faster service, updated results, and a more personalized site experience. You have the option of setting your browser to reject cookies. However, doing this likely will hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on this website. If cookies are not enabled on your browser, please adjust your security preferences to enable them, see the following link for simple instructions for several types of browsers: [www.google.com/support/](http://www.google.com/support/websearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35851)

**Collecting Personal Information**

_From General Users_ : When you browse our website and do not interact with the site for any service or product, you browse anonymously. Personally identifiable information--such as your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address--is not collected as you browse. We collect only aggregate data, such as the number of hits per page, and use this aggregate data only for internal and marketing purposes.

_From American College of Chest Physicians Members, Customers, Etc._ : When you become a registered user on this site, or choose to interact with this site in other ways, such as subscribing to CHEST publications, purchasing a product, applying for membership, participating in online surveys, submitting questions or comments, or requesting information or materials, we collect certain personal information from you. Depending on the product or service you request, we collect different types of personal information through online forms. Such information may include name, address, phone number, birth date, billing and delivery information, e-mail address, credit card information, and other demographic information. We never collect social security numbers, DEA numbers, or AMA numbers via our website. In addition, for some e-mails sent in HTML to members through our database mailings and electronic newsletters, we monitor whether a recipient subsequently clicks through to links provided in the message. We use this information only internally to enhance our products and the distribution of those products to our members.

**Using Personal Information:**

_Using Your e-Mail Address_ : We use e-mail to send materials advising of the availability and quality of products, programs, and other services and our supporting foundation, The CHEST Foundation. Such mailings might include, for example, newsletters and e-mails from program partners.

Member e-mail addresses are included in the online membership directory, which is accessible to every member. You might receive e-mails from other members regarding various matters, such as employment opportunities; we do not monitor or assume any responsibility for member-to-member e-mails. Nonmembers cannot access the online membership directory.

Except under special circumstances, as described below under “Sharing Personal Information,” we do not share, sell, trade, exchange, or rent your e-mail address to vendors or any other organization for them to market their products or services to you. When we hire vendors to deliver e-mails to you on our behalf, they are prohibited from using your e-mail address for any other purpose.

**Using Other Personal Information:**

We may use personal information (other than e-mail addresses) that we collect about you for the following internal purposes:

  * Register you for programs and services you have requested
  * Process, fulfill, and follow up on your orders or membership application
  * Answer your e-mails or online requests
  * Send information you request
  * Send and process surveys
  * Help ensure that our website is relevant to your needs
  * Deliver newsletters and notices of meetings or events
  * Notify you about new products/services, special offers, upgrades, and other related information from CHEST and The CHEST Foundation



**Sharing Personal Information**

We may share personal information with our business partners and other organizations, in order to provide them an opportunity to offer products or services that may be of interest to you. For example, we give exhibitors the names and mailing addresses of preregistrants to our annual CHEST meeting, and we sell the names and mailing addresses of subscribers to our _CHEST_ journal. In addition, when we determine, in good faith and using our best judgment, that an organization’s mission is so similar to, or aligned with, our mission that members could benefit from learning about that organization’s products or services, then we share member mailing addresses or e-mail addresses. We require these parties to use any personally identifiable information only to market and provide their products or services. And, except under special circumstances, we allow these parties to use such information only for a one-time mailing.

We also occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including, but not limited to, packaging, mailing, and delivering purchases; consulting services; data modeling, printing; and sending postal mail. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service. They are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

In addition, we may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on CHEST or The CHEST Foundation; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of CHEST or The CHEST Foundation; or (c) protect the personal safety of CHEST personnel, CHEST members, or members of the public in urgent circumstances.

**Opting Out**

_Opting Out of e-Mails_ : To opt out of our e-mail list, click the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the e-mail from us. You can also call CHEST Member Services at 800/343-2227 to opt out of all lists. Keep in mind that an opt-out request will be effective after a reasonable period of time for processing. In addition, keep in mind that e-members cannot opt out of e-mails and NetWork members cannot opt out of NetWork business e-mails, because these e-mails are the sole methods of communication.

_Opting Out of Postal Mailings_ : To opt out of postal mailings, send a written request to CHEST Member Services, 2595 Patriot Boulevard, Glenview, Illinois 60026.

_Opting Out of Online Membership Directory_ : There is currently no mechanism for members to opt out of inclusion in the online membership directory. However, members may limit the amount of personal information included in the directory. Contact our Membership Department for further information.

**Links to Third-Party Websites**

This website contains links to websites operated and maintained by third parties, and third-party websites might link to our website. We have no control over third-party sites or their content, and privacy policies on such linked sites may be different from our privacy policy. You access such linked sites at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a linked site before disclosing any personal information on such site.

**Surveys**

From time to time, we request information from users by way of surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary, and the user has a choice whether or not to disclose contact information and other demographic information.

**Correcting and Updating Information**

Members may update and correct any information we may have on file at any time. A review and update section function is included in the online membership directory on this website and can be reached through the "Member Resources" tab.

**Security**

We take precautions, including use of sophisticated encryption and authentication tools, to protect the security of personal information that you share with us. In addition, many areas of this website require the use of a user ID (or e-mail address) and password as an additional security measure that helps protect your information. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and your browser software might “cache” a page as you look at it, meaning that some pages are saved on your computer’s temporary memory even after you “log out” to end a secure session. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from this website, and you do so at your own risk.

**Retaining Personal Information**

We retain personal information regarding members indefinitely, and personal customer data for at least 7 years, as dictated by business and legal requirements.

**Credit Card Account Information**

We use credit card information provided to us, such as credit card numbers, only for billing purposes, to fill orders, to provide services, and for meeting(s) registration(s). For publication orders and for annual meeting(s) registration(s), this may involve providing your credit card number to our designated business partners, who also agree to only use your credit card number to process requested transactions.

**Children Under 13**

We do not knowingly solicit data online from, or market online, to children under the age of 13.

**_THIS PRIVACY POLICY MAY BE CHANGED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE._**
