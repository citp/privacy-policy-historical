## Chesterfield County, Virginia

## Website Privacy Policy

 **Modified September 6, 2018**

The following information explains the Internet Privacy Policy which Chesterfield County, Virginia has adopted for its chesterfield.gov Web site. The following is intended to explain our current Internet privacy practices but shall not be construed as a contractual promise. We reserve the right to amend our Internet Privacy Policy and Internet Privacy Policy Statement at any time without notice. 

 **The Privacy Act  **

We maintain our records in accordance with our obligations as defined by applicable Virginia statutes, including, but not limited to, the "THE GOVERNMENT DATA COLLECTION AND DISSEMINATION POLICIES ACT," the "Virginia Freedom of Information Act," and by any applicable U.S. Federal laws.

 **Links to Other Websites**

Because the county cannot control the sites to which we link, it cannot be held responsible for content included in them. Moreover, in no way should an external link be considered any form of endorsement by Chesterfield County.

Information contained on chesterfield.gov provides links that are maintained by other public and private organizations. Because the county cannot control or guarantee the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of sites to which it links, the county cannot be responsible for their content. Further, the inclusion of pointers to particular items in hypertext is not intended to reflect their importance, nor is it intended to endorse any views expressed or products or services offered by the author of the reference or the organization operating the server on which the reference is maintained.

 **Information Collected from the User Automatically**

The county may collect personally identifiable information that may be used by the county or a third party authorized by the county. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains how such information is collected and/or used. 

Through the use of the website, the county may collect the following information: 

  * The Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (or apparent IP address), Domain Name (or apparent Domain Name) of the Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) and/or the user’s computer. 
  * The type of browser and operating system used to access the Website; 
  * The date and time of each visit to the Website; 
  * The web pages and forms accessed during each visit; 
  * If the user connected to the Website indirectly, i.e., from an external website, the identity of the external website (if available). 



The primary purpose for the collection of this information is to facilitate operation of the website, ensure compatibility with various browsers and operating systems, and improve the Website and services when appropriate. The county uses Google Analytics to analyze data about the use of the site. 

Similarly, the county uses “cookies” on this website to better track how the site is being used. While cookies allow us to see which pages a user is visiting, they convey no personal information about the user. Disabling cookies in your web browser will not limit your experience or prevent you from viewing any content on this site.  

This information and data is not collected for commercial purposes, and the county does not sell or otherwise distribute for commercial purposes the information collected. The information may be distributed where required by Law. 

 **Information Submitted by the User**

There may be areas in the website through which the user may choose to submit personally identifying information (including, but not limited to, the user’s name, address, e-mail address, phone number(s), vehicle license plate number, date of birth, and credit card and/or bank account information). The county will treat and use this information as if the user disclosed personally the information during a visit to the county or a county department. In such cases, the county will use and/or disseminate such information as the county deems appropriate or as required by Law.  

Please be aware that the submission of information to the county by the user may cause such information to become public record, and if not otherwise protected by state and/or federal law, such records may be subject to public inspection, copying, reproduction and or public dissemination. 

 **Revisions**

The Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time without notice. You are encouraged to review the current Privacy Policy periodically, as your continued use of the Website constitutes acceptance.
