_Effective as of May 2018_

This policy describes Cheapflight’s practices regarding personally identifiable information and data ("personal information"). This policy applies to our websites, applications, email and text messages, and social media accounts (the "Platforms"). When you use the Platforms, you agree to the terms in this policy.

## The categories of Personal Information we collect

**Platform information:** When you visit the Platforms, we may collect information from you. Some of it may be personal information. This information can include search history, IP address, screen resolution, browser used, operating system and settings, access times and referring URL. If you are using a mobile device, we may also collect data that identifies your device, your settings and your location.

This information can include your name (and traveler’s if different) name, age, birthday, gender, passport number, redress control number, email address, telephone number, credit card information, billing address, itinerary and frequent flyer details. You can also choose to store personal information in your user account for future bookings.

 **Account information:** If you choose to register, we will collect your email address, password and home airport, and other preference information you provide us. If you choose a third-party service, like Facebook Login, to register or login, you are permitting us to use and store that information related to the account.

This can include the personal information that may be included in the confirmation emails you give us access to.

 **Promotional information:** If you choose to participate in a sweepstake, contests or similar campaign we will collect any information you provide in relation to such activity such as photos, images, captions or other content, in accordance with the terms provided at that time.

When you give us personal information, you are telling us that the information is true, accurate, complete and current. You are also telling us that you have the authorization to provide it to us.

## How we collect your Personal Information

 **Personal information you give to us:** We collect your personal information directly from you. For example, when you provide us your personal information when you register or book travel, contact our customer support or participate in a contest or sweepstake.

For example, we may help you find your closest hotel or send you messages that may be of interest to you based on your current location.

**Personal information we receive from third parties:** We collect your personal information from third parties. This can include when you log in using a third party platform, such as Facebook.

## How you can control tracking tools and opt-out of online behavioral advertising

Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How to do this varies from browser to browser. You should view the Help menu on the browser you use for further information. Your opt out choice is stored in opt out cookies only in that browser, so you should separately set your preferences for other browsers, computers, or devices you may use. If your browser blocks cookies, your opt out preferences may not be effective. Deleting browser cookies can remove your opt out preferences, so you should visit this page periodically to review your preferences. If you block or delete cookies or opt out of online behavioral advertising, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop.

Please also note that opting out of a third party cookie does not mean that you will no longer receive or be subject to online advertising or marketing. It means that the third party service from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and online behavioral. To opt out of having your online behavior tracked by Cheapflights for advertising purposes [click here](javascript:void\(0\);); this means that Cheapflights will no longer use information derived from your online behavior, collected by Cheapflights or third parties acting on behalf of Cheapflights, for the purpose of providing you interest-based advertising from Cheapflights only. Note that opting out of receiving interest-based advertising through the link above does not mean you will no longer receive advertising from Cheapflights or third parties at all; rather it means that most of the advertising that you will see will not be based on your particular interest. In addition, Cheapflights may still collect information for other purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.

We may also use Google Analytics to collect demographic and interest data about you (such as age, gender, and interests), including through Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.
