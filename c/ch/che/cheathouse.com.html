<h6 class="mt20 mb20">What Information Do We Collect?</h6>

<p>
    When visiting the our web site, you may provide us with two types of information:
    personal information you voluntarily choose to disclose that is collected on an
    individual basis, and Web site use information gathered on a collective basis as
    you and others browse our Web site.
</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information You Choose to Provide</strong></p>

<p><strong>Registration Information</strong></p>

<p>You will provide us information about yourself, your firm or company, and your
    practices when you register to be a user of our services, register for certain
    services, or register for email newsletters and alerts.</p>

<p><strong>Email Information</strong></p>

<p>If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of
    your email messages together with your email address and our responses. If you
    use our "Email this page" feature to send a copy of that page to someone else,
    your email address will appear as the sender of the email. Both your email
    address and the recipient's email address will not be used for any other
    purpose.
</p>


<h6 class="mt20 mb20">How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</h6>

<p>
    Generally, we use personal information for purposes of managing and expanding our
    business activities, providing customer service and making available other
    products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally,
    we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes
    to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will find
    valuable.</p>
<p>
    Choice/Opt-out</p>
<p>
    We allow you the choice to opt-out of having your information used for purposes
    not directly related to our site, when we ask for the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
    Until you explicitly opt-in for the first time we consider you in the opt-out
    category. We always notify our customers when their information is being
    collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed
    choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an
    outside party.</p>
<p>
    If you do not wish to receive any promotional or marketing e-mails and/or surface
    mail marketing letters, you may opt-out of receiving those communications by
    using the opt-out mechanism on the User Account Settings Web page, or by sending
    an e-mail with the subject line "Unsubscribe" to or e-mail address - see
    above.
</p>

<h6 class="mt20 mb20">What Are Cookies?</h6>

<p>
    A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique
    identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer
    for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically
    designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if
    your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser
    only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the
    cookies sent to you by other sites.
</p>

<h6 class="mt20 mb20">How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</h6>

<p>   
    As you visit our Web site, the site uses its cookies to differentiate you from
    other customers. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from seeing
    unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in more than is necessary for
    security.</p>
<p>
    Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate
    the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site
    are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve
    our Web site and better serve our customers. Cookies do not allow us to gather
    any personal information about you and we do not generally store any personal
    information that you provided to us in your cookies.
</p>

<h6 class="mt20 mb20">Sharing Information with Third Parties</h6>

<p>
    We may enter into alliances, partnerships or other business arrangements with
    third parties who may be given access to personal information including your
    name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing you
    information regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to
    you.</p>
<p>
    In connection with alliances, partnerships or arrangements, we may also provide
    certain information to third parties if we have determined that the information
    will be used in a responsible manner by a responsible third party.</p>
<p>
    We also use third parties to facilitate our business, including, but not limited
    to, sending email and processing credit card payments. In connection with these
    offerings and business operations, our partners and other third parties may have
    access to your personal information for use in connection with business
    activities.</p>
<p>
    As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings.
    Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred
    business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such
    information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or any
    dissolution.
</p>

<h6 class="mt20 mb20">How Do We Protect Your Information?</h6>

<p>
    Secure Information Transmissions</p><p>
    Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this reason, we
    request that you do not send private information to us by email. Some of the
    information you may enter on our Web site may be transmitted securely via Secure
    Sockets Layer SSL, 128 bit encryption services. Pages utilizing this technology
    will have URLs that start with HTTPS instead of HTTP. Please contact
    privacy@writework.com if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

<h6 class="mt20 mb20">How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</h6>

<p>
    You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we
    collect online and maintain in our database by contact us, see the above contact
    information.
</p>

<h6 class="mt20 mb20">What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</h6>

<p>
    We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from
    our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to
    other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may
    be useful to the users of our Web site. Please remember that when you use a link
    to go from our Web site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in
    effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including Web sites
    which have a link on our Web site, is subject to that Web site's own rules and
    policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>

<h6 class="mt20 mb20">Your Consent</h6>

<p>
    By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal
    information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we change our privacy
    policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our Web site to keep you
    aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances
    we may disclose it. At any time you may request to view any and all changes and
    updates, via surface mail.
</p>

<h6 class="mt20 mb20">Notification of Changes</h6>

<p>
    The Privacy Policy is subject to periodic review and change. In order to view the
    current Privacy Policy, simply check this section of the website. If we
    materially change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy
    statement and other places we deem appropriate so users are aware of what
    information we collect, how it is used, and under what circumstances, if any, we
    disclose it. In some cases where we post a notice, we may also email user who
    have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in
    our privacy practices.
</p>

<h6 class="mt20 mb20">Do you share visitor information with 3rd parties?</h6>

<p>
    The only information WriteWork.com may share with any 3rd party is general
    statistical information concerning the browsing patterns and target audience for
    specific pages of our site. We do NOT give out specific user information such as
    e-mails, names and addresses. In fact, we consider such information so precious,
    we are not willing to part with it for any cost.</p>
<p>
    We may from time to time annouce big changes or improvements on WriteWork.com
    via email. We know that some people get very annoyed with this, so it will always
    be possible opt-out of these info-mails. And no, we don't send mails to people
    who have nothing to do with our services.</p>
<p>
    You are our customers, and we value your loyalty - we will never wish you to be
    bothered by SPAM e-mail or any other kind of unsolicited e-mail potentially
    caused by sharing such information with a 3rd party.</p>
<p>
    As big supporters of OpenSource software (and frequent visitors to sites such as
    <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot.org</a>) you can easily imagine where
    we stand on this personally.
