# Security Details

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. The following measures are in place to protect customers from unauthorized use of their information. The online store uses SSL Encryption to scramble sensitive information (like bank account and credit card data) that is being sent back and forth from the CITM™ web server to the customer's web browser. Checks In The Mail is a secured facility and all phone calls, faxes, mail and e-mail are handled by authorized personnel. In addition, all computer systems are physically secured. 

  


**The Checks In The Mail** online store protects your transactions with the highest levels of security. Our servers use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced encryption technology that works with Netscape Navigator and Communicator (version 2.0 and above), Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 3.0 and above), and AOL (version 3.0 and above) browsers. SSL encrypts all of your personal information, including your account line specification, MICR line specification, or similar form of access number or access code for a credit card account, deposit account, transaction account or other nonpublic, private information , name, and address, so that it cannot be intercepted as the information travels over the Internet between your browser and our site. 

While we use Secure Socket Layer encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our user's information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our Billing department or a Customer Service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. 

Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

The VeriSign Secure Site service, is one of the most recognized symbols of trust on the Web, and offers our customers instant access to Checks In The Mail's security data. Verisign reports that it is virtually unheard of for someone's credit card info to be stolen via the Web and misused. And in the highly unlikely event that it is, the Fair Credit Billing Act protects e -shoppers against unauthorized use of credit information, limiting liability to only $50.

#### Test Our Secure Connection!

You can be sure that transactions are secured by looking for the following cues: 

  * The URL in the browser window displays "https" at the beginning, instead of http. 
  * In **Netscape Communicator** : The padlock in the lower left corner of the Navigator window will be closed instead of open. Netscape users can also follow these steps to see what level of encryption is protecting their transactions with your site: - Go to the Web site you want to check. - Click the Security button in the Navigator's toolbar. The Security Info dialog box indicates whether the Web site uses encryption. - If it does, click the Open Page Info button to display more information about the site's security features, including the type of encryption used. 
  * In **Internet Explorer: Microsoft Internet Explorer** tells users when encryption is in use by displaying a padlock icon in the bar at the bottom of the IE window. With IE, users can find out a Web site's encryption level: - Go to the Web site you want to check. - Right-click on the Web site's page and select Properties. - Click the Certificates button. - In the Fields box, select "Encryption type." The Details box shows you the level of encryption (40-bit or 128-bit).
