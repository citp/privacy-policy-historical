To further safeguard your most sensitive credit card information, we transfer such information across the Internet in an encrypted format and then store such information in our secure database.

As a member, your personal information is password-protected. If you ever forget your password, we will communicate that password to you only be sending an e-mail to the e-mail address stored in your account.
