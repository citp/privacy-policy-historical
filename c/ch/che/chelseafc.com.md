  * Other information necessary to provide the Chelsea FC Sites, for example we may access your location if you give us your consent.



We also receive Personal Information about you from third parties, such as information provided by:

  * third parties who sell match and event tickets for us, to let us know you’ve bought a ticket;

We may combine the information collected via the Chelsea FC Sites with information we collect from you offline, for the purposes of better understanding our customers and fans and to improve our marketing, as well as for security purposes.

 **3\. How do we use Personal Information?**

Depending on how you use the Chelsea FC Sites, your interactions with us, and the permissions you give us, the purposes for which we use your Personal Information include:

  * To fulfil your purchase, order or request (for example, when you buy a ticket or any merchandise through a Chelsea FC Site).
  * To maintain your profile on the Chelsea FC Sites and offer you a personalised experience on the Chelsea FC Sites. 
  * To administer ticket loyalty points, reward points and other loyalty schemes.
  * To manage and respond to any queries or complaints to our customer service team.
  * To improve and maintain the Chelsea FC Sites, and monitor their usage.
  * For market research, e.g. we may contact you for your opinions and comments.
  * To send you marketing messages and show you targeted advertising, where we have your consent or are otherwise permitted to do so.
  * For security purposes, to investigate fraud or abuse, and where necessary to protect ourselves and third parties.
  * To investigate breaches of our contracts, policies or Terms and Conditions.
  * To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.



We rely on the following legal bases, under data protection law, to process your Personal Information:  


  * Because the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you, or take steps prior to entering into a contract with you (e.g. where you have made a purchase with us, we use your Personal Information to process the payment and fulfil your order).
  * Because we have obtained your consent (e.g. where you contact us with a query, where you add optional information to your account profile, or if you consent to receive marketing from us). You are free to withdraw your consent at any time. 
  * Because it is in our legitimate interests in operating our business, for security purposes, to protect our staff, players, premises and reputation, for fraud prevention and to operate and promote the Club. For example, we are always seeking to engage more with our fans and users of the Chelsea FC Sites, and we use information about you to tailor your view of the Chelsea FC Sites (and the messages we send to you) to make them more relevant to you. We also combine information we collect about you with aggregated information about our fans, to increase our understanding of our fans and to promote the Club.



 **4\. How do we use your Personal Information for marketing & advertising?**

Depending on your marketing preferences, Chelsea FC, may use your Personal Information to send you marketing messages by email, phone, SMS or post. Some of these messages may be tailored to you, based on your online profile, your previous browsing or purchase activity, and other information we hold about you.

If you no longer want to receive marketing communications from us (or would like to opt back in!), you can change your preferences at any time by contacting us via any of the methods given at the in the ‘ **Contact us** ’ section at the end of this Policy, or by using the ‘unsubscribe’ mechanism in the promotional message or updating your contact preferences in your account. If you unsubscribe from marketing, please note we may still contact you with service messages from time to time (e.g. ticket confirmations, and information about your legal rights). Once you unsubscribe, you may continue to receive marketing messages for a few days while we action your unsubscribe request.

 _Social Media_

You may also see adverts for Chelsea FC on third party websites, including on social media. These ads may be tailored to you using cookies (which track your web activity, so enable us to serve ads to customers who have visited the Chelsea FC Sites). Where you see an ad on social media, this may be because we have engaged the social network to show adverts to our customers, or users who match the demographic profile of our customers. In some cases, this may involve sharing your email address with the social network. If you no longer want to see tailored ads you can change your cookie and privacy settings on your browser and these third party websites.

 **5\. Who do we share this Personal Information with?**

We share Personal Information with third parties in the following circumstances:

  * With the other companies in the Chelsea FC group, as necessary to operate our business as well as for marketing purposes to improve our customer insights.

 **6\. Chelsea FC Commercial Partners Programme**

We team up with a selection of carefully chosen commercial partners as part of our Commercial Partners programme. A list our current commercial partners can be found at [www.chelseafc.com/partners](http://www.chelseafc.com/en/about-chelsea/about-the-club/club-partners "club partners").

 **7\. Where is your Personal Information stored, and how long is it kept?**

Our servers are located in the United Kingdom. However, Chelsea FC uses service providers based around the world. Consequently, your Personal Information may be processed in countries outside of Europe, including in countries where the local laws do not provide the same level of data protection as those in Europe. If we transfer Personal Information outside the European Economic Area we will, as required by applicable law, ensure that your privacy rights are adequately protected by appropriate safeguards. These safeguards may include the EU’s standard contractual clauses or the EU-US Privacy Shield. Please contact us if you would like more information about these safeguards.  
We will keep your Personal Information for as long as we need it for the purposes set out above, and so this period will vary depending on your interactions with us and the nature of the Personal Information. For example, where you have bought a ticket or merchandise from us, we will keep a record of your purchase for the period necessary for invoicing, tax and warranty purposes. We may also keep a record of correspondence with you (for example if you have made a complaint) for as long as is necessary to protect us from a legal claim. Where we no longer have a need to keep your information, we delete or anonymise the relevant information. Please note that where you unsubscribe from our marketing communications, we will keep a record of your email address and/or phone number (as applicable) to ensure we do not send you marketing emails in future.

Our main website, [www.chelseafc.com](https://web.archive.org/chelseafc.com "chelseafc.com") is not intended for users under 13 years. users under 13 should instead visit bridgekids.chelseafc.com, our site designed especially for younger children. We recommend that parents supervise their children while they are online. There are various control tools available for online services that we advise parents to utilise in order to create a child-friendly online environment for their children.

We are dedicated to the protection of children's Personal Information and we do not actively market to children under the age of 13. We endeavour to limit the amount of Personal Information which we collect from users who are under 13.

Our Privacy Policy for younger users can be found on [www.chelseafc.com](https://web.archive.org/chelsea "chelseafc.com"). It supplements our main Privacy Policy, and we encourage parents and guardians of younger users to familiarise themselves with both notices.
