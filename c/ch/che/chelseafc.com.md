When You use the Chelsea Site or contact Us by post, telephone, fax, e-mail or SMS, or verbal communication, We may collect, store and use certain Personal Information that You disclose to Us. The Personal Information that We may collect from You includes, but is not limited to, Your first and last names, full postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, details of any purchases that You make through the Chelsea Site and Your credit or debit card details.   We may also collect details of Your computer's internet protocol address, which is automatically collected by Our web server.  We may supplement the Personal Information that You provide with other information that We obtain from Our other dealings with You or which We receive from other organisations, such as credit reference agencies (who are legally entitled to disclose that information).

By using the Chelsea Site or purchasing any products/services through the Chelsea Site, You agree that Your Personal Information may be recorded, used and protected by Us primarily for (but not limited to), any of the following purposes:

In order to provide Our products and services to You, We may need to appoint other carefully selected third party organisations to carry out some of the processing activities on Our behalf (e.g. delivery organisations and mailing houses).    In these circumstances, We will ensure that Your Personal Information is properly protected and is only used substantially in accordance with this Privacy Policy. ****

Please note that We will not sell, trade or otherwise transfer Your Personal Information to other unaffiliated third parties without Your approval. However, if You do not abide by the Terms and Conditions or post anything illegal onto the Chelsea Site, then we cannot guarantee anonymity. 

In order to provide You with the products and services You require, some of the organisations to which We may disclose Your Personal Information, are situated outside of the European Union. Some of these countries do not have laws that protect privacy rights as extensively as in the United Kingdom. If We do transfer Your Personal Information to other territories, We will take proper steps to ensure that Your Personal Information is protected substantially in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We team up with a selection of carefully chosen commercial partners such as (but not limited to) Our sponsors and finance participating organisations (" **Commercial Partners** ") as part of Our Commercial Partners Programme.  An up-to-date list of our Commercial Partners is available by contacting Us via the postal/email address given in paragraph 3 above.

Our Commercial Partners Programme is designed to support the Chelsea Companies and also to bring customers, fans and Chelsea Site users a diverse range of Our associated and branded offers at competitive prices.

We and/or these Commercial Partners may contact You in order to tell You more about the offers available to You and about a range of other initiatives.  Contact may be made in a number of ways, including by post, telephone, text/picture/video message, digital television, fax or by email.  If You express an interest in an offer from one of Our Commercial Partners, the Commercial Partner may let Us know. This enables Us to take Your views and interests into account when choosing Our Commercial Partners and developing the Commercial Partners Programme.

If You sign up to receive services from Us, including purchase of tickets or merchandise, or You enter any of Our promotions, You agree to Us and our Commercial Partners and selected third parties, where applicable contacting You to by post, fax, telephone, email or SMS to keep You informed of products, services, events and special offers which may be of interest to You. We will only keep you informed if you agree to Us doing so. If You prefer not to be contacted by Us or any of Our Commercial Partners or selected third parties, where applicable, You will have the opportunity to indicate whether You would like to opt out of receiving promotional and/or marketing information about products, services, events and offerings from Us and/or Our Commercial Partners and selected third parties. This can be done by clicking the relevant boxes on the screens on which You provide the information, or by contacting Us via any of the methods given in paragraph 3 above.  You can also change Your mind at any time by contacting Us via any of the methods given in paragraph 3.

## 19.1           Protection of Children's Personal Information

There are various control tools available for online services that we advise parents to utilise in order to create a child-friendly online environment for their children.  We are dedicated to the protection of children's Personal Information and We do not actively market to children.

## In order to protect children, those who are under the age of 18 must always ask their parent/guardian before they:

·         send any information to Us;

·         enter any competition or game that requires information about themselves/another child or offers a prize;

·         apply to join the Chelsea's Junior True Blues Team;

·         post any information on any bulletin board or enter any chat room; or

·         offer or agree to buy anything online.

## 19.3           Reviewing/Deleting Children's Personal Information

A parent/guardian may submit a request via email/in writing to the address set out in paragraph 3 above to stop any additional use of a child's Personal Information or to request that We delete the Personal Information.  Before disclosing information about a child, We may request that the parent/guardian provide reasonable information about the child for identification purposes (e.g. child's name, address, telephone number etc).
