# Cheat Code Central's Privacy Policy

Cheat Code Central: Privacy Policy 

Cheat Code Central respects your privacy and use of the web. 

Usage information may be analyzed in order to evaluate our system's performance. Your computer reaches us via a particular IP (Internet Protocol) address. This can reveal the identity of your Internet Service Provider, and their local point-of-presence. This data is compiled into statistics to show the server load and reveal peak usage. None of this information is sold or disseminated to outside parties. 

The individual web pages from Cheat Code Central that are requested by your browser are recorded in a server log to allow evaluation of our most popular pages, and to reveal the presence of broken links and other request problems. None of this information is sold or disseminated to outside parties. 

Your browser has the ability to use "cookies" which, unless you disable their use, store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to various web sites. When you register for a Cheat Code Central e-mail address, cookies are used to store your login status and preferences. They also are used to limit the number and frequency of various ads displayed as you browse the site. Banner, tower, and other ads displayed through our advertising broker may elect to use cookies to prevent the same ad being displayed too many times to the same user, or to identify Cheat Code Central as the site responsible for a "click-through" for an advertiser. However, cookies can not reveal any personal information about you. None of this information is available to Cheat Code Central, and therefore is not sold or disseminated to outside parties. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you on this site, other web sites, and other forms of media. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp) and [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp).
