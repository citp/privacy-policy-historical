We collect this information as it allows us to monitor how effective our website is and how easily it is for you to get around. We also use Cookies, which are little bits of code that attach to your web browser and again help us to see how the site is working. You can read more about cookies and how to manage them [here](https://www.checkatrade.com/About/Cookies.aspx). 

We monitor calls made to Traders via Checkatrade.com so that we can better understand the service provided by our members. If you call a Trader using a telephone number listed on our website we will store a record of your telephone number and we may contact you for market research purposes and to find out more about your experience with our members. 

When you use a Checkatrade member they will provide you with a feedback form to fill in and return to us.

In order to validate feedback we ask you for the following personal information: 

    * Name
    * Address
    * Telephone number
    * Email address
    * Signature

We will only ever use your personal information to contact you about your review and to make sure it is genuine. If you have given your consent, we will also use your details to tell you about other products and services that we think may be of interest to you. We will never sell or share your details with third parties for marketing purposes. 

If you are happy to provide feedback on the work that has been carried out we will publish your review on the website although we will never display your full details and you can request to have your review removed at any time. 

Any feedback submitted to us will be provided to the relevant member if they request it and they can use it on other platforms or marketing materials which are not owned or controlled by Checkatrade. We will only ever share your feedback, not your personal details. 

  * ## Using information provided by third parties

We use data from third parties and publicly available sources such as Companies House, Experian, the edited electoral roll or the deceased preference service. Using this data helps us to ensure that our records are accurate and up to date by filling in any gaps on an address or clarifying vanity addresses and house numbers. It also allows us to remove anyone from our mailings that has passed away. 

We also use data for marketing purposes. Any data we use in this way is thoroughly checked by both the supplier and our own internal teams to ensure that the correct marketing permissions are in place and that the data is being used fairly. 

  * ## Keeping and storing your data

If you’re a current or past member, we’ll keep a copy of your personal details for no longer than 6 years, from the time your active membership with us ends. Holding on to data allows us to keep accurate records for tax purposes and to handle any future complaints. 

If you have submitted feedback on a member, we will keep a record of your personal information for as long as the review remains on the website. Keeping a record of all reviews allows us to monitor feedback and combat fraudulent activity. 

Some of the data that we collect may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area ('EEA'). We take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable privacy laws. 

  * ## Sharing your data with third parties

We respect your privacy and that’s why we don’t share or sell your data to any third parties. However, on occasion and in addition to the above, we will pass your information to a limited number of third parties for the following reasons: 

    * To enable carefully selected partners to provide you with member benefits such as discounted rates on materials, vehicles or tools and Public Liability Insurance
    * To allow us to carry out certain background checks including sharing data with local Trading Standards offices
    * To deliver the services you’ve asked for including passing details to payment providers
    * For legal or regulatory purposes including fraud prevention
    * If we buy or sell any business or company assets

  * ## We’ll always keep you in the loop

Whenever we collect your personal information we’ll give you the opportunity to let us know how you’d like us to get in touch in the future. We promise not to inundate you with marketing messages but we also understand if you’d prefer not to receive anything from us. 

If you’ve asked us to send you marketing material, you can change your mind at any time by contacting us using the details in the Contact Us section. You’ll also find an unsubscribe link at the bottom of every marketing email we send to you. 

### Service messages

If you’re a member and you’ve given us an email address you may receive messages related to the management of your membership, which include payment and renewal documents. If you’d prefer not to receive these messages in this way, just let us know and we’ll be happy to provide them in paper form instead.
