                If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update
                your personal information online by logging into <a href="/myaccount/myaccount.aspx">
                    your account</a> and clicking on your account settings. More information about
                how to contact us is provided below. If you have an online account with us, you
                also may close your account at any time by visiting the “Account Settings” page
                for your account. After you close your account, you will not be able to sign in
                to our website or access any of your personal information. However, you can open
                a new, separate account at any time or re-activate your previous account by following
                instructions we will give you at the time you close your account. If you close your
                account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for
                analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect
                any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary
                to protect the integrity of our website or our users, or take other actions otherwise
                permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided
                to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information
                will be subject to those third parties' policies.</p>

                    of transactional and relationship email communications, such as service announcements,

            <p>
                We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural
                measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and
                disclosure. We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business.
                However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to
                secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your
                personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.
                Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information
                and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer
                to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information

                postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject
                of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on
                publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can
                be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you
                may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what
                other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you

                technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact
                with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any personal information

                who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver
                (such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements
                clicked or scrolled over, etc.), and possibly associate this information with your
                subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this information
                with personal information they collect from you to provide advertisements about
                goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. The collection and use
