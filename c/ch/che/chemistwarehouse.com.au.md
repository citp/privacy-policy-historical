**What is Chemist Warehouse's Privacy Statement?**  
Our web server makes a record of your visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes - the user's server address, the user's top level domain name (eg. .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc.), the date and time of the visit to the site, the pages accessed and documents downloaded, the referring site and the type of browser used. No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the web server's logs.

 **What do we do with the data collected in our privacy statement?**  
Chemist Warehouse uses this information to improve our services and capabilities in operating our business for the consumer. We do not sell, provide, or allow our information to be viewed by any other person other than those employed by Chemist Warehouse.

 **Why do we collect email addresses?**  
Chemist Warehouse requires email addresses for correspondence in regard to orders placed and registration of users. We do not use these emails for commercial use without prior consent.

 **Why do we require Patient Profiles to be entered on particular products?**  
Patient profiles are required for particular products to ensure that these products will not cause any potential interactions with other drugs, allergies or health conditions that the patient may currently take or have. The information is not supplied to any other party. Patient Profiles are not required for products that we deem do not have a potential for these types of interactions.

 **How can Chemist Warehouse customers ensure the accuracy of data quality and security in regard to their personal information?**  
The customers enter all information collected and stored on Chemist Warehouse customers. Registered customers can view and alter this information by logging in with their username and password and accessing their account information. The information includes patient profiles, addresses, and past orders. Access to this information by Chemist Warehouse staff can only be performed by staff members with a secure password, with access only performed when required. Access to this information is recorded by log files to track unauthorised access and modifications.

 **Can Chemist Warehouse customers order with anonymity?**  
As Chemist Warehouse requires a physical address to deliver parcels to and a signature on delivery, anonymity cannot be assured.

 **How can Chemist Warehouse customers' information be removed from our database?**  
If at any stage an Chemist Warehouse customer would like their information removed from our database, we require an email with the username, password and identifying information and the patients file will be deleted from our records. Please send to:
