<div class="mainbody_wide"><p>This page outlines how Cheat Happens (https://www.cheathappens.com) complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as well as its Privacy Policies. Cheat Happens is classified as a "data controller" under the GDPR. If you have any questions regarding this information, please contact Chris O'Rorke (see: <a href="aboutus.asp">About Us</a>).</p>
<p>LAST REVISION: DEC 28, 2018
</p><p class="header16 openbold"><u>CHEAT HAPPENS WEBSITE</u>:</p>
<p class="header16 openbold">Personal Information Collection and Use</p>
<p>Cheat Happens is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Cheat Happens collects information from our users at several different points on our website. Third parties that advertise through our website may also collect information through cookies and you may find their privacy policy at the corresponding advertiser's website. Our primary advertiser is Yieldlove and you can find their privacy policy here: <a href="yieldlove.asp">https://www.cheathappens.com/yieldlove.asp</a>. Users may opt-out of the cookies and data being collected by all third parties at any time (see bottom of page).</p>
<p>Cheat Happens offers memberships which include both free and paid levels. We only require and store User Alias, E-Mail Address, Password, Security Question and Answer and IP address(es). We do not ask for or store other personally identifiable information such as Real Name, Date of Birth, Social Security Number or any kind of Financial Data. All financial data is processed securely via either PayPal (<a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full">PayPal Privacy Policy</a>) or Authorize.net (<a href="https://www.authorize.net/company/privacy/">Authorize.net Privacy Policy</a>).
</p><p class="header16 openbold">Site Security</p>
<p>Cheat Happens operates only using SSL for all pages served through our site. All data is stored securely behind 3 independent firewalls in an effort to secure all data, personal or otherwise. Cheat Happens utilizes services by Cloudflare to help increase security, improve the performance of our our site and protect against DDoS and other attacks. Under the GDPR, Cloudflare acts as a "data processor" and we have a signed Data Processing Addendum (DPA) on file. You can view Cloudflare's privacy policy here: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy/">https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy/</a>.</p>
<p class="header16 openbold">Third Party Advertisers</p>
We work with third-party companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our website in order to provide advertisements on this website, other websites and other forms of media about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.
<p class="header16 openbold">Cookies</p>

Cheat Happens uses cookies to enhance the user's experience, often allowing a user to browse the site more quickly. Some cookies are necessary for the website to function, especially those used when signed in as a registered user. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). Additional cookies may include those used for gathering site statictics and analytics, user preferences and marketing. Under the GDPR, users may opt in or out of all cookies not deemed necessary. All visitors will be prompted to either allow or decline these cookies upon first visiting our site and then may change their previous choices at any time (see bottom of page). </p>
<p class="header16 openbold">Log Files and IPs</p>
<p>IP addressess are logged in the server's log file which is used for administering the site. Log files contain no personally identifiable information. Under very rare circumstances, log files may be furnished to 3rd party advertisers for proof of traffic information. IPs are also stored within our message board area and are used to ban those users that do not comply with our message board rules. IPs are also documented upon user registration, login, when downloading files and during our trainer authentication process (more on this below). </p>
<p class="header16 openbold">Google Analytics</p>
<p>Cheat Happens utilizes Google Analytics to gather information on our visitors and track certain site stats and metrics. IP anonymization is automatically enabled for all data collected by Google Analytics. </p>

<p class="header16 openbold"><u>CHEAT HAPPENS APPLICATIONS</u>:</p>
<p class="header16 openbold">Cheat Happens Personalized Trainers</p>
<p>In an effort to maintain the integrity of the files downloaded from our site and to prevent
illegal file sharing, our personalized trainers will perform an authenticity check while in use. This check
requires an internet connection and the trainer will not run if a connection is absent or if the
trainer is blocked by a security application. The only information sent to Cheat Happens during this process is a uniquely generated string that can only be used to identify the member for which the trainer was personalized. This information is useless outside of the Cheat Happens website as it does not correlate to any personally identifiable information. As a part of routine website logging, the originating IP address may also be collected. This check is only performed on trainers that have been
personalized for individual use, not our PROMO or FREE trainers. If you want/need to use the
trainer offline, please go to our <a href="https://www.cheathappens.com/trainer_troubleshooting.asp">trainer troubleshooting page</a> for instructions on how to obtain
an offline key to avoid online checks. Some trainers may collect and show debug information which may contain some personally identifiable information in plain text. This information is not automatically sent to the Cheat Happens website. It is up to the end user to submit this information in order to help with troubleshooting trainer functionality. Some trainers may also feature a report function allowing users to send feedback to Cheat Happens. This feature may contain email address or other personally identifiable information but is optional. </p>
<p class="header16 openbold">Cheat Happens is a Software as a Service Company</p>
<p>Cheat Happens offers two different types of personalized software downloads, those that are purchased individually and those that are downloaded via a membership. Beginning on January 1, 2019, an active (non-expired) membership will be required for personalized trainers to continue to function. The only exceptions to this are those trainers that were purchased individually and/or those people that are eligible to download an offline key. Once a membership expires, all trainers will become disabled and will be unable to authenticate online until the membership is renewed or brought back to active status. Once that happens, previously banned trainers will work again. </p>
<p class="header16 openbold">Cheat Happens Offline Key Tool</p>
<p>This tool may be downloaded from our <a href="https://www.cheathappens.com/trainer_troubleshooting.asp">trainer troubleshooting page</a> in order to generate an offline key that can be used to authenticate personalized trainers in an offline situation. This tool collects hardware specific information about the user's computer which is then used to generate a unique string of characters that correlates to a Cheat Happens user account. No personally identifiable information is included in the data obtain or sent back to Cheat Happens by this tool.</p>
<p class="header16 openbold">Cheat Happens Trainer Manager</p>
<p>This tool consists of two parts. One is a built-in web browser in which everything listed above under "CHEAT HAPPENS WEBSITE" applies. The second part is a compilation of personalized trainers located on the user's computer. If selected by the user, the application can check for new versions of trainers as well as the trainer manager application by making a simple request to the Cheat Happens website containing only information about the trainer and/or application, not the user. As a part of routine website logging, the originating IP address may be collected.</p>
<p class="header16 openbold">Cheat Happens CoSMOS</p>
<p>This tool performs a routine check to see if a new version is available. No personal information is sent during this process. As a part of routine website logging, the originating IP address may be collected. A feedback as well as crash log routine is included in which users may choose to send this data to Cheat Happens. This may contain email address or other personally identifiable information but is optional.</p>
<p class="header16 openbold"><u>CHEAT HAPPENS COOKIE DECLARATION</u>:</p>
<strong>NOTE</strong>: If you are not seeing our cookie declaration then it means that your IP address has been identified as outside of the EU and does not require consent as a part of the GDPR.
