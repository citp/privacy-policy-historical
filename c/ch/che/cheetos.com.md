CHILDREN’S PRIVACY POLICY

**

Frito-Lay, Inc. ("Frito-Lay") recognizes its obligation to adhere to the highest standards of integrity for its online visitors. We have developed certain privacy practices in order to maintain these standards and to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Practices Act ("COPPA") and the guidelines established by the Children's Advertising Review Unit of the Better Business Bureau ("CARU"). On ePLOIDS.com™ and the related Frito-Lay web sites, we are dedicated to providing kids of all ages with a safe and secure place to have fun online. **If you have any questions or comments about this site, or the privacy policy, you should contact Frito-Lay Consumer Affairs at Box 35645, Dallas, Texas 75235-0645 or call 1-800-352-4477 weekdays between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. CST. You may also send an email to**[ webmaster@eploids.com](mailto:webmaster@eploids.com) **.**

 ****

Frito-Lay only collects personal information from online visitors on a voluntary basis. We do not require personal information to visit ePLOIDS.com™ or our other web sites; however, we do require some information for visitors to sign up to participate in our ePLOIDS auctions or to register for specific promotions. **As required by COPPA, Frito-Lay will not require visitors to give more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity.**

 ****

When children register for the ePLOIDS auctions, first we ask them to tell their parents that they want to sign up. On the ePLOIDS auction sign up page, we ask for (1) an anonymous (made up) ePLOIDS screen name; (2) an anonymous (made up) password; (3) the parent’s or visitor’s e-mail address; (4) the visitor’s birth date; (5) the visitor’s zip code; and (6) the visitor’s gender. On any Frito-Lay promotion registration page, we will request the visitor’s date of birth and an e-mail address for the registrant or his/her parent. **If a child under 13 signs up to participate in our ePLOIDS auctions, or registers for a promotion, we will send the parent an e-mail to verify consent to the child’s registration and participation, and we will send a confirmatory email to the parent after the parent consents to the registration.**

Frito-Lay will use information submitted on the sign up pages to keep track of visitors’ participation in the auctions or promotions, to respond to comments or questions, to notify a visitor if he or she is the highest bidder in an auction or the winner of a promotion, to send visitors special messages regarding the site, to provide visitors with access to special areas or features of the site, and for internal purposes. If Frito-Lay requires the full name, address or additional personal information of a child to fulfill a winning auction bid or award a promotional prize, we will obtain that information from the parent or guardian offline (generally by using a downloadable form to be completed and signed by the parent or guardian and mailed back to us). 

Frito-Lay will never sell, rent, individually post online or otherwise disclose any personal information about our visitors to third parties for marketing purposes. Sometimes, we hire trusted companies to help us with our web sites, and those companies may have limited access to personal information for the sole purpose of performing their services, subject to confidentiality obligations. Frito-Lay may collect non-personal information from our online visitors (such as the visitor’s type of browser, operating system and domain names), but we do not collect personal information in this process. The non-personal information we collect enables us to track the total number of visitors to each of our sites in an aggregate form, and is used by Frito-Lay to improve and update our sites, products and services. Aggregate (non-personal) information may be shared with 3rd parties. Although "cookies" (special codes deposited on our users’ hard drives) may be placed on visitors’ computers, we do not use cookie technology to track personal information from or about our visitors. 

****

**COPPA requires that parents be allowed to review their child’s personal information, have it deleted and refuse to allow further collection or use of that personal information.** On eploids.com™, parents will have the opportunity to review and either accept or deny a child’s registration at the time we notify them that the child has signed up to participate in ePLOIDS auctions or a particular promotion. The child and/or the parent may cancel the child’s registration at any time by sending an email to [webmaster@eploids.com](mailto:webmaster@eploids.com)identifying the screen name, password and/or email address to be removed. Once the registration is canceled or withdrawn, we will delete the child’s personal information and the child will not be eligible to participate in ePLOIDS auctions or receive a promotional prize from our site. A visitor may be allowed to re-register; however, parental consent will be required each time a child signs up. 

If visitors send us any comments, suggestions, information, ideas, concepts, knowledge or techniques, Frito-Lay is free to use the information worldwide, in perpetuity, without acknowledgement or compensation, for any purpose, including developing, manufacturing or marketing products and/or modifying or improving our web site(s).
