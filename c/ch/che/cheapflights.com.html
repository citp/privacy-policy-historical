<li><strong>Other information you may provide</strong> (including other information you provide about yourself or others through our Services or to which you provide us with access via third-party platforms)</li>
</ul>
<p><br>You may choose not to provide some of the personal information described above. Please note, however, that many of our Services require some personal information to operate, so if you choose not to provide the personal information necessary to operate and provide you with a particular Service or feature of that Service, you may not be able to use that Service or feature.</p>
<p>We do not proactively collect sensitive personal information, such as health-related information. However, our Services include text boxes that are designed for you to describe certain details about your travel preferences or special requests that you want us or our travel partners to know. Please be aware that information you freely submit in these boxes may reveal to us or to the travel partners or third parties with whom we share information (as detailed in the <a class="_hB3" href="#shareinfo">How We Share Your Information</a> section below) certain information that may be considered sensitive personal information under applicable law (for example, information about dietary restrictions or disability accommodations). Sensitive personal information you voluntarily submit is processed on the basis of your consent, which you may revoke at any time by contacting us at the details set out in the <a class="_hB3" href="#contactus">How to Contact Us</a> section below.</p>
<p>Personal Information Generated By Us. As you use our Services, we generate certain personal information about you, including through automatic data collection and by inferences based on the information we collect about you and your activity. We may automatically collect information about your interactions with the Services or communications you receive (such as email) using certain technologies, such as cookies, web beacons and other technologies (see our <a class="_hB3" href="#trackingtools">Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising Policy</a> for more details). We generate the following categories of personal information about you:</p>
<ul class="_kP _bGK">
<li><strong>Device information.</strong> When you visit or use our Services, we automatically collect certain information about your device (e.g., your mobile device, computer, or tablet), including information about your hardware and software, device configuration, and nearby networks. Such data may include data about your device operating systems, browsers, and other software installed on your device; such as IP address or other device identifier; country of origin, region and language settings; and information about domain servers and wireless or network access points near your device.</li>
<li><strong>Usage and performance information.</strong> We also automatically collect personal information about your usage of the Services, including information about your searches, statistics about the travel itineraries you share with us, how you interact with the features of our Services and the links you click, your preferences, access times, referring URL, and performance of our Services.</li>
<li><strong>Location information.</strong> If you use our Services, we automatically collect approximate location information about you (such as your city) or, with your consent, precise geographic location data from your mobile device when the app is running and when it is not running, depending on the choices you make when you are asked to consent to our collection of location information. The technologies we use to determine your location may include IP address mapping, cell tower position, Wi-Fi position and GPS signals. We may use and store this information to provide and improve features of our Services, for example, to tailor our Services on a needs-based manner to better facilitate your requests (such as helping you find the hotel closest to you) and to provide you with more relevant content in the cities you visit (such as sending you marketing communications relating to goods or services in your current city, including local accommodations and travel options). KAYAK does not have control over your device settings, but we do recommend enabling location services on your device so you can take advantage of the location-based features and functionality offered. Please see the <a class="_hB3" href="#choicesandrights">Your Rights and Choices</a> section below for more information about how to adjust your preferences, including those related to location information.</li>
<li><strong>Inferences about you.</strong> We combine the information we collect, generate, or otherwise obtain to draw inferences about your preferences and interests in order to provide and personalize our Services and tailor the advertising we and our partners display or offer to you.</li>
<li><strong>Emails you synchronize with your Trips account.</strong> If you sign up to synchronize your email inbox to your Trips account, you authorize us to access the emails in the email accounts you have connected to your Trips account in order to create travel itineraries. This involves automatically scanning your inbox at regular intervals to identify emails that are booking confirmations, which are then parsed automatically or manually for relevant travel details and imported into our Trips service (along with a copy of the email, which is saved to your Trips account). See the Trips Services section below for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>Personal Information We Obtain from Third Parties.</strong> We may also receive certain categories of personal information from third parties, such as third-party websites, applications, social media networks, and services (each, a <strong>“third-party platform”</strong>), our group companies, travel partners, and other third parties, including individuals who have shared their travel itineraries with you through our Trips service. If you are an existing KAYAK user, we will combine this information with information we collect through our Services and use and share it for the purposes described below. The categories of personal information we may obtain from third parties includes:</p>
<ul class="_kP _bGK">
<li><strong>Your name</strong></li>
<li><strong>Email address or other contact information</strong></li>

<li><strong>Browsing, purchase, usage and advertising details</strong>, including information about restaurant or travel accommodations and bookings you make through our group companies and travel partners (for example, if you book a flight through one of our group companies, we or our travel partners may receive the general location of your destination and use that information to provide recommendations for hotels or other accommodations or complementary services); how you use third-party websites, applications, and services; information relating to your interactions with our advertising and marketing materials; and demographic information about users of our Services.</li>

HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION </h3>
<p>We use your personal information for the following purposes (<strong>“Purposes”</strong>), to:</p>
<ul class="_kP _bGK">
<li><strong>Provide the Services</strong>, which includes providing you with the services, products, and functionality offered through our Services and fulfilling your requests, including, but not limited to: facilitating and processing bookings with our travel partners, reviewing travel partners, paying for travel partners’ products and services through our Services, and notifying people you add to, or otherwise request to notify of, your bookings through the Services</li>

<li><strong>Authenticate your account credentials and identify you</strong>, as necessary to log you in to the Services and ensure the security of your account</li>
<li><strong>Show your reservations and bookings</strong> made through the websites, applications, and services of our group companies, such as Booking.com or OpenTable, on your account page</li>
<li><strong>Communicate with you</strong> about your account or use of our Services, products, and/or functionality (e.g., soliciting reviews and feedback, sending alerts and notifications you have subscribed to, providing updates regarding itineraries processed by our Trips service, sending you booking confirmations, sending you information servicing and administrative emails or other notices required by law); respond to, or follow up on, your comments and questions; and otherwise provide customer service (see below for more detail on <a class="_hB3" href="#ecommunications">Electronic Communications</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Send you marketing communications</strong>, including communicating with you about services or products offered by KAYAK, our group companies, or our business partners and other marketing communications that we believe you would be interested in, as permitted by law (see below for more detail on <a class="_hB3" href="#ecommunications">Electronic Communications</a> and <a class="_hB3" href="#choicesandrights">Your Choices and Rights</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Operate and improve our Services and develop new products and services</strong>, including using analytics to better understand how you use our Services for purposes of product, website, application and service development and to enhance the user experience</li>
<li><strong>Process and deliver contest entries and rewards</strong></li>
<li><strong>Process your payment information</strong></li>
<li><strong>Provide services and information to travel partners</strong>, such as providing user feedback and usage details</li>
<li><strong>Tailor your experience with our Services</strong>, such as by making inferences or combining different pieces of information we have collected about you to offer better search results or otherwise tailor our Services to you according to your preferences or restrictions. For example, if you frequently book rooms at four-star hotels and rent cars when you travel, we may prioritize four-star hotels in your search results or bring you a combined package offer for hotel and car, or prioritize accommodations you have previously booked</li>
<li><strong>Provide you more relevant advertising on and off our Services</strong>, including to show you personalized offers and advertising on and off our Services. For example, if you tend to book rooms at four-star hotels and often travel to Tokyo, we may display advertising for a four-star Tokyo hotel to you on our Services or work with our travel partners and advertising partners to display advertisements for four-star Tokyo hotels to you on other websites you visit.</li>
<li><strong>Protect against, investigate, and deter fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Comply with our policies, procedures and legal obligations</strong>, including complying with law enforcement or government authority requests, addressing litigation-related issues, and exercising rights or obligations conferred by law</li>
<li><strong>As otherwise consented to by you and as required or permitted by applicable law.</strong> If you give your consent to any further use of personal information, you can withdraw that consent at any time by contacting us using the details set out below.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>You have choices about your personal information, and in some circumstances, you may have the right to opt out or object to our uses of your personal information for these Purposes. For more information, or to exercise these or other rights (where available), see the Your Choices and Rights section below.</p>
<p id="tripservices"><strong>Trips/My Trips Services.</strong> If you register for an account, send a booking confirmation to our Trips/My Trips service or make a booking through our Services, you will have access to our Trips/My Trips service, where we will collect your travel information to create and maintain your travel itineraries. If you directly send us booking confirmation emails, you authorize us to parse these emails automatically or manually and to add the information you provide to your Trips/My Trips account, along with other information that we have collected (including saving a copy of the original email to your Trips/My Trips account). If you sign up for the synchronization of your emails to our Trips/My Trips service, you authorize us to access the emails in the email accounts you have connected to Trips/My Trips, to regularly review these emails in order to identify those that are booking confirmations that we can import into our Trips/My Trips service, to parse these emails automatically or manually and to add the information we have collected to your Trips/My Trips account (including saving a copy of the original email to your Trips/My Trips account). To the extent permissible by our email synchronization partners, we use the information in your Trips/My Trips account to show you more relevant search results (e.g., accommodations you previously booked) or to provide you statistics about your travels, and we may use such information for marketing communications as described above. If you use or have itineraries as part of our Trips/My Trips Service, you can send or grant access to your itinerary to anyone you choose. Your itinerary may contain enough details (e.g., booking reference codes) to allow the recipient to cancel or modify your booking, perform a check-in, etc. You should only share your itinerary with people you trust. Please also refer to our <a href="/help/tripshelp" class="_hB3">Getting Started with Trips/My Trips</a> page and the detailed <a href="/faq" class="_hB3">Trips/My Trips FAQ</a> for answers to frequently asked questions, and visit your Account page to update your account settings and preferences. If you choose to display your itinerary on publicly-viewable web pages (Facebook, for instance), that information may be collected and used by others.</p>
<p id="ecommunications"><strong>Electronic Communications.</strong> Consistent with the above Purposes and as permitted by applicable law, we may communicate with you via electronic messages, including email, text message, or mobile push notification to:</p>
<ul class="_kP _bGK">
<li><strong>Send you information relating to our products and Services.</strong> This may include booking confirmations and updates, receipts, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages.</li>
<li><strong>Send you marketing communications.</strong> In other situations, subject to the <a class="_hB3" href="#choicesandrights">Your Choices and Rights</a> section below and applicable law, we may communicate with you about contests, offers, promotions, rewards, upcoming events, and other news about products and Services offered by us, our group companies, our travel partners, and other business partners.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>With your consent, where required, we may contact you at the mobile phone number that you provide to us by way of direct dial calls, autodialed and prerecorded message calls, and text messages in connection with the above Purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Our Role as Data Controller.</strong> For purposes of European Union law and similar data protection regimes, we generally act as a data controller, meaning we determine the purposes and means of processing your personal information. Our travel partners to whom we may connect you to make reservations are also data controllers. To learn more about how a travel partner may use your personal information, you should review its privacy notice.</p>
<p><strong>Processing Bases and Consequences.</strong> When we process your personal information, we rely on the following legal bases:</p>

<p id="sharingwithtravel"><strong>Sharing with Travel Partners.</strong> Our travel partners include online travel agencies, hotels, airlines, car rental companies, and travel insurance providers. When you make a request for a booking or reservation from one of our partners through our Services, we share your information with that travel partner to facilitate the booking or reservation and provide the services you requested. Depending on the request, this may include your name, contact information, passport information, frequent flyer details, itinerary details as described above, your preferences, any special requests or accommodations, information or comments that you choose to submit (if any), and other information as required by the particular travel partner. Your information is provided to the travel partner, just as it would be if you contacted the travel partner directly. If you provide a mobile phone number in connection with your request, travel partners may send you text messages regarding your request. Some travel partners also require you to provide credit or debit card account information to secure your reservation.</p>
<p>When you make a request, we also share with the travel partner additional information about you, such as information about your travel activity and history, and/or information that we collect from you and third parties. Travel partners use this information for their own purposes, which may include to improve their products or services and to provide you with targeted advertising and marketing communications, where permitted under law.</p>
<p id="sharingwithcompanies"><strong>Sharing with Our Group Companies.</strong> We share your information with our affiliates and subsidiaries in the U.S. and worldwide, as well as with our parent corporation, Booking Holdings, Inc., and its other subsidiaries (collectively, as also defined earlier in this Privacy Policy, our “group companies”). We may share your information with our group companies for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="_kP _bGK">
<li>Provide you with integrated services (including to administer and manage reservations, bookings, services, and payments across our affiliated platforms).</li>
<li>Provide personalized offers or send you marketing communications with your consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.</li>
<li>Enable <strong>“single sign-on”</strong>, i.e., allowing you to log into a shared account for multiple Booking Holdings Inc. brands using a single set of log-in credentials, which allows us to, for example, show your reservations and bookings made through the websites, applications, and services of our group companies on your account page, and allow our group companies to show information in your respective account(s) with them.</li>
<li>Provide customer support services.</li>
<li>Detect, prevent, and investigate fraud and misuse of our services, other illegal activities, and data breaches.</li>
<li>Analyze how users use our independent and affiliated platforms, including so that we may improve existing products and services and develop new features, products, and services that may be of interest to our users.</li>
<li>Ensure compliance with applicable law.</li>

The information we share includes information collected through your use of our Services (e.g., information about your bookings and reservations for flights, hotels, car rentals, or other travel accommodations) and information we collect about you through the use of cookies and similar technologies (e.g., information about the websites you visit; information about your searches, including the cities or destinations you search for, the types of accommodations you search for, your travel preferences, price range, intended travel dates, and the number of travelers in your party).</p>
<p>For example, if you frequently search for flights from Seattle to Paris around certain holidays, we may share that information with a particular airline partner so it can better understand which of our customers are interested in flights from Seattle to Paris on certain dates. The airline partner may then, for example, use this information to offer you a promotion.</p>

<li><strong>Advertising Analytics/Measurement.</strong> We make use of analytics cookies as part of our online advertising campaigns to learn how users interact with our Sites after they have been shown an online advertisement, which may include advertisements on third-party websites. In particular, our Sites use Google Analytics 360 Suite, including Google Analytics Advertising, which are web analytics and analytics advertising services provided by Google, Inc., which use third party cookies. Where required, our Sites have activated the IP address anonymization functionality so that the IP address of the user is shortened by Google.

In addition, we may share website usage information about visitors to our Sites with third-party advertising companies for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements and for market research analysis on our Sites and other sites. For these purposes, we and our third-party advertising companies may place pixel tags (also called clear gifs) on some of the pages you visit on our Sites. We will then use the information that is collected using these pixel tags to serve you relevant advertisements when you are visiting other sites on the Internet. These advertisements may be based on your interests, for example, on the basis of specific searches you conducted on our Sites during earlier browsing sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Other Cookies:</strong> Our partners, who provide certain features on our Sites or display advertising based on your browsing activity, also use Local Storage such as HTML5, to collect and store content information and preferences.

However, if we share your email address, we share it solely in hashed, non-human-readable form.</p>
