      <h1>ChurchTrac Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>We are very concerned about your privacy. This 
      privacy statement has been created in order to demonstrate our commitment 
      to your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and 
      dissemination practices for this website.</p>
	  
      <p>We gather basic information about you, such 
      as name, church name, email address, mailing address, and telephone when 
      you request information, download software, or request that software be 
      mailed to you. <u>The contact information you submit is never shared with 
      a third party under any circumstances</u>. The company that hosts our 
      website may also record your IP address in order to provide us with site 
      statistic information (i.e., the number of people who visit each page of 
      our site).</p>
	  
      <p>We use the information you provide to us to send you 
      information about our products and services. From time to time we will use 
      the information we collected from you to supply you with information about 
      program updates, enhancements, new product offerings, or special pricing 
      or promotions. 
      If at any time you wish to be removed from our mailing list, please let us 
      know.</p>
	  
      <p>When you purchase a product from our website, we 
      refer you to the Authorize.net site in order to collect payment. 
      Authorize.net does not 
      reveal your credit card information to us, and we never have access to 
      this information. After you have completed the checkout process at the 
      Authorize.net site, Authorize.net sends a receipt of the transaction to you and 
      to us, and we are never privy to the information you provide to them.</p>
	  
      <p>From time to time we may ask website or ChurchTrac 
      users to respond voluntarily to a survey in order to help us improve our 
      products and services. Any information collected will be kept confidential 
      and not shared with any third parties. This information is used internally 
      for the sole purpose of providing better products and services to our 
      customers.</p>
	  
      <p>Unless you request otherwise within your 
      communication with us, we may extract brief excerpts from complimentary 
      emails  that you send for use on our website testimonials on in 
      advertising. Your name may be used in connection with your quote to ensure 
      the testimony's validity. In order to guarantee the authenticity and 
      sincerity of such quotes, we do not compensate anyone for providing 
      testimonies. You may ask us to remove a quote that is attributed to you 
      from our web site or from our advertising at any time, and we will comply 
      with your request voluntarily and remove it as soon as possible.</p>
	  
      <p>In general, we do not send email to anyone who has 
      not purchased, downloaded, or requested a CD from us. We currently host 
      our email list through Vertical Response, and they ensure we only send 
      emails to customers who have opted to receive emails from ChurchTrac. To ensure your 
      receipt of emails from us, you should add churchtrac.com to your 
      address book or spam filter white list.</p>
	  
      <p>If you provide a phone number, we use this 
      information to contact you only when you require assistance that cannot be 
      provided through email, when you request we contact you by phone, or when 
      we are unable to respond to your support requests via email. We will not 
      call you for any other purpose, including sales calls. We will never share 
      your phone number with third parties.</p>
	  
      <p>On rare occasions, you may encounter problems with 
      your ChurchTrac data file that requires you to email your data file to 
      technical support for repair. After your file has been fixed, it will be 
      sent back to you, and any copies or emails containing your data file will 
      be destroyed. The software that we provide may contact our web servers 
      periodically, with your permission, in order to check for program updates. 
      No personally identifiable information is transmitted during this process. 
      If you encounter an error and choose to report this error to us, the your 
      basic contact information is transmitted to us, along with a description 
      of the error. This information is used to contact you to provide support 
      for the error you encountered.</p>
	  
      <p>Your purchase information and customer data is not 
      accessible via the internet. Access to your customer information 
      (including contact information) is password 
      protected and only accessible by a small number of senior staff at 
      ChurchTrac. Procedures are in place to limit access to and safeguard your information.</p>
	  
      <p>If you subscribe to the ChurchTrac data sharing 
      service, you will have a secure account set up on our server to assist the 
      software in sharing data between all your computers. Access to the server 
      is extremely limited and safeguarded.</p>
	  
      <p>If you wish to stop receiving information from us,
      <a href="support.htm">contact us</a>, or reply to an email from our 
      domain with the subject "Remove". If you have any questions regarding this 
      privacy policy or our use of your information, please contact us.</p>
