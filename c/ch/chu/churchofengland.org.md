# Privacy Statement

It is important for you to appreciate that the central website provides extensive links to other independent sites, both within the Church of England and elsewhere.

## Data collected.

As with the vast majority of websites, the Church of England automatically logs certain information about every request made of it (see below for more details). This information is used for system administration, for bug tracking, and for producing usage statistics. The logged information will be kept but reviewed periodically.

Relevant subsets of this data may be passed to computer security teams as part of investigations of computer misuse involving this site or other computing equipment within the hosting organisation. Data may also on occasion be passed to the administrators of other computer systems to enable investigation of problems accessing this site or of system misconfigurations. Otherwise the logged information is not passed to any third party except if required by law. Summary statistics are extracted from this data and some of these may be made publicly available, but those that are do not include information from which individuals could be identified.

Where forms are provided on this site, the pages containing these forms include information on how data submitted on them will be processed and used.

  * The name or network address of the computer making the request.

  * The date and time of connection.
  * The HTTP request, which contains the identification of the document requested.
  * The status code of the request (success or failure etc.).
  * The number of data bytes sent in response.
