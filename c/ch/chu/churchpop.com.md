# Privacy Policy | ChurchPOP

This web site is owned and operated by Eternal Word Television Network, Inc. (EWTN). We recognize that visitors to our site may be concerned about the information they provide to us, and how we treat that information. This Privacy Policy addresses those concerns and our commitment to protecting your privacy on this web site. The information we collect from you is used to improve the content of our web site and to provide you with information, products or other services available to you through EWTN. This Privacy Policy may be changed or updated from time to time and we recommend that you review these terms periodically.

Our Policy

EWTN respects and protects the privacy of our online visitors and donors. EWTN does not disclose, give, sell or transfer to third parties any personal information about our visitors without their permission, unless required by law.

Throughout its history, EWTN has never shared its donor mailing lists or personal information with third parties. It remains EWTN’s policy that mailing lists, both postal and electronic, are never sold or exchanged with third parties.

Credit Card and Other Personal Information

EWTN uses industry standard efforts such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers (SSL) to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We make every reasonable effort to prevent the loss, misuse or theft of the information under our control.

We care about the safety and security of online transactions. We use the industry standard high grade encryption and security protocol to communicate with your browser software. This method makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept the credit card information you send to us. Third parties with which we work process credit card transactions using high grade encryption and security protocols.

Our Commitment to Accuracy

In addition to maintaining privacy and security controls for information you share with us, EWTN uses error checking procedures to accurately and completely process your transaction information. Our staff is available Monday through Friday from 9am to 6pm (US Eastern Time) to answer questions by phone at [1-205-271-2989](tel:\(205\)%20271-2989) or by email at [viewer@ewtn.com](mailto:viewer@ewtn.com).

Changes are made to our error checking procedures as necessary to improve our system and independent external audits are periodically conducted to ensure the appropriate processing of your information from our web site.

Use of “Cookies”

Visitors to the EWTN web site should be aware that non-personal information and data is automatically collected by the EWTN web site through the use of “cookies.” “Cookies” are small text files which a web site can use to recognize repeat visitors, facilitate a visitor’s ongoing access to, and use of, the site, and allow a web site to track usage behavior and compile data that will allow content improvements. Cookies are not programs that come onto a visitor’s system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique identifier to the visitor that has no meaning outside the assigning web site. If a visitor does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the visitor to deny or accept the cookie feature. EWTN uses “cookie” technology only to obtain non-personal information from its online visitors in order to improve visitors’ online experience and facilitate their visit of EWTN’s web site.

Links

This web site may contain links to other web sites. Please be aware that EWTN is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our web site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information from you. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the EWTN web site.

Message Boards and Public Forums

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on our web site (for example, on message boards such as the Catholic Q&A and Bulletin Board or through email) that information may be collected and used by others. By posting personal information on our web site that is publicly accessible by others, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

Note to Parents on Our Privacy Policy

EWTN encourages children to learn more about the Catholic Faith through the use of our web site and in particular through our EWTNKids web site. However, we ask that this be done only with their parent’s knowledge and supervision. For this reason, EWTN has established a separate EWTNKids Children’s Privacy Policy which adheres to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, enacted by the U.S. Congress, and its rules on collecting personal information from minors.

If you no longer wish to receive electronic mailings from us, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the “unsubscribe” information contained at the bottom of the message or by contacting us as indicated below.
