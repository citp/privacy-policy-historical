You are giving your information to Churchill Insurance Company Limited. In this Information statement **‘we’** **‘us’** and **‘our’** refers to Churchill Insurance Company Limited unless otherwise stated.

Churchill Insurance Company Limited is a member of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group (The Group). For information about The Group, please visit the [RBS Group website](http://www.rbs.com/about-rbs/group-structure.ashx "RBS Group website \(opens in a new window\)") or call 0131 556 8555 (Textphone 0845 900 5960).

If you contact us electronically, we may collect your electronic identifier e.g. Internet Protocol (IP) address or telephone number supplied by your service provider.

We will use your information to manage your insurance policy, including underwriting and claims handling. This may include disclosing it to other insurers, third party underwriters and re-insurers.

Your information comprises all the details we hold about you and your transactions and includes information obtained from third parties.

We may use and share your information with other members of the Group to help us and them:

  * assess financial and insurance risks;
  * recover debt;
  * prevent and detect crime;
  * develop our services, systems and relationships with you;
  * understand our customers’ requirements; 
  * develop and test products and services.



We do not disclose your information to anyone outside the Group except:

  * where we have your permission; or
  * where we are required or permitted to do so by law; or
  * to credit reference and fraud prevention agencies and other companies that provide a service to us or you; or
  * where we may transfer rights and obligations under this agreement.



We may transfer your information to other countries on the basis that anyone to whom we pass it provides an adequate level of protection. However, such information may be accessed by law enforcement agencies and other authorities to prevent and detect crime and comply with legal obligations.

From time to time we may change the way we use your information. Where we believe you may not reasonably expect such a change we shall write to you. If you do not object to the change within 60 days, you consent to that change.

Some of the personal information we ask you for may be sensitive personal data (as defined by the Data Protection Act 1998), such as information about health or criminal convictions. We will not use such sensitive personal data about you or others except for the specific purpose for which you provide it and to provide the services described in your policy documents.

You will have been asked to agree to this when you first contacted us but please ensure that you only provide us with sensitive information about other people with their agreement.  


It is our policy to deal with your spouse or a partner who calls us on your behalf, provided they are named on the policy. If you would like someone else to deal with your policy on your behalf on a regular basis please let us know. In some exceptional cases we may also deal with other people who call on your behalf, with your consent. If at any time you would prefer us to deal only with you, please let us know.

To assess your insurance application and the terms on which cover may be offered, we may obtain information about you from credit reference agencies to check your credit status and identity. These agencies will record our enquiries. This will not affect your credit standing.

If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified or suspected, details may be passed to fraud prevention agencies.

Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.

We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example when:

  * checking applications for, and managing credit and other facilities and recovering debt;

  * checking insurance proposals and claims;

  * checking details of job applicants and employees.




We, and other organisations that may access and use information recorded by fraud prevention agencies, may do so from other countries.

We can provide the names and addresses of the agencies we use if you would like a copy of your information held by them. Please contact us at the address below. The agencies may charge a fee.

If you would like a copy of the information we hold about you, please write to: The Data Protection Officer, Regulatory Risk Department, Churchill Court, Westmoreland Road, Bromley BR1 1DP quoting your reference. A fee may be payable.  


Any personal data saved is held safely on our mainframe computer, with security systems preventing unauthorised access and we always ensure it is treated confidentially. For further information regarding our security provisions please see Further security.

Please note that we use cookies on this website. A cookie is a software application that tracks users' navigation of the site and stores that information on their hard drives. This allows us to understand our users' habits and preferences, enabling us to customise our services for our users and to provide an enhanced user experience. We may, for example, use cookies to store registration information so that you do not have to provide it to us on subsequent visits.  


We take security very seriously and we use one of the strongest available security systems to protect your communications with us. Our quote and buy process is automatically protected using something called a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) between your computer and ours. SSL works in the following ways: 

It prevents impersonation - you can tell that you are using a genuine SSL site by the padlock symbol at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on either the padlock or the image opposite will reveal our Registration Certificate that is issued by Verisign, a leading Internet security company.*

It encrypts data - as soon as your computer has recognised our computer they encrypt all information that is passed between them. Data encryption means that no one else can read or change your information as it travels over the Internet.

It prevents scrambling - SSL uses a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to prevent anyone tampering with our Internet site. Your computer will always check this code before it takes a message from us. This means that if anyone tried to interfere with a message, your computer would not recognise the code and would alert you.

*There are two minor problems with certain versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer. Neither problem has any effect on the actual security in force, but may make it appear to you as if it is not fully secure.

**Internet Explorer 4.** The padlock symbol does not always appear at the bottom when it should. A full description of this error, number Q154621, is at <http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q154/6/21.asp>

**Internet Explorer 5**. If you click on the padlock symbol to view the security certificate the following message may be displayed: "This certificate has failed to verify for all of its intended purposes". The other details of the certificate shown are correct. A full description of this error, number Q233479, is at <http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q233/4/79.asp>
