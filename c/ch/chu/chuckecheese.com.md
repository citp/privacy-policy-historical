The chart lists the names of some of our third party partners and support provider entities, which may provide administrative services to our Websites. These entities may change from time to time.

If you have any inquiries regarding our partner’s privacy practices or how they use your child’s personal information, please contact us directly at [_guestrelations@cecentertainment.com_](http://guestrelations@cecentertainment.com/).

  1. **  User Access and Choice**



If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update, or request deletion of personally identifiable information collected by contacting us by emailing our Customer Support at [guestrelations@cecentertainment.com](mailto:guestrelations@cecentertainment.com) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.  To safeguard your information, we will also take steps to verify your identity before granting access or correction. Although we do not seek to collect information from children, parents may, after providing proper parental identification, request to review, update, or delete their own child's information that may have been submitted.

To remove images from the site, we will send an email to the user with a link for removal and then proceed with deletion if the link is clicked on and deletion confirmed on that webpage. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**Opt-out Preferences**

Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails. We do send transactional emails when processing your orders and responding to your feedback/questions.  You may not opt out of these emails as they are not promotional in nature.

**Surveys**

We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site.  If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). 

We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), to send participants an email newsletter, or contact if there are issues.

We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

  1. **  Tracking Technologies / Cookies**



A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. 

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.  Session cookies would be used to improve the user experience for completing forms or the reservation process.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies are used to track your behavior so that we can provide you with relevant messaging and improve your overall experience. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie>

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.

**Web Beacons / Gifs**

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

**Analytics / Log Files**

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. This data is used to track Internet usage and behavior so that we can retarget you with relevant messaging and to improve the user experience.

**3 rd Party Tracking**

The use of cookies by our tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.  Our tracking utility company use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, in order for you to use the shopping cart, etc. 

Our third party partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our site. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personally identifiable information.

**Mobile Analytics**

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone.  This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.  We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application as we do not collect any personal information through the application.

  1. **Security**



The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at [guestrelations@cecentertainment.com](mailto:guestrelations@cecentertainment.com).

Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

**CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**
