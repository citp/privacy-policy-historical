                        Avenues™ respects your privacy and wants to promote 
                        trust and confidence on the internet. As such, Avenues™ 
                        feels it is necessary to disclose to you what information 
                        this site collects and tracks and what we do with the 
                        information that we collect.
                        <p>Information security is critical to our business. We 
                          work to protect the security of your information during 
                          transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, 
                          which encrypts information you input. We store information 
                          gathered on secure computers. The number of employees 
                          involved in the management of the data center that have 
                          physical access to these computers is limited. We use 
                          advanced security technology to prevent our computers 
                          from being accessed by unauthorized persons. It is important 
                          for you (Sub-Merchant) to protect against unauthorized 
                          access to your Login ID/password and to your computer. 
                          Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer

                          Avenues™' services.</p>
                        <p>Currently, Avenues™ collects personal information 
                          on our Sub-Merchants, through the Sub-Merchant registration 
                          process, the service agreement that they execute and 
                          various submitted documents of the Sub-Merchant's creditability 
                          as required by Avenues™ from time to time. Avenues™ 
                          asks customers to supply various personal data when 
                          placing an order, such as name and address, telephone 
                          number, and E-mail address. Avenues™ uses this 
                          data only for the purpose of filling an order, or communicating 
                          with the customer or Sub-Merchant about the status of 
                          an order. The Sub-Merchants however, are able to collect 
                          personal information on their customers via the purchases 
                          that are made. The data Avenues™ collects is used 
                          in the aggregate to give us demographic information 
                          about the entire Avenues™ audience in order to 
                          improve the service to you and to our Sub-Merchants, 
                          to perform statistical analysis of the collective characteristics 
                          and behavior of our Sub-Merchants and visitors, to measure 
                          overall patron demographics and interests regarding 
                          specific areas of the Avenues™ domain and to analyze 
                          how and where to use our resources. We use cookies to 
                          help us determine which sites users link to, and which 
                          services Sub-Merchants and visitors use.<br>
                        </p>
                        We also track information like the domain name from which 
                        you contact us, the pages you request, the products you 
                        buy, the referring site, and the time that you spend on 
                        the site. For everyone who visits a Avenues™ Sub-Merchant 
                        purchase page, we log IP addresses, the type of operating 
                        system that person's computer uses, and the type of browser 
                        software used by him. From the IP address, we can determine 
                        the Internet Service Provider and the geographic location 
                        of your point of connectivity.
                        <p>If you are our Sub-Merchant, then the personal information 
                          you provide - name, address, etc.-allows us to inform 
                          you about updates, or changes to the service and to 
                          notify you of products and services of Avenues™, 
                          its backend service providers and affiliates that we 
                          believe may be of interest to you.</p>
                        <p>Avenues™ uses reasonable precautions to keep the 
                          personal information disclosed to us secure and will

                          for the sole purposes of fraud protection and risk reduction. 
                          However, in the case of abuse or breach of security, 
                          we are not responsible for any breach of security or 
                          for any actions of any third parties which receive the

                          3) we need to send the information to companies who 
                          work on behalf of Avenues™ to provide a product
