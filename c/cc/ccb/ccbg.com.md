# Capital City Bank Group

At **Capital City Bank Group, Inc**., we are committed to protecting your privacy.  The following policy applies to Capital City Bank Group, Inc., which presently includes Capital City Bank, Capital City Trust Company and Capital City Services Company.  Another subsidiary, Capital City Securities, Inc. is governed by a separate privacy policy issued by INVEST Financial Corporation under a joint marketing agreement.  It provides the same level of consumer and customer privacy and security as does this policy.  Please take a moment to read this information, and you may call us at **888.671.0400** if you have any questions.

## Information We Collect About You

We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources: (1) information we receive from you on applications or other forms; (2) information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others; and (3) information we receive from a consumer reporting agency.

## Sharing of Your Information Outside Capital City Bank Group

Unlike many financial institutions, we do not currently share your information with outside or non-affiliated companies for purposes other than allowable under the regulation. If we ever change our policy to allow us to disclose your information to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes not covered by a regulatory exception, we will provide you with advance notice of such change and you will have a reasonable opportunity to opt-out of such information sharing.  Any opt-out election you make in advance will be honored at that time.

Non-public personal information may be revealed to groups or entities outside our company when (1) it is necessary to provide services required to maintain your accounts or complete transactions **** you have initiated or (2) when mandated or permitted by law, or (3) as necessary in the event of a national emergency.  We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.

To help us provide the best possible service to our clients, under some circumstances, your information may be shared within the Capital City Bank Group. The types of information shared with affiliates may include internally-generated information (such as account balances, payment and transaction history, etc) about your accounts with our company or externally-generated information (such as information on your credit report or loan application).  If you prefer not to have this information used for marketing purposes by affiliates of Capital City Bank, you may request that we not do so by writing to us at: Capital City Bank, Privacy Officer, P. O. Box 900, Tallahassee, FL  32302-0900, or by calling Capital City Bank Direct toll-free at 888.671.0400.

## Reporting of Your Information to Credit Reporting Agencies

Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.

## Accuracy of Your Information

Every effort is made to ensure our records of your information are complete and correct.  If an error is noted on your statement or in any other communication from us, please contact us at the number listed on your account materials or call Capital City Bank Direct at 850.671.0400 or toll-free at 888.671.0400.

## Security of Your Information
