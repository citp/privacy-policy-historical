# CCleaner Cloud | Privacy policy

## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains our procedures for collecting, using and disclosing your information.

By using our Service you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.

**1\. Definitions**

  * "CCleaner Cloud" means the Service.
  * "CCleaner Cloud Website" means the website at www.ccleaner.com.
  * A "Device" is any computer used to access the Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other electronic device.
  * "Information" is all different forms of data, content and information described below.
  * The "Service" is our services available at the CCleaner Cloud Website available at www.ccleaner.com.



**2\. Data collection**  
Some information about you we collect passively - information that your computer and your browser send automatically while you browse our site. Other information we actively solicit, such as your email address when you subscribe to our newsletter. Log files tell us generally about the visitors to our site - general geographic regions, length of visits, pages clicked on, and so forth. The data we collect can be broken down into these groups:

  * Registration data: When you register for CCleaner Cloud, we collect some personal information, such as your name, email address and other contact details you provide to us.
  * Computer data: The Service gathers technical information about your computers and the features of the Service that you use. Some of this information is then accessible by you via the CCleaner Cloud Website and may also be used by us to answer questions that you may have about your account and to develop and improve the Service.
  * Analyzing data: The Service may analyze your computer data solely for the purpose of improving the Service. This allows us to fix bugs and improve the accuracy of the Service.
  * Data sensitivity: The Service analyses the names and locations of some files on your computer and these names and locations may be stored on our servers to allow us to display them to you. If you wish to keep this information private - i.e. to prevent this information being sent to our servers, you are able to opt out of this feature in the tray application settings.
  * Protecting your data: We utilize all modern precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information that you store on CCleaner Cloud, by employing technological, physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully-developed security procedures. For example, when you enter sensitive information (such as login credentials and all your activity on our Service platform) we encrypt the transmission of that information using Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures are used in an effort to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you authorized to access your data.
  * Deleting your data: We store your data as long as is necessary to provide you with the Service. If you delete information from the site, we may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
  * Cookies: We use cookies and log files to track our users and may analyze the data to provide a better experience for site visitors.   
Cookies are small text files that are written to your hard drive by your browser and help the site 'remember' who you are.   
For example, when you log in, the site writes a cookie to your computer so that you don't need to log in again if you come back within a certain period of time.   
We may use "persistent cookies" to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service.   
We may use "session ID cookies" to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service.   
You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.   
If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.



**3\. Data sharing**  
We hate spam. We will never spam you with any unsolicited email and we do not sell your personal information to third parties.   
We may use certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve the Service. These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy.   
We will not otherwise disclose your information to any external party, unless we are required to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of CCleaner Cloud or its users; or (d) to protect our proprietary rights.   
We may disclose your non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage statistics of our Service.   
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or Files, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.

**4\. Newsletter Registration**  
If you choose to sign up for the CCleaner Cloud newsletter, we will send you an email confirmation to ensure that you in fact requested the newsletter.   
Your email address is always kept confidential, and we will only use it to send you newsletters or special announcements unless you opt in to other marketing communications.   
You may unsubscribe at any time and details on how to do this are included in every email.

**5\. CCleaner Cloud Software and Information Usage**  
By installing CCleaner Cloud, you are agreeing to the Terms and Conditions in our Terms of Use that appear when you run the installation program. Please refer to those Terms for more information.

**6\. Changes to this Privacy Policy**  
We may change this privacy policy in the future. For example, if we offer a new type of product or service that collects different types of information, we might outline our use of that information here. As a result, please check this page regularly for changes.
