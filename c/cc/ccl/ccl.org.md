## Overview

This Privacy Policy covers and describes how Center for Creative Leadership® ("CCL") collects, uses and discloses information CCL® collects through its Web site [www.ccl.org](https://web.archive.org/leadership/index.aspx), myCCL service, and Internet Assessment System (IAS). The use of information collected through CCL systems shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged CCL. 

The Center for Creative Leadership ("CCL") is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of our constituents. CCL subscribes to the American Psychological Association's code of ethics regarding the use of an individual's personal data for research; this code is particularly concerned with protecting the rights of the person.

CCL has received TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program. The details of the TRUSTe program are viewable by clicking the TRUSTe seal on CCL's Web sites or by [clicking here](http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html).

The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through [www.ccl.org](https://web.archive.org/leadership/index.aspx), myCCL and IAS. It does not cover information that may be collected through our mobile applications. 

Questions regarding our privacy policy or practices may be directed to us at [info@ccl.org](mailto:info@ccl.org). Unresolved privacy or data use concerns that CCL has not addressed satisfactorily should be directed to TRUSTe at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>.

### Data Sharing

CCL does not rent or sell information to any outside organizations. CCL also limits the information it collects to the minimum necessary to provide outstanding service. All financial information given to CCL is kept secure. CCL has partnerships with third parties where basic contact information and data are shared to deliver contracted services and research with CCL clients.

### Data Retention

CCL will retain personal data for as long as it is needed to provide services to its Clients. CCL will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### General Legal Disclaimer

CCL may also disclose personal information:

  * As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process 
  * When it is believed in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect others' safety, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request
  * If CCL is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, users will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of personal information, as well as any choices users may have regarding their personal information
  * To any other third party for whom users or clients have given prior consent



### Changes To This Policy

CCL may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If any material changes are made, users will be notified by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in their account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. Users are encouraged to periodically review this page for the latest information on CCL's privacy practices.

## Assessment & Research Data

The Center for Creative Leadership's goal is to improve the quality of leadership in organizations through research, education, and the dissemination of knowledge. As part of this effort, CCL gathers research data on both organizations and people. These data are then analyzed and the results are used by CCL and published in summary form in reports designed for wide circulation. By providing personal data to CCL, users agree that we may use that data to deliver the requested service and communicate information regarding CCL-related programs, products and services in which they may be interested.

Since the organizations and people who participate in our training programs and other activities represent valuable sources for research data, the information collected from them is stored in CCL databases and may become a part of a research project. CCL has a strong commitment to protect the rights, privacy, and dignity of every person who participates in these activities. For this reason there are a number of safeguards in place:

  1. CCL is guided by the American Psychological Association's code of ethics regarding the use of an individual's personal data for research; this code is particularly concerned with protecting the rights of the person.
  2. Questions related to race/ethnicity or family history are for U.S. research and reporting purposes. U.S. law encourages us to collect information on the racial demographics of our clients. Other legal jurisdictions outside of the United States may not permit the collection of such information. Therefore, answer race/ethnicity or family history questions only if you reside in the United States.
  3. Assessment data collected about or from an individual as part of a leadership development activity are shared with and explained to that person.
  4. Information collected about or from an individual is considered confidential. Individuals receive feedback on assessments only from qualified Feedback Coaches.
  5. Although CCL has never been required to release information without an individual's permission (or the permission of an authorized legal representative such as an executor, executrix, or the holder of a valid power of attorney), it is acknowledged that in the extremely rare case of a court order, CCL might be compelled to do so.
  6. Data collected from surveys published by CCL are stored in its database. They become a part of the norm group, containing thousands of scores, against which individual scores are calibrated. Periodically, CCL publishes data on groups of people. Individuals are never identified in these reports. Specific organizations are identified only if prior written approval is received from the organization. CCL may also provide organization summary profiles on groups of individuals in that organization if the number of individuals is large enough to be potentially meaningful.
  7. If it is desired, response data can be removed from CCL's research database. [Click here](https://web.archive.org/leadership/pdf/PrivacyDataForm.pdf) to access the Remove Data form which should be submitted to one of the address options noted on the form.
  8. In order to ensure that all assessment materials for individuals are received and scored, data are typically not deleted until 60-90 days after receipt of the Remove Data request. Please note that once data is removed from the database, CCL will not be able to provide a duplicate feedback report at a later date or use that data in any group profiles.



* * *

## Access to Data Controlled by our Clients

In many cases, CCL collects information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. 

An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to CCL's Client (the data controller). If the Client requests CCL to remove the data, a response will be provided within 30 business days of their request.
