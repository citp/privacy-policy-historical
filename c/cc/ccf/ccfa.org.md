### What information do we collect and how do we use it?

You may browse our website without identifying yourself or providing any personally identifiable information. When you interact with us through your computer, however, we do record certain non-identifying site-usage data, such as your number of visits to our website pages. 

If you elect to donate, register for an event, or sign up for any of our publications, you will be asked to provide personal information such as your name, address, city, state, zip, phone number, and email address. 

We may use this information to communicate with you by email or postal mail from time to time. The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation keeps all names, addresses, and all other personal information supplied by participants of our website strictly confidential. The Foundation discourages sharing of personal information in public online forums. Please keep in mind, however, that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on message boards, through email, or in chat areas, that information may be collected and used by others. We may receive confirmation via HTML code when you open an email from us, which helps us measure our reach and ensure reduce or eliminate duplicate e-mails. If you no longer wish to receive e-mails from us, please unsubscribe or change your profile settings.

Some parts of our website may also use 'cookies,' which are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer through your web browser. You may configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent.

### Do we share your information?

The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation keeps your personal information strictly confidential. However, we may occasionally make our constituent's names and addresses available to other reputable healthcare non-profit organizations. Your name is only available to these organizations for a limited time and your information will not be directly associated with the Foundation. Your information will not be readily accessible to other organizations unless you choose to respond to their initial mailing. We DO NOT share email addresses or other health-related data. To opt-out from donor mailing address list sharing that the Foundation may participate in with other organizations, email us at [info@crohnscolitisfoundation.org](mailto:info@crohnscolitisfoundation.org) with the request “Do Not Share” in the subject line or message (please include the mailing address) or call us at 1-800-932-2423 to have us update the record.

For disclosure of demographic information (e.g., rental or exchange of donor lists with other organizations), the Foundation as a minimum will use an "opt-out" approach. An "opt-out" is obtained when an individual declines or "opts-out" of disclosures to third parties or from receiving any communication from the organization. You may opt-out at any time to cease receiving communications from the Foundation; If an individual does not opt-out, permission is deemed granted.

### What security do we provide to protect your personal information?

The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation uses multiple electronic and administrative safeguards to protect your information from unauthorized access, such as firewall technologies and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) security, (described below). Access to your account information is protected via system passwords which are changed periodically. Despite use of these safeguards, we cannot guarantee and do not represent that your information will always be secure from unauthorized access.

### Do we provide a secure environment for online transactions?

All credit card information collected through online transactions are processed with SSL security, an established protocol for transmitting information via the Internet which uses server authentication and data encryption to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and available only to authorized staff members of the Foundation.
