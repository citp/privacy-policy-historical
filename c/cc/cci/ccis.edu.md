### Collection of Personal Information

Columbia College collects personal information to make our Web services customizable for each user. For each visitor to our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes your operating system and Internet browser. Our Web server additionally records usage of pages by our visitors. We retain this information for research reports, and sometimes use this information so that we may improve the design and content of our Web site. 

Some of Columbia College's Web sites and services collect personally identifiable information to further adapt to our Web site visitors' needs. Some sites and services may require that you provide personally identifiable information in order to participate.

We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, or to respond to your inquiries about our offerings. We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when we make changes to our services, to fulfill a request by you, or to contact you about your account with us. We may also use your information to update internal systems.

### Cookies

To enhance and personalize your experience, some of our webpages use cookies. Cookies are text files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive to store your preferences.

### Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites

Some of our webpages may contain links to other Web sites whose information practices may be different than our own. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy policies as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. 

Agents and contractors of Columbia College who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this privacy policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Columbia College.

**Your information will never be shared, given, or sold to a third party without your express consent.** However, Columbia College may release personal information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to comply with law, enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or protect the rights, property, or safety of Columbia College staff, faculty, students, applicants or alumni.

### How Columbia College Protects Your Information

We have put in place appropriate software, hardware, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online. 

If any changes are made to the privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
