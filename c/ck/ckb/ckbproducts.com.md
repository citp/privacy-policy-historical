We do not use software to obtain your email address after visiting our site but you may choose to join our Mailing List

We believe your personal information is exactly that:

**When   placing an order is my personal information safe and confidential? **YES!  Safe and Confidential using SSL!****  
During a Secure SSL session, data passed back and forth between your computer and our server is secured by using key cryptography. Your computer exchanges key information with CKBProducts computers to create a private conversation that only your computer and our system can understand.  All credit card transactions have added security because they are broken into two (2) parts, scrambled, then sent through 2 different secure databases where we must match the two parts up before processing your order.
