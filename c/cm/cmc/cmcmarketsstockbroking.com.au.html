    <div id="page-body">
        <p>CMC Markets Stockbroking understands and respects your concerns regarding privacy of your personal information. Keeping our customers' personal information secure and using it only for the purposes for which you gave it to us, are important to us. </p>
        <p>In this Privacy Policy "we", "us" or "CMC Markets Stockbroking" means CMC Markets Stockbroking.</p>
        <p>CMC Markets Stockbroking is committed to safeguarding your personal information in accordance with the National Privacy Principles of the Privacy Act 1988. "Personal Information" for the purposes of this Policy is information about and which identifies individuals, whether that information is obtained from the relevant individual or a third party.</p>
        <p>In general we will not disclose personal information collected about you otherwise than for the purposes set out in this Policy, for a purpose you would reasonably expect, a purpose required by law, or a purpose otherwise disclosed to, or authorised by you. We may, in connection with particular services we offer you, make other privacy disclosures to you or seek your authority to use your personal information in ways which are different from or more specific than those stated in the privacy policy. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this privacy policy and those additional materials, the provisions of the additional materials will apply.</p>
        <h3>Personal information collected before December 21 2001</h3>
        <p>The National Privacy Principles came into force on 21 December 2001 but some of the Principles have application to personal information collected prior to as well as after that date. This means that for personal information we hold, which was collected prior to 21 December 2001, we will, in accordance with those particular Principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>take reasonable steps to ensure that such information, if used, is accurate, complete and up-to-date;</li>
            <li>take reasonable steps to protect if from misuse, loss or unauthorised access or disclosure; </li>
            <li>provide you with access to the information if we still use it; </li>
            <li>not use any government identifier to identify you; and </li>
            <li>only transfer such information overseas with your consent or as authorised by the Principles. Except in so far as this Privacy Policy further addresses the particular Principles reflected in those five matters, the remainder of this document is concerned with personal information which is collected on or after 21 December 2001.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Collection of personal information</h3>
        <p>CMC Markets Stockbroking will not ordinarily collect information about you except where you provide it to us or it is provided to us with your authority.</p>

        <p>We may also listen to and/or record telephone calls to which you are a party with us for training, transaction verification and quality control purposes.</p>
        <p>On occasions CMC Markets Stockbroking may need to collect personal information about you from third parties. If required by law, we will obtain your consent to collect personal information from third party sources.</p>
        <p>As a general rule CMC Markets Stockbroking will only collect information about you that is necessary for us to provide a service to you or maintain our relationship with you.

        </ul>

        <h3>Use and disclosure of personal information</h3>

        </ul>
