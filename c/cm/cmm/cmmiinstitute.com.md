If you continue using our Platform after the new terms take effect, you will be bound by the modified Privacy Notice.

Responding to legal requests and preventing harm

We may disclose information about a visitor in response to a facially valid request from a government agency or a private litigant in the form of a subpoena, court order or search warrant, or where we believe, in good faith, that it is necessary to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, and other legal matter.

**Aggregated, Anonymized, or Statistical Information**

We generate and use aggregated, anonymized, or statistical information about the use of our Platform. We may provide this information to third parties such as advisers or consultants for research, analytical or strategic purposes. This information is not intended to allow the identification of any specific visitor of our Platform.

#### Cookies and other Tracking Technologies

We use cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, statistical IDs, flash cookies, and similar tracking technologies to collect information about the activities of our visitors and registered user over time and across different Sites, such as the pages a visitor views, the links on which a visitor clicks, how frequently a visitor accesses the Platform, and other actions a visitor takes. We also collect log file information from a visitor’s browser such as web request, IP address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, and landing pages. We may use statistical modeling tools to attempt to recognize visitors across multiple devices.

We may retain the services of third party service providers who may link personal information about a visitor - such name or email address - to other information they may have – for example, past purchases. This information may allow us to identify assumed interests or preferences of that visitor, so that we can provide a visitor with more useful and relevant ads.

We use these technologies to:

  * Display information more effectively;
  * Gather statistical information about the use of the Platform to understand how our Platform is used, and improve design and functionality;
  * Store, on a visitor’s device, information about that visitor’s preferences and settings;
  * Recognize a visitor when the visitor moves from page to page, or returns to use the Platform;
  * Collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Platform, pages visited, and traffic data;
  * Track responses to our marketing and advertising campaigns; and for security purposes.



We also use these technologies to understand the activities and interests of our visitors, including to:

  * Measure traffic and usage of our Platform
  * Monitor the effectiveness of our Platform
  * Better understand the interests of visitors
  * Recognize new or past visitors to our Sites
  * Present more personalized content and advertisements
  * Optimize a visitor’s shopping experience
  * Identify visitors across devices, and third party websites.
  * Identify improvements or enhancements to our Platform that might be of interest to our visitors



**How to block Cookies**

You have the ability to control some of our use of cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. You may be able to configure certain browsers to delete or disable browser cookies. Most browsers contain information on how to control or delete cookies. These settings will typically be found in the “options” or “preferences” menu of a browser. You may also wish to refer to <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies> and <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/browsers/index.html> for information on commonly used browsers.

To control flash cookies, you can visit:  <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html>

Please note that blocking or disabling certain cookies may interfere with certain functionalities of some parts of our Platform. Choices you make about cookies are also browser and device specific. Further, while disabling a cookie may prevent the collection of information in the future, it does not prevent the use of information collected before the cookie was disabled. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking described in this notice will stop.

#### Analytics

Information collected by Google Analytics is transmitted to, and stored by, Google in accordance with its privacy practices. To see an overview of privacy at Google and how this applies to Google Analytics, please click here: <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245>.

To opt out of Google Analytics, please go to <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>

#### Interest-Based Advertising

We may – or may have third parties, on our behalf - display to a visitor interest-based advertising and other custom content regarding our capabilities, products or services that may be of interest to visitors. This advertising may be served to a visitor on our Platform, or in our emails or on third-party sites or may be placed on other websites. It may be based on assumed interests attributed to a specific visitor, based on the use of our Platform by that visitor, or use information gathered about that visitor over time across multiple sites. They may be based on other interactions you have with us or our Platform. They may be based on other activities and behaviors that you demonstrate online.

The information collected about a user’s use of our Platform, or across the Internet, the products in which the user appears to be interested, etc., may be used to build an assumed profile of a particular person. To do so, our service provider may place or recognize a unique cookie on the user’s browser and use other techniques, such as pixel tags. If you are using one of our mobile applications, our ad network partners may use and store your mobile device ID or Advertising ID to show ads that they consider relevant to you.

**How to Opt-out of Interest Based Advertising**

You may opt-out of receiving interest based advertising as explained below. The opt-out may be provided through specific tracking opt-out cookies. Please note that if you get a new computer, install a new browser, or erase or alter your browser’s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers), this may also clear any opt-out cookie.

Each visitor may opt out of receiving interest based advertising from advertising networks that may be delivered to them on other websites by visiting the following websites, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) or [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

Mobile device visitors may also download the AppChoices app at [www.aboutads.info/appchoices](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices) to opt out from interested based advertising served in mobile apps.

The features above will allow a visitor to opt out of many –but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage.

**Do Not Track**

Some browsers give individuals the ability to communicate that they wish not to be tracked while browsing on the Internet. The Internet industry has not yet agreed on a definition of what “Do Not Track” means, how compliance with “Do Not Track” would be measured or evaluated, or a common approach to responding to a “Do Not Track” signal. Consequently, due to the lack of guidance, we have not yet developed features that would recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals in response to California law.

#### Links to Third-Party Sites or Applications

The Platform may allow you to directly access applications or services operated by third parties. These links are provided for your convenience only and should be used at your discretion. These links do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement, or approval of the content, policies or practices of such third-parties’ applications.

This Privacy Notice does not apply to information provided to or gathered by the third parties that operate them. We are not responsible for any information these third-parties’ services may obtain or how they may use it. You should review their privacy notices to understand how they may use your information.

#### Data Retention

You can request that we stop using your information to provide you services, please contact us at the address provided in the “How to Contact Us” section, do so promptly after receiving your notice, and will dispose of the data as indicated above.

#### Right of Erasure

Individuals can submit a request to the CMMI Institute to have information about them deleted from the CMMI servers. CMMI will exercise its best effort to purge personal information from written and digital data archives for that individual within one hundred eighty (180) days of submission.

For a request to be processed successfully the following conditions must be met:

  * Submitting a request in writing to the address indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section below;
  * Clearly identifying the content or information to be removed;
  * Providing sufficient information to allow us to locate the content or information to be removed;

In addition, any individuals making such requests for the deletion of their information will be required to agree to sign a release from all claims against CMMI such that no legal action may be brought against CMMI by or on behalf of that individual in the future for any reason.

#### Information Security

We take reasonable measures to protect any personal information we may hold in order to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. In some areas of our Platforms, we may use Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) or Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) encryption technology to enhance data privacy and help prevent loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under ISACA control.

We cannot guarantee, however, that all information will remain secure. The Internet by its nature is a public forum. We encourage you to use caution when disclosing information online. Often, you are in the best situation to protect yourself online. You are responsible for protecting your login ID and password from third party access, and for selecting passwords that are secure.

#### Consent to Transfer of Information

If you are located outside the United States, please be aware that information we collect about you will be transferred for processing to the United States or other countries or jurisdictions that may not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.

#### Marketing Choices

We may use aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements targeted to a specific audience. Based upon the aggregated information we have collected about visitors, we display the advertisement to the intended audience based on these general criteria. Some advertisement methodology may be directed to a specific individual, and may be based on the specific apparent interest of the visitor of a specific device.

**Electronic Communications**

If you receive commercial electronic communications from us, you can unsubscribe from the receipt of future commercial electronic communications from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe link” provided in such communications. Please also note that if you do opt out of receiving emails from us, we may still send you important administrative messages (such as updates about your account or service changes), and you cannot opt out from receiving these messages. Please note that even though you have opt-out of receiving marketing-related Communications from us, we may still send you important administrative messages.

We may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes and/or to complete any transaction that you began before requesting a change or deletion. In addition, it is likely that residual information might remain within our databases, back-ups or other records and might not be removed.

**Shine the Light**

If you have an established relationship with us you may request from us a list of the categories of personal information we have disclosed to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and a list of all third parties to whom we have shared that information. We will include in that list the names and addresses of the third parties who received the information and used it (or who we believe may have used it) for their own marketing purposes.

To exercise your rights, you may make one request each year by emailing us as set forth in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
