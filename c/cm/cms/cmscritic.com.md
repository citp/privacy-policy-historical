## How and Why we Track your Visit

Like most websites around the world we use Google [Analytics](https://www.cmscritic.com/clicky "Web Analytics in Real Time | Clicky") (GA) to process information about the number of visitors on our site, and their behavior

We use this information to record the number of people using CMS Critic and to better understand where you discover our site (from social media, google or another site) and how you use it as well as to see how people move throughout the site.

GA records your approximate location down to town level, the type device you are using e.g. Mobile or Table, Name of device e.g. iPad, iPhone etc…, operating system e.g. Windows 10 or iOS and browser e.g. Firefox or Chrome none of this data can be used to identify you.

Although this information is collected through your Google ad settings, it is not provided to us in a personally-identifiable format. This means we cannot identify what information is about you, and we will not try to figure it out.
