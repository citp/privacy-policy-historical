## How we collect and use data

We take the information you provide to us very seriously, and we strive to put you in control of decisions around your information. 

#### Capital Marketplace collects the following information about you and your use of our Properties:

  


#### Personal Information.

When you register for, browse and use our Properties, you may provide to Capital Marketplace what is generally called “personally identifiable information” or “personal data” (such as your full name, email address, phone number) that can be used to identify you. At Capital Marketplace, we call this data “Personal Information”.

#### Information from Integrated Services like Facebook or Google.

If you decide to register through or otherwise grant access to a third-party social networking or integrated s ervice (what we call an “Integrated Service”), such as Facebook Connect or Google, Capital Marketplace may also collect Personal Information that is already associated with your Integrated Service account. You may also have the option of sharing additional information with Capital Marketplace through an Integrated Service. If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, you are giving Capital Marketplace the permission to use, share, and store it in a manner consistent with this Privacy Notice.

#### Information about your use of our Properties and other User-provided Information.

We may collect usage information about your use of certain features on our Properties, such as your search results on our site, the number of jobs you have viewed, and the jobs that you applied for. This enables us to better tailor user experiences that are most appropriate for you.

#### Location Information.

We may collect and use information about your location (such as your country and/or state) to provide you with tailored information for your region, but we don’t collect the precise geolocation of you or your device. You may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with any location information.

#### Information from Other Sources.

In certain situations, we may obtain information, including Personal Information, from third parties or sources other than our Properties. For example, if you apply for a job with Capital Marketplace via an online recruiting site, we will obtain the information you provide in your application for that purpose. If we combine or associate information from other sources with Personal Information that we collect through our Properties, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Notice. 

  


#### Capital Marketplace uses this information in the following ways.

  


#### To enhance our Properties and the services we provide.

Capital Marketplace uses the information you provide or that we collect to enhance our relationship with you and to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on our Properties. Capital Marketplace, for instance, remembers your recent activity so we can recommend the most appropriate content for you on your next visit. If you have given Capital Marketplace consent, we may use your Personal Information to provide you with information about Capital Marketplace’s features, services and other offerings that may be of interest to you. Under certain circumstances and if we obtain your consent (for example, if you submit a testimonial and agree to make it public), we may post your Personal Information on our Properties.

#### To understand how you and other Users use our Properties.

Capital Marketplace uses all of the information that you provide or that we collect from Users to understand and analyze the usage trends, behaviors, and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Properties work and look, and to create new features and functionality. For more information, please see the “Technologies” section, below.

#### To enable your participation in Capital Marketplace partnership arrangements.

Khan Academy will not share Personal Information with other third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in. You can grant us permission to share your Personal Information with authorized partners, not-for-profit organizations, and other entities that are not affiliated with Capital Marketplace. In these cases, we will only provide to these third parties the information you have authorized or asked us to share to these third parties. Capital Marketplace may send information or offers to you on behalf of these third parties.

Unless we receive a deletion request, we will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as is reasonably useful for operational purposes.

#### Technical Information.

To provide personalized and high-quality experience for our Users, we may use various technologies that automatically record certain technical information from your browser or device, including standard log files, web beacons, or pixel tags. This technical information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, device or browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, clickstream data, operating system, and the dates and times that you visit the Website. We do this to better understand how our Users are using our Website so we can improve site functionality and the services we offer you. Like most websites, whether or not you are a registered member, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on a website and enable us to provide you with a more personalized experience. Capital Marketplace may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears automatically after you close your browser.

Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. However, without cookies you will not have access to certain services and features on the Website. Capital Marketplace uses a variety of third-party service providers, such as Google Analytics to understand our Website usage. We may allow third-party service providers to place and read their own cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect information through the Website. This information is collected directly and automatically by these third parties, and Capital Marketplace does not participate in these data transmissions. Capital Marketplace will, wherever feasible, contractually obligate our third-party service providers to abide by the terms of this Privacy Notice.

## Our approach to Data Security

  


#### Data security is important to you, and to us.

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. For example, we may ask you to provide certain Personal Information to confirm your identity, and we may require that you create and use a password to access certain parts of our Properties. You should create and maintain a strong password to help ensure the security of your account.

#### We try to ensure that our Properties and information sent to us are safe, but no security measures are perfect.

Capital Marketplace uses certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information and other information we maintain in connection with our Properties. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any or all of the information you transmit to Capital Marketplace, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Capital Marketplace makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. When you enter sensitive information, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or similar technologies. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

#### We will notify you electronically or via the Properties if Capital Marketplace experiences a data security incident that could affect you.

If we learn of a data security incident that compromises or appears to compromise your Personal Information, then we will attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice on our Properties if a data security incident occurs.
