# Exchange Privacy Policy

CME Group (the "Exchange" or "we") supports a policy of openness regarding the collection and use of our customers' personal information. We have adopted and implemented this privacy policy ("Policy") as part of our commitment to protecting your personal information from misuse. We encourage you to read this Policy to learn more about the ways we collect, use, disclose, and protect the information we gather from this web site (the "Site"). If you are not comfortable with any of the practices or policies described in this Policy, we ask that you discontinue use of our Site. Please be aware that we may periodically update or revise this Policy without notice. Accordingly, please check this Policy frequently for changes.

Please note that information gathered in connection with any services provided via the Site may be governed by separate terms and conditions including, but not limited to, Schedule (B) ("NYMEX ClearPort® Clearing Services") of the Exchange User License Agreement and the Exchange Rules (collectively referred to herein as "Other Terms"). In the event that you receive such services, you agree that those Other Terms shall supercede any conflicting terms contained in this Policy.

**COLLECTION OF INFORMATION**

In order to better serve your particular needs, the Exchange (and third parties working on the Exchange's behalf) may collect information from you while visiting our Site. Some of this information is collected automatically through various methods including, but not limited to cookies (see section below on cookies). The Exchange may also obtain information directly from you and, depending upon the nature of transactions you may conduct, from third party sources. We also collect anonymous information, which does not personally identify you, when you visit our Site. The anonymous information includes the pages you view on our Site, the search terms you enter into our search utility, your IP address and the operating system, browser software and Internet service provider you use.

In addition to the information automatically collected when you visit our Site, the Exchange collects personally identifiable information directly from you and, in some circumstances, from those individuals and/or entities you may authorize to act on your behalf. In addition, we may collect other required information in order to provide you with services tailored to your particular needs.

For example, you may be required to provide your name, address, birth date, phone number, credit card data, the last four digits of your social security number and your e-mail address in order to register for certain services. By learning a little about you, the Exchange delivers more relevant content and product offerings and thus offers you better services.

The Exchange may also collect personally identifiable information by monitoring the Site for the Exchange's own purposes (including, without limitation, for purposes of maintaining the functional and operational integrity of the Site and for purposes of complying with applicable laws and regulations), and not for your benefit. The Exchange reserves the right to cooperate fully with state, local, federal, and international legal, governmental and regulatory entities, authorities and officials in any investigation or governmental, legal or regulatory proceeding relating to any information collected and/or Site content (including personal or private electronic communication transmitted via the Site) or to any purported unlawful activities of any Site visitor.

We use a secure server and security protocol to safeguard information we collect from you. To help ensure the security of your personal and financial information that you submit to us via our Site (other than via an e-mail message), we use security software to encrypt the information before and during its transmission through the Internet. We allow information to be submitted for transmission only if your browser is compatible with our security software.

E-mail messages are not secure. Our security software does not encrypt e-mail messages.

As such, users must immediately change any initial passwords provided by the Exchange pursuant to any services provided via the Site.
