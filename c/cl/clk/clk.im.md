## **Clkim Website Privacy Policy**

Last Revised: May 25, 2018

Clkim, Ltd. (“Clkim”, “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of its clients and the users of its website and services (the “Services”).

Clkim shares this End-User information with its Clients, or with third-party platforms that may be accessible to its Clients.  Clients may also use the Clkim-supplied links to collect additional information or perform additional functions (such as firing a tracking pixel or displaying interstitial advertising); those functions are controlled by the Client, and Clkim does not receive any additional End-User information as a result of those choices. 

Clkim also offers domain proxy services to Clients, whereby Clkim purchases a website domain on their behalf and enables the Client to serve as operator of that domain. Clkim is not responsible for the content that Clients choose to display on their websites and has no knowledge as to their data collection practices. Clkim does not collect any data regarding visitors to websites that it owns pursuant to its domain proxy services.
