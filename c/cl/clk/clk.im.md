Capitalized terms which are not defined herein, shall have the meaning ascribed to them in our Terms of Use at <http://clkim.com/terms> ( **"TOU"** ), into which this Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference.

### **1.** ** _Your Consent (PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!)_**

### **2.** ** _Which information we may collect on our Users?_**

We may collect two types of data and information from our Users:

a. The first type of information is non-identifiable and anonymous information (“ **Non-personal Information** ”). **We are not aware of the identity of the User from whom we have collected the Non-personal Information.** Non-Personal Information is any unconcealed information which does not enable identification of an individual User, and which is available to us while such User is entering and/or using the Site or Services. Non-personal Information which is being gathered consists of technical information, behavioral information and aggregated information, and may contain, among other things, the activity of the User on the Site or Services, type of operating system, User's 'click-stream' or searches on the Site or Services, type and version of browser or device, keyboard language, screen resolution, internet connectivity, details regarding User traffic and advertising delivery, etc. With respect to URLs, we may collect the following metrics: time and date of creation, the applicable User Account, referring websites or services, history of sharing the URLs via third party sites or services (including Social Networks), etc.

b. The second type of information is individually identifiable information ( **“Personal Information** ”). **This information may identify an individual or may be of a private and/or sensitive nature**.

·Users of the Site or Services automatically provide their IP address (or Mac Address, as applicable) mainly for enhancing the User's experience and for geolocation and security purposes as further detailed below.

·Personal Information which is being gathered consists of any personal details provided consciously and voluntarily by the User. Users who are interested in opening an Account may be requested to provide the following details via the registration form: full name, e-mail and to choose a password.

·Alternatively, the User can open an Account and signup to the Services via existing third party accounts (e.g., Facebook) used by him/her (" **Social Network Account** "). In the event that a User registers to the Services through his/her existing Social Network Account, then such Social Network Account provides us with access to certain information about such User as is stored in the User’s Social Network Account, namely, certain public information (e.g. full name, email, user ID and any other information which the User made public) and/or any other information which is detailed and displayed to the User in the notice which appears during the "Log in" with such Social Network Account process. Please read carefully such notice in order to understand what information is available to Clkim via the Social Network Account. We may collect your login information and other relevant information necessary to enable us to access your Social Network Account (such as, Facebook UserID, User access token) in order to collect and/or store, to the extent legally permissible, your full name and e-mail. Other than the abovementioned information, we do not collect or store any other information made available to us through your Social Network Account. You hereby agree that such information will be stored even after the linkage to your Social Network Account expires, for any reason. 

·The following information may be gathered from the User directly by Online Payment Services in order to facilitate the transactions made available by the Services: e-mail, ID/SSN, payment information (i.e. bank account number, credit card or debit card numbers). THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION DESCRIBED ABOVE IS NOT COLLECTED BY THE COMPANY.

·Personal Information may also be collected from the details the User may provide in the Contact Form on the Site, which includes the User's e-mail address and free text. Furthermore, the User may optionally provide his/her full name. Additional information may be requested in the future.

For avoidance of doubt, any Non-Personal Information connected or linked to any Personal Information shall be deemed as Personal Information as long as such connection or linkage exists.
