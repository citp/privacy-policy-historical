                Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your
                information is collected and used. We believe that a full disclosure of our privacy policy is essential to our success and to your ongoing patronage. To make
                this Privacy Policy easy to find, we make it available on our home page and on every page where personally identifiable information may be voluntarily supplied or requested.
            </p>
			<p>
				This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected or submitted on ClassicCars.com (the "Site") or The ClassicCars.com Blog (the "Blog"). We may refer to
				both websites collectively as "sites" or "web properties" throughout our Privacy Policy.
			</p>

            <h3><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Information Collection and Use</h3>
            <p>The Collector Car Network, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on the Site and the Blog. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points for both web properties.</p>
            <p>
                In order to use certain features of the Site or the Blog, such as posting a comment or subscribing to email updates, you must complete a form in which you provide us with your contact
                information (such as your name and email address). We use this information to contact you about the services in which you have expressed interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may give you the option of providing basic demographic information such as income, gender, and education to us. We strongly encourage you to share this information with us so we can
                provide our community with a better, more useful experience on the Site and the Blog. Providing any such demographic information is entirely voluntary and is identified as such at the time of data collection.
            </p>
            <div class="pad20Clear"></div>
            <h3><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Surveys and Contests</h3>
            <p>
                From time to time we may offer you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on the Site or the Blog. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in
                these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address)
                and demographic information (such as your age and postal code).
            </p>
            <p>We use this information to gather feedback about our sites' features, notify contest winners, and/or to send participants an email newsletter.</p>
            <p>
                We may use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; any such company will be prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will
                not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice.
            </p>
            <div class="pad20Clear"></div>
			<h3><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Sharing and "Send to a Friend"</h3>
            <p>
                In an effort to foster community and conversation, we provide convenient links to major social networks throughout our sites. Each social network has its own privacy policy, which
                may differ significantly from ours. Your use of any social network is subject to its privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about the Site or the Blog, or post on the Blog, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will send
                your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to view a vehicle listing or visit the Blog. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and for tracking the success of our referral programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your friend may contact us using our <a href="/contactus">feedback page</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.

            <h3><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Communications from Us</h3>
			<p>
				If you disclose your email address to us, we will occasionally send you information on new Blog features, services, special deals, and promotions. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the
				option not to receive these types of communications. Please see "Choice and Opt-Out" below for more information.
			</p>
            <p>
                If you wish to subscribe to our email newsletters, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe with each newsletter we send.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we may send you a welcoming email and/or a confirmation email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response
                to your inquiries, to provide specific services you request, and to manage any other feature or service under which you are identified by your email address. We will communicate with you by email and/or telephone, in
                accordance with your wishes.

            <p>
                We may store information that we collect through cookies, server log files, tracking images, and third party sources to create a profile of your preferences. We may tie your personally identifiable information
                to information in the profile in order to provide you with tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the Blog for you.
            </p>
            <div class="pad20Clear"></div>
            <h3><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
            <p>
                We share aggregated demographic information about our visitors with our partners, affiliates, and advertisers. This information does not identify individual users; rather, it provides our partners,
                affiliates, and advertisers with a description of our user base as a whole. Partners may include third parties with whom we have or may have a business relationship, such as sponsors.
            </p>
            <p>
                We share personally identifiable information with select third parties:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Email service providers.</b> We use third parties to provide email delivery services. When you sign up for a newsletter, subscribe to a feed, or otherwise provide your email address, we will share
                    your email address and certain elements of your profile as necessary with the appropriate service provider for the sole purpose of providing that service.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Infrastructure providers.</b> We use third parties to host the Blog and keep it maintained and backed up. Personally identifiable information we store on third-party systems and networks is
                    always under our control and access to it is secured in a manner consistent with good information technology practices and procedures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Fulfillment providers.</b> We use third parties to manage, ship and deliver any physical goods which we may, from time to time, give away or offer for sale. Any personally identifiable information, such
                    as your name and address, will be used by these service providers solely for the purpose of fulfilling orders and delivering goods.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="pad20Clear"></div>
            <h3><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial
                proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us.
            </p>
            <div class="pad20Clear"></div>
            <h3><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choice and Opt-Out</h3>
            <p>
                We provide you with the opportunity to opt out of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. For example, if you register for an
                account with us but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our registration form.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication.  Any such opt-out
                instructions may take up to ten (10) working days to process, during which time you may continue to receive newsletters and promotional communications.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent or service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.
            </p>
            <div class="pad20Clear"></div>
            <h3><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Log Files and Analytics</h3>
            <p>
                As is typical of professionally managed websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser
                type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data for each visitor to the Site or the Blog.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site and the Blog, to track visitors' movements around our web properties, and to
                gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally, we do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are, however, tied to personally identifiable information in conjunction
                with certain features such as comments in order to help protect our community from spam.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use third-party tracking services that use cookies and tracking images called beacons to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors in the aggregate. We use this information
                to supplement the information we gather from analyzing our log files.
            </p>
            <div class="pad20Clear"></div>
            <h3><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We do not store any personally identifiable information in cookies, but we may link the information
                we store in cookies to personally identifiable information when required for technical reasons, such as in keeping track of your comments.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our web properties. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent
                cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's documentation. More information about
                cookies can be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_blank">Wikipedia.</a>

				This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by The Collector Car Network, Inc. only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers or other third parties. Some of our business

            <h3><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracking Graphics</h3>
			<p>
				We and/or our third-party partners employ a software technology called tracking graphics (a.k.a. "Web beacons" or "Web bugs") that help us better manage content on our sites by informing us what content
				is effective. Tracking graphics are tiny, transparent images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which
				are stored on a user's computer hard drive, tracking graphics are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. As with cookies, we may tie the information
				gathered by tracking graphics to our customers' personally identifiable information.
			</p>
            <p>
                We use tracking graphics in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness
                of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt out of these emails, you may do so by following the instructions included in every such communication.

				Some of the ads appearing on our websites are delivered to users by one or more advertising partners. We
				may share aggregate website usage information about users with reputable third parties for the purpose of
				targeting our Internet banner advertisements on our websites. Additionally, these companies may use
				information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods
				and services of interest to you. Third party advertisers may use cookies and/or tracking graphics,
				allowing them to recognize a user when a user visits the website. The information that such companies
				collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable, nor is it under our control. If
				you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this
