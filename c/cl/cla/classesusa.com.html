		<strong>COOKIES AND WEB BUGS</strong>
		<br>
		A cookie is a small piece of information that many Web sites use to
		help make shopping online easier. The information is stored on your
		computer's hard drive and provides a number of conveniences for you.
		We may set and access cookies on your computer to provide you with
		customized content and to assist in providing the services that you
		have requested. Most cookies are "session cookies," which
		automatically delete themselves from your hard drive after each
		session. Like many Web sites, We may automatically track information
		based upon your behavior on Our Web sites. We may combine information
		that We obtain through the use of cookies with Personal Information,
		other aggregate or anonymous data, including a unique ID We may assign
		you. As described above, We use this information for research purposes
		to better understand, protect and service Our customers. The
		information We track may include such information as browser type,
		Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type,
		date/time stamp, IP address and number of clicks to analyze trends,
		administer Our Web sites, track user's movement in the aggregate, and
		gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO OTHER WEB SITES?</strong>
		<br>
		Our Web site may contain links to other Web sites. We believe such
		other Web sites share a similar commitment to consumer privacy and
		urge you to review their privacy policy when visiting their Web sites.
		We are not responsible for the privacy policies of other Web sites.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?</strong>
		<br>
		We maintain electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect
		your Information. We protect Information about you over the Internet
		by using a secure web server, which allows web browser programs (such
		as Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer) to interact with Our web
		server via an encrypted session. We employ a Secure Sockets Layer
		(SSL) connection that provides an encrypted connection between your
		computer and Us. The 128 bit encrypted connection scrambles ordinary
		text or data into cyphertext to safeguard sensitive information during
		its journey across the Internet. The information is decrypted, or put
		back into a readable format, when it reaches its intended destination.
		Depending on which browser you use, you will know you are in secured
		area by "https" or a lock appearing in the lower right hand corner of
		your browser window. When you visit Our Web site, you may move in and
		out of secured areas.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>DATA TRANSFER</strong>
		<br>
		We may store, process and/or transfer personal data to countries outside 
		of the United States of America and, by using Our products and services, 
		you consent to such transfer. For example, if you elect to submit your 
		Personal Information to a Canadian school, We may transfer your Personal 
		Information across borders to the Canadian schools that you selected. 
		We may also store, process and/or transfer personal data to the United 
		States of America and, by using Our products and services, you consent to 
		such transfer. For example, if you elect to submit your Personal Information 
		to the site, We will transfer and process your Personal Information across 
		borders, specifically, the United States of America, and this information 
		may be accessed by the courts, law enforcement and national security 
		authorities of that jurisdiction.
	</p>
	<p>
		Canadian Consumers: We will comply with existing local, provincial and federal 
		Canadian law, including but not limited to the Personal Protection and Electronic 
		Documents Act ("PIPEDA"), and We will adhere to the Fair Information Principles, 
		reflected within PIPEDA and provincial regulations.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>A SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING PEOPLE UNDER 18 YEARS OLD</strong>

		Individuals under the age of eighteen (18) should not send any
		Information to Us. Each time you access Our Web site or purchase a
		product or service from Us, or provide Information about yourself or
		anyone else, you are representing to Us that you are eighteen (18)
