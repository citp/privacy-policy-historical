## WHY WE COLLECT INFORMATION

We collect personal information because it helps us deliver Products and services. For example, if you order a Product, we need to have information such as your billing address, age, Product choice, delivery information, and payment processing information. In addition, your personal information helps us communicate to you latest Products, special offers, and information and events about which you might like to hear.

We also collect your personal information to help us design and deliver Site operations, and to deliver targeted advertisements to you. We also may correlate your personal information obtained from you with information from other sources, which may help us to develop a more targeted user profile concerning you and/or your demographic information. For example, if you provide us with your personal information, we may cross-check that against information that might be otherwise available through other entities with whom we have business relationships in order to develop a more in-depth demographic profile of you. Similarly, we may process personal information to target specific items of interest to you. We know that everyone is busy, and nobody likes their email cluttered up with junk mail and as such we will only send you marketing messages if you choose to receive them from us. If you decide that you no longer want to receive our emails you can unsubscribe at any time by clicking and selecting 'Unsubscribe'.

## WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT

The following generally describes the type of information we may collect about you. 

Those who wish to communicate with us but do not wish to provide personally identifiable information online may contact us through the address or phone numbers provided on our website. However, you should note that if you contact us by phone, or if you contact us via postal mail, you may still be submitting personally identifiable information to us. For example, if you have a listed phone number without blocking, your phone number may appear to us when you call. Similarly, if you write to us and provide a name and return address, we will gather that information in order to communicate with you, and we may use the information in accordance with this privacy policy.

This information allows us to see which areas of the Site are most visited and helps us better understand the user experience. This helps us improve quality by recognising and delivering more of the features, areas, and services our visitors prefer. In this process of gathering information, we may collect for example, domain type, browser type and version, service provider and IP address, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click-stream data).

3\. We collect information from other sources: We may obtain information about you from outside sources. For example, we may obtain commercially available information about you from third parties, such as demographic information for advertising and marketing purposes.
