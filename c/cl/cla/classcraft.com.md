# Classcraft | Classcraft Studios Inc. Privacy Policy

Classcraft Studios Inc. (“Classcraft”) takes the privacy of its students and teachers seriously. Classcraft is committed to protecting users’ privacy while providing a personalized and valuable learning experience.

Classcraft has developed this Privacy Policy to let users know in general terms about Classcraft’s personal information management practices, including what personal information is collected and how it is processed and used. If users have any questions about our Privacy Policy, they may contact Classcraft at [wecare@classcraft.com](mailto:wecare@classcraft.com).

## The School Environment

As Classcraft is designed to be played in groups, much of the information collected about the teachers and students is intended to be shared. Classcraft stores the following information that the teacher and students may choose to share with their class, colleagues, or school administration:

  * Student or teacher’s name;
  * Student or teacher’s email address;
  * Student or teacher’s game activities;
  * School and class information;
  * Postings in forums;
  * Homework assignments; and
  * Messages.



It is understood that the teacher is both the Gamemaster and the teacher and that all game-related or class-related information or communications are not private within the classroom and school environment (“School Environment”). The sharing of the above information is therefore also subject to the privacy policies of the relevant educational institutions. If users have any questions about the sharing of this information, Classcraft would recommend that users contact the relevant educational institutions.

Classcraft has taken all precautions to make sure that this data will not be shared outside the School Environment except as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
