# Classcraft - Privacy Policy

Classcraft Studios Inc. ("Classcraft") takes the privacy of its students, teachers and parents seriously. Classcraft is committed to protecting users’ privacy while providing a personalized and valuable learning experience.

Classcraft has taken the [Student Privacy Pledge](https://studentprivacypledge.org/) as a public commitment for the responsible collection and use of student data. Among other things, we have committed to only collect student information that is needed for authorized education/school purposes, or as authorized by the parent/student, to not sell student personal information, to not use student information for behavioral targeting of advertisements to students and to not retain student personal information beyond the time period required to support the authorized educational/school purposes. The complete Student Privacy Pledge can be read at [studentprivacypledge.org](https://studentprivacypledge.org/).

Classcraft has developed this Privacy Policy to let users know in general terms about Classcraft’s personal information management practices, including what personal information is collected and how it is processed and used. If users have any questions about our Privacy Policy they may contact Classcraft at [support@classcraft.com](mailto:support@classcraft.com).

## The School Environment

As Classcraft is designed to be played in groups, much of the information collected about the teachers and students is intended to be shared. Classcraft stores the following information that the teacher and students may choose to share with their class, colleagues or school administration:

  * Student or teacher’s name;
  * Student or teacher’s email address;
  * Student or teacher’s game activities;
  * School and class information;
  * Teacher-generated content (for example: posts, assignments, quizzes, etc.);
  * Messages and comments within the game.



It is understood that the teacher is both the game master and the teacher and that game related or class related activities, information or communications may be visible to teachers, students and others who are physically in the classroom. Furthermore, some information will be available to other teachers and school or district administrations (see "Classcraft User Access Privileges" below). Collectively, the classroom, teachers, and school and district administration are referred to in the document as the School Environment. The sharing of the above information is therefore also subject to the privacy policies of the relevant educational institutions. If users have any questions about the sharing of this information Classcraft would recommend that users contact the relevant educational institutions.

Classcraft has taken all precautions to make sure that this data will not be shared outside the School Environment except as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## What Does Classcraft Do With the Collected Information?

Collected information is used for the following purposes:

  * To allow the teacher to manage and play the game;
  * To allow classmates to play the game;
  * To enable class related activities such as classroom content, assignments, and communications;
  * To allow parents to play the game with their child(ren);
  * To allow teachers, students and parents to compare individual student performance against aggregate results from within that student’s class;
  * For software support purposes;
  * For billing purposes, and
  * For marketing purposes (teachers and parents only).



Classcraft does not share personally identifiable information outside the School Environment, except for those purposes stated within this document, without first obtaining the express written consent of the individual.

By default, students can see game events for other students in their class from within their account. The teacher can restrain the information visible to other students: on a per class basis, they can hide the reasons for gaining and losing points and also limit visibility to a student’s teammates only (for the purpose of being able to play the game).

Parents who login to the game are not granted access to personally identifiable information of any student other than their child.

Collected information in aggregate form, whereby individual users are not identifiable, is used for the following purposes:

  * For statistical purposes;
  * For research;
  * For strategic development and business management;
  * For marketing purposes related to Classcraft; and
  * For customer support purposes.



## Classcraft User Access Privileges

Teachers are granted access to student data for the students in their classes and to parent data for the students in their classes. With the multiclass option, teachers from the same school can see the name, username and character class of students who are in classes that are linked to theirs, but do not have access to other student information outside of their own class. The school administrators may also have access to this data.

Students are granted access to their personal data, their team game play data, all content posted by their teacher in the classroom content system, comments of other students in the classroom content system, as well as any data that is displayed by the teacher in front of the whole class. By default, students can see game events for other students in their class from within their account. The teacher can restrain the information visible to other students: on a per class basis, they can hide the reasons for gaining and losing points and also limit visibility to a student’s teammates only (for the purpose of being able to play the game).

Parents are granted access to data related to their child, their child’s teacher and to aggregate data for their child’s class.

Postings in the teacher forums include the teacher name and photo and are available publicly. Postings to the teacher forums should not be considered private communications.

## Student Records

Student records are the property of and under the control of the school, school district and/or the teacher. Students can access their student records by logging in to their student account. Parents of students under the age of 18 can access their child’s information via the parent account, by logging in using their child’s account, by contacting the teacher or by contacting Classcraft at [support@classcraft.com](mailto:support@classcraft.com). Corrections of any erroneous information should first be brought to the attention of the teacher. In the event that the teacher is unable to make the correction, parents should advise Classcraft at [support@classcraft.com](mailto:support@classcraft.com), who will then work with the teacher or school to facilitate correction of any erroneous information.

Third parties are not granted access to personally identifiable information or educational records or other student records except as provided in this Privacy Policy, or after first obtaining the express written consent of the parent or student over 18 years of age. No parties, including Classcraft, will be allowed to engage in targeted advertising of any sort directed towards the students.

Should there be any unauthorized disclosure of a student’s records, Classcraft will notify the teacher, parent and student via email within 3 days following discovery of the unauthorized disclosure.

## Deletion of Student Records

The following student records are retained for a period of no more than 12 months after the last entry was made to the student account in the game:

  * Student game play information, such as XP, HP, AP, GP, and all related data including dates, descriptions, and point values;
  * Student behavioural analytics, including points, descriptions and dates;
  * Student assignments and all comments and posts by the student in the classroom content system; and
  * Any other student information that may not be used by the student in future years.



Student avatars and pets, along with the student account information are retained for a period of no more than 36 months following the last entry made to the student account in the game. This is because students playing Classcraft in subsequent years will still have access to their avatars and pets during those future classes, to a maximum of 36 months. Parents and students over the age of 18 can request to have their account, or the account of their child, and related information deleted from the Classcraft database by advising Classcraft at [support@classcraft.com](mailto:support@classcraft.com).

## Deletion of Parent and Teacher Records

Parent records will be retained for a period of no more than 36 months following the last entry made to one of their children’s student accounts. This time period has been selected to facilitate streamlined registration for Classcraft throughout their child’s education.

Personal data of teachers and any data not already deleted that is related to a teacher’s classes will be deleted 5 years after their account has become inactive.

## FERPA

FERPA is an acronym for the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, a US federal law to protect the privacy of student educational records. While this act is primarily directed towards educational institutions, Classcraft’s privacy policy is designed to secure student data in compliance with FERPA and to allow education institutions using Classcraft to be compliant with FERPA.

## COPPA

COPPA is an acronym for the Child Online Privacy Protection Act, a US federal law to protect the privacy of children under the age of 13. Under the licensing agreement between Classcraft and the teachers using the Classcraft software, the teachers are responsible for obtaining parental permission should it be required under COPPA. Classcraft does provide information for teachers along with a sample parental permission document should they require one. This is available at https://help.classcraft.com/hc/en-us/articles/218411437-Classcraft-and-COPPA.

## Security Policy

Classcraft uses industry standard methods to protect its customer’s data against unauthorized use or access, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction or loss. It should however be noted that 100% guarantee cannot be made due to constant advances in virus and hacking technology. Classcraft can therefore not be held responsible for data loss or alteration. A full copy of the Classcraft Security Policy can be obtained upon request to [support@classcraft.com](mailto:support@classcraft.com).

## Links and Third Party Integration

Classcraft websites may contain links to other websites. Classcraft tries to only link to websites that share Classcraft’s high standards of decency, fairness and integrity. Classcraft tries to make sure that these links are safe for everyone, but the privacy and data collection practices on any linked websites are entirely separate from Classcraft and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Other websites, which may contain material not suitable for children, may also link to Classcraft websites without Classcraft’s knowledge or consent. Classcraft does not necessarily endorse any outside websites and Classcraft has no responsibility for the content, policies or actions of these websites.

Third Party software may be integrated with Classcraft (such as Google Classroom, Microsoft, Facebook or Twitter). Classcraft has no responsibility for the content, policies or actions of these websites and they are entirely separate from Classcraft and are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

## Classroom Content

Teachers and students may make postings in various sections of Classcraft. Common examples of this would be links to videos hosted by YouTube or Vimeo, links to Wikipedia or other reference material, and so on. It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that this content is appropriate and free from links to sites which may compromise the privacy of their students. Classcraft does not monitor the classroom content and has no responsibility for this content. The Classcraft software has features within it to allow teachers to monitor and control all content posted by the students in their class. Furthermore, students may flag inappropriate comments from within Classcraft and their teacher will be automatically notified.

## Change of Control

This Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this policy (unless you give consent to a new policy). We will provide you with notice of an acquisition within thirty (30) days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, or by email to your email address that you provided to us.

## Disclosure of Information to Satisfy Legal Obligations

Classcraft may disclose personal information if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process. We may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to to protect the rights, property, or safety of Classcraft, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our our Terms of Service or other agreements. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection or responding to government requests.

## Changes and Updates to the Privacy Policy

Should we make modifications to this policy or the related User Agreements, we’ll post a notice that you will receive when you login to the game and/or we will send an email directly to you with a copy of the new documents. Classcraft’s updated Privacy Policy and User Agreements will also be posted on Classcraft’s public facing website.
