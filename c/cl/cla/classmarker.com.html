automatically collected with other information that we have collected
about you.</p>
<p>You may browse and use certain portions of our Site without directly

</ul>
<a id="_Cookies_and_other"></a>
<h3>4. Cookies and other tracking mechanisms</h3>
<p>We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track your use of our Site or Services.</p>
<ul class="star">
<li><strong>Cookies.</strong> We or our service providers may use cookies to track visitor activity on
our Site. A cookie is a text file that a website transfers to your computer's hard drive for
record-keeping purposes. We or our service providers may use cookies to track user activities
on our Site, such as the pages visited and time spent on our Site. Most browsers allow users
to refuse cookies. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to
prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when
you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Users who disable cookies
may not be able to browse certain areas of the Site.</li>
<li><strong>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</strong> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics
with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are embedded invisibly on web
pages. We or our service providers may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or
pixel tags), in connection with our Site to track the activities of visitors to our Site, help
us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Site. We or our service providers
may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our users, to help us track email response rates, identify
when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.</li>
<li><strong>Local Storage Objects.</strong> We may use Flash Local Storage Objects ("Flash LSOs”)
to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser
cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or
disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs,
or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page,
choose "Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently
on your computer, choose "Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions to review and,
if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.</li>
</ul>
<a id="_California_Do_Not"></a>
<h3>5. California Do Not Track disclosure</h3>
<p>While there is still no universally accepted standard regarding tracking, our Site does respond
to certain <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/dnt/" class="popup">Do Not Track</a>
signals (e.g., the Mozilla Firefox Do Not Track feature). You may also
disable certain tracking as discussed above (e.g., by disabling cookies) though doing so may mean
that certain Site functionality will be lost (e.g., staying logged into the Site).
For more information about tracking, please click <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com/" class="popup">here</a>.</p>
<a id="_California_Do_Not_1"></a>
<h3>6. Third-party analytics</h3>
<p>We use service providers, such as
<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" class="popup">Google Analytics demographics
and interests reports as well as advertising reporting features</a>
, to evaluate the use of our Site and our Services. We or our
service providers use automated devices and applications to evaluate use of our Site and Services.
We or our service providers use these tools to help us improve our Site, Services, performance, and
user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons
or Flash LSO, to perform their services. To opt out of Google Analytics, go
<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" class="popup">here</a>.</p>
<a id="_Interest_based_advertising"></a>
<h3>7. Interest-based advertising </h3>
<p>We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Site and on third-party
websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these third parties to
target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad
network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript,
web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the
effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies
and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. </p>
<p>Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the
Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA”)
<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" class="popup">Consumer Choice Page</a>
for information about opting out of
interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by
<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/participating/" class="popup">DAA companies</a>.
You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI”)
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" class="popup">Consumer Opt-Out Page</a>
for information
about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/participating-networks" class="popup">NAI members</a>.</p>
<p>Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA
<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" class="popup">Consumer Choice Page</a>
or the NAI
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" class="popup">Consumer Opt-Out Page</a>
will opt you out from those companies' delivery of interest-based
content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through
our Site or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on
the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers
are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not
be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA's website at
<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" class="popup">www.aboutads.info</a>
or the
NAI's website at
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" class="popup">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>
<a id="_User_generated_content"></a>
<h3>8. User-generated content</h3>
<p>Note that if you post information in a publicly accessible portion of our Site or Service, it may be
viewed by other users and potentially be further disclosed by those users. Please exercise caution
when deciding to disclose such information.</p>
<a id="_Security"></a>
<h3>9. Security</h3>
<p>We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access,
modification or disclosure. For example, we take steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal
information if we no longer need it for any purpose. Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data
security measures can guarantee 100% security.</p>
<p>If you have an account with us, you should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your
account by, among other things, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess
and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or
compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.</p>
<a id="_Your_choices"></a>
<h3>10. Your choices</h3>
<p>We take reasonable steps to ensure the personal information that ClassMarker collects, uses or
discloses is accurate, complete and up-to-date. You may modify your personal information by
updating your account on our Site or through our
<a href="/online-testing/contact-us" title="contacts page">Contact Us</a>
page on the Site. On request, we
will give you access to the personal information we hold about you. If any personal information
we hold about you is out of date or inaccurate, we encourage you to let us know by contacting us
using one of the methods listed above and ask us to correct it.</p>
<p>
We may send, with your prior consent, periodic promotional or informational emails to you. You may
opt out of such communications at any time by following the opt-out instructions contained in the
email. Please note that it may take up to five (5) business days for us to process opt-out requests.
If you opt out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest
you, we may still send you emails about your account or any Services you have requested or received
from us provided that you have not opted-out of receiving such emails.</p>
<a id="_Consent_to_transfer"></a>
<h3>11. Consent to transfer personal information</h3>
<p>Please note that your personal information may be transferred outside the country in which you are
located, including to United States of America. By using our Services, you consent to the transfer
and processing of your information in a jurisdiction that may not have the same level of data
protection as your home country. You are entirely free not to consent by not using our Service.
However, if you do not consent, then we may not be able to provide you with our Services.</p>
<a id="_Children"></a>

<p>Our Site is not targeted to children under thirteen (13) years of age nor do we knowingly collect
personal information from children under thirteen (13). If we discover that a child under thirteen (13)
data is in the system without adult consent, we will promptly delete such personal information from our
systems. We encourage children under thirteen (13) to obtain their parent's or guardian's permission
before sharing personal information with any website.</p>
