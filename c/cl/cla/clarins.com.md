## Cookies, Web Beacons and Log Files

An IP address is a number designated for your computer by your Internet service provider to provide access to the Internet. Generally, an IP address will change every time your computer connects to the Internet. However, with some broadband connections, it is possible that the IP address assigned to your service may be static. In some cases, when combined with other information linked to an IP address, from across the Internet or that is held by other organizations with which a user might deal, that an Internet service account holder could be identified through their IP address – particularly if it is a static address. Clarins may use your IP address to gather aggregate information respecting your use of the Site; however, we will only be able to identify you individually if we have the means of linking your IP address to you as a particular user. This usually requires access to additional information which we do not seek.

When you view our Site we, or advertising and analytics companies that we may retain, may store information on the hard drive of your computer, tablet or mobile device in the form of a "cookie" Cookies are small text files stored on your device that identify your browser/IP address – but not you as a named individual – to our computers each time you visit our Site or other sites on the web. Cookies do not allow us access to the rest of your computer. More information about cookies can be found at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie>.

Cookies allow us to tailor our Site to your interests and preferences. For example, a cookie might contain information about the web pages you have visited on the Site, which could allow us to customise your next visit to the websites. We may also use cookies to collect aggregated statistical information. Most Internet browsers enable you to delete cookies or to receive a warning before a cookie is stored on your hard drive. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about how to do this. However, should you decide to disable any cookies we place on your computer you may not be able to use certain services or facilities on the Site.

In order to analyse the success of our marketing campaigns, we also implement other technologies such as web beacons. A [web beacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacon) is a small transparent graphic image that allows us to record simple user actions related to our Site and to email communications received from us, which assist us in determining the usage and effectiveness of our Site and communications. These “images” are automatically loaded to your browser/device when you visit the Site or open an html format email message from us, thereby letting us know if a certain page was visited or an email message was opened.

Log files are records of all visits to our Site, which are automatically generated by our servers or Site hosts. Our server creates log files of information such as the IP address from your network, what pages were explored and the length of your visit. This information is not used to develop a personal profile of you; rather, we study visitor trends since we are interested in the successful dissemination of information through the Site. Analysis software is used to generate reports, consisting of aggregated information, which help us to learn more about how we can enhance your experience with the Site. The log files are regularly purged.

They will govern the use of Personal Information you submit whilst visiting these websites.

## Retention and Storage

Other safeguards include physical measures (such as locked filing cabinets and restricted access to offices), organizational measures (such as security clearances and limiting access to a “need-to-know” basis) and technological measures (such as the use of passwords and encryption).
