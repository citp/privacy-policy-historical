At Clark, we understand that issues surrounding personal privacy and the Internet are a major concern. We are committed to protecting the rights of all our visitors and want to share with you how we gather information to improve our pages. 

**Collection of On-line Information For Web Statistics**

We want to assure you as you explore our site that we do not collect any sensitive data that you would not want us to know without consent. We only acquire personal information you submit through e-mail or written correspondence. 

The information we track includes the number of visitors we receive to certain pages, the country from where the user is connecting, the browser being used, keywords from search engines and links from on-line directories used to find us. 

The information we do record helps us analyze the traffic to various sections of our site and aids us in site development. Our goal is to use this data to continue to make the site easy to navigate with content that meets the needs of our visitors.

**Regarding E-mail**

We only publish e-mail addresses of Clark alumni and students who tell us that they wish to post this information. For those who do provide us with their address for publication on the Web, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information about Clark or upcoming campus events.

We reserve the right to publish e-mail addresses of Clark faculty, administration, and staff at our discretion to better serve the academic community, parents, and prospective students.
