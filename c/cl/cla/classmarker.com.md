Where you consent, we may provide you with news and newsletters, special offers, and promotions; to contact you about products or information we think may interest you; and for other marketing, advertising, and promotional purposes provided that you have not opted-out of receiving such communications.

  * **Aggregate and De-Identified Information.** Where permitted by law, we may disclose aggregate, anonymous, or de-identified information about users for marketing, advertising, research, or other purposes.



### 4\. Cookies and other tracking mechanisms

We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track your use of our Site or Services.

  * **Cookies.** We or our service providers may use cookies to track visitor activity on our Site. A cookie is a text file that a website transfers to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We or our service providers may use cookies to track user activities on our Site, such as the pages visited and time spent on our Site. Most browsers allow users to refuse cookies. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Users who disable cookies may not be able to browse certain areas of the Site.
  * **Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.** Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are embedded invisibly on web pages. We or our service providers may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to track the activities of visitors to our Site, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Site. We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our users, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
  * **Local Storage Objects.** We may use Flash Local Storage Objects ("Flash LSOs”) to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose "Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose "Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.



### 5\. California Do Not Track disclosure

While there is still no universally accepted standard regarding tracking, our Site does respond to certain [Do Not Track](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/dnt/) signals (e.g., the Mozilla Firefox Do Not Track feature). You may also disable certain tracking as discussed above (e.g., by disabling cookies) though doing so may mean that certain Site functionality will be lost (e.g., staying logged into the Site). For more information about tracking, please click [here](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

### 6\. Third-party analytics

We use service providers, such as [Google Analytics demographics and interests reports as well as advertising reporting features](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/), to evaluate the use of our Site and our Services. We or our service providers use automated devices and applications to evaluate use of our Site and Services. We or our service providers use these tools to help us improve our Site, Services, performance, and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or Flash LSO, to perform their services. To opt out of Google Analytics, go [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

### 7\. Interest-based advertising 

We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Site and on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. 

Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA”) [Consumer Choice Page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by [DAA companies](http://www.aboutads.info/participating/). You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI”) [Consumer Opt-Out Page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by [NAI members](http://www.networkadvertising.org/participating-networks).

Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA [Consumer Choice Page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or the NAI [Consumer Opt-Out Page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) will opt you out from those companies' delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA's website at [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) or the NAI's website at [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

### 8\. User-generated content

Note that if you post information in a publicly accessible portion of our Site or Service, it may be viewed by other users and potentially be further disclosed by those users. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose such information.

### 9\. Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. For example, we take steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if we no longer need it for any purpose. Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.

If you have an account with us, you should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your account by, among other things, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

### 10\. Your choices

We take reasonable steps to ensure the personal information that ClassMarker collects, uses or discloses is accurate, complete and up-to-date. You may modify your personal information by updating your account on our Site or through our [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/online-testing/contact-us "contacts page") page on the Site. On request, we will give you access to the personal information we hold about you. If any personal information we hold about you is out of date or inaccurate, we encourage you to let us know by contacting us using one of the methods listed above and ask us to correct it.

If you are a registered user, we may send, (with your prior consent if you are outside the EU), periodic informational emails to you. You may opt out of such communications at any time by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to five (5) business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your account or any Services you have requested or received from us provided that you have not opted-out of receiving such emails.

### 11\. Consent to transfer personal information

Please note that your personal information may be transferred outside the country in which you are located, including to United States of America. By using our Services, you consent to the transfer and processing of your information in a jurisdiction that may not have the same level of data protection as your home country. You are entirely free not to consent by not using our Service. However, if you do not consent, then we may not be able to provide you with our Services.

### 12\. Children

Our Site is not targeted to children under thirteen (13) years of age (sixteen (16) for EU residents unless provided otherwise by applicable law) nor do we knowingly collect personal information from children under thirteen (13) (sixteen (16) for EU residents unless provided otherwise by applicable law). If we discover that a child under thirteen (13) (sixteen (16) for EU residents unless provided otherwise by applicable law) data is in the system without adult consent, we will promptly delete such personal information from our systems. We encourage children under thirteen (13) (sixteen (16) for EU residents unless provided otherwise by applicable law) to obtain their parent's or guardian's permission before sharing personal information with any website.

### 13\. External links

This Site contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the information handling practices or content of these external websites. Please ensure that you read the Terms and Conditions and privacy policies of these third parties before using such websites.

### 14\. EU Residents

The Services are offered and provided on the Site to organisations (“Customers”) that wish to test their employees, students or agents, or provide them with pre-registered ID code, in order to use our Services (“Users”). We process the personal data of Users on behalf of our Customers, pursuant to instructions issued by our Customers, and the terms of our agreements with them. Users resident in the EU are not considered to have agreed to this Policy because the basis for processing their information is the performance of the Terms and Conditions we conclude with you or our contract with our Customers. The processing of data of Users located in the EU will be conducted consistent with the terms of this Policy and the data protection notice of the relevant Customer. We encourage you to contact the organisation that registered you for the Services for more information.
