# Creative Loafing Atlanta | Privacy Policy

**Creative Loafing Media** collects aggregate information site-wide, including anonymous site statistics. We also log domain names and/or IP addresses. This information is used primarily to discover which features users are reading the most, what features they like best and what we can do to make things better.

We also may analyze the aggregated information and share that data with advertisers (for example, we might track how many users see and click on a particular advertisement).

On certain pages—for participation in our contests, games, subscription registrations, comment forums—we may ask users for names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, e-mail address, and demographic and/or personal information. This information is only gathered with the users' consent.

We will not share any user's personal information with any other organization, nor will we publish such information, unless we have your consent, are under a legal order to do so, or there is an emergency involving personal danger.

Please note that if a user gives out personal information online —for example, through a comment posting— that information can be collected and used by third parties. Although we strive to protect our users' privacy, Creative Loafing Media cannot guarantee the security of information users post in these forums. A user is disclosing such information at his or her own risk.

This policy has been developed with the understanding that the Internet is rapidly changing and evolving. Guidelines are subject to change. The changes will be posted here.

**Creative Loafing Media** is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of websites to which [clatl.com](http://clatl.com/) may link.
