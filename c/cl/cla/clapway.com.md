# Privacy Policy - Clapway

CLAPWAY.COM has adopted this Privacy Policy in order to inform you of its policies with respect to information collected from the [http://clapway.com](http://clapway.com/) online and mobile web sites (each, a “Web Site” or collectively, the “Web Sites”).

  * What information we collect and why we collect it.
  * How we use that information.
  * The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.



If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:  **CLAPWAY@GMAIL.COM**.

Personally Identifiable Information is any information that concerns you individually and would permit someone to contact you, for example, your name, address, telephone/fax number, email address or any information you submit to the Web Sites that identifies you individually.

The Web Sites will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it.

Therefore, if you do not want us to obtain any personally identifiable information about you, please do not submit it to us.

You can visit and browse the Web Sites without revealing personally identifiable information about yourself, but not all functions will be available to you. You may also choose to disclose personally identifiable information about yourself, which may be maintained as described below. The Web Sites may collect personally identifiable information about you by methods such as the following:

  * Registration Forms – If you are offered the opportunity to enter a promotion, to become a member of the Web Sites, or to register, you must fill out certain registration forms on the Web Site. This requires you to fill out the registration form on the Web Site. This form requires certain personally identifiable information that may include, without limitation, your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, areas of interest, product usage, credit/debit card number(s) with associated expiration date(s), CVV and billing zip code(s), and/or a unique individual password.
  * Transactions and Activity – If you become a registered user or if you conduct transactions through the Web Sites, we will collect information about the transactions you engage in while on the Web Sites and your other activity on the Web Sites or Applications. This information may include, without limitation, areas of the Web Sites that you visit, transaction type, content that you view, download or submit, transaction amount, payment, and billing information as well as the nature, quantity and price of the goods or services you exchange and the individuals or entities with whom you communicate or transact business.
  * Email and other voluntary communications – You may also choose to communicate with us through email, via our Web Sites, by telephone, in writing, or through other means. We collect the information in these communications, and such information may be personally identifiable.



When you visit the Clapway Web Sites, like when you visit most other web sites and applications, certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically logged, which may include information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the internet (which identifies the company providing you internet access and general geographic information), the date and time you access the site, the pages you access while at the Clapway Web Sites or Application, and the internet address of the web sites, if any, from which you linked directly to the Clapway Web Site or Application. This information is not personally identifiable.

Clapway may use the personally identifiable information collected through its Web Sites or Applications primarily for such purposes as:

  * helping to establish and verify the identity of users;
  * opening, maintaining, administering and servicing users’ accounts or memberships;
  * processing, servicing or enforcing transactions and sending related communications;
  * providing services and support to users;
  * improving the Web Sites and Applications, including tailoring it to users’ preferences;
  * providing users with product or service updates, promotional notices and offers, and other information about Clapway and its affiliates;
  * responding to your questions inquiries, comments and instructions;
  * protecting our systems from fraud and unlawful access;
  * maintaining the security and integrity of its systems.



Clapway will collect only as much personal information as is needed for these specific purposes, and will not use it for other purposes without obtaining your consent. Clapway uses the anonymous browsing information collected automatically by its servers primarily to help it administer and improve its Web Sites. Clapway may also use aggregated anonymous information to provide information about its Web Sites and Applications to potential business partners and other unaffiliated entities. Again, this information is not personally identifiable.

_We, or our advertising networks may also use cookie, tag, beacon, or other similar technology to serve you relevant advertisements and alert you to our content, even on other sites and services. This technology can also be used to collect and analyze aggregated information about our users. The National Advertising Initiative has more information and an opt-out site maintained here:  [ **http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/**](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)_

If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.

  * **With your consent**

  * **In case of a sale or asset transfer**



If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of our assets, user information, including personal information collected from you through your use of our services, could be included in the transferred assets.

Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you on this site. We also do not control the privacy policies and your privacy settings on third-party sites, including social networks.
