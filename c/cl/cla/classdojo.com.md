# Privacy Policy | ClassDojo

###  Overview 

Personal information is any information you provide to us that personally identifies you, like your name or email address, or other information which could be reasonably linked to such identifying information by us. We will only collect, use, and share your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This policy applies whether you use ClassDojo through http://www.classdojo.com (the “ClassDojo Website”), our mobile applications (the “ClassDojo Apps”), or any of our other products or services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Service”). In addition, this Privacy Policy also covers ClassDojo's treatment of any personal information about our users that our partners or other services might share with us, for example responses to a teacher survey collected through WuFoo. 

This policy does not apply to websites or services or practices of companies that ClassDojo doesn’t own or control, such as third party services you might access through links or other features (e.g., social media buttons) on the Service. These other services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them before providing them with personal information. 

Whether you are new here (welcome!), or have been using ClassDojo for a long time (welcome back!), please do take the time to get to know our privacy practices. We think they’re pretty clear and friendly, but if you have any questions, we’re here to help. You can visit the [ClassDojo Privacy Center](https://web.archive.org/privacycenter) to learn more about how we protect your privacy, or send us an email at privacy@classdojo.com. By using the Service, you acknowledge that you accept and agree to this Privacy Policy. 

Additionally, in our commitment to protect the privacy of children, ClassDojo participates in the [iKeepSafe Safe Harbor program](http://ikeepsafe.org/privacy/coppa/). ClassDojo has been granted the iKeepSafe COPPA Safe Harbor seal signifying its Website and Apps have been reviewed and approved for having policies and practices surrounding the collection, use, maintenance and disclosure of personal information from children consistent with the iKeepSafe COPPA Safe Harbor program guidelines. 

ClassDojo is also a signatory to the Student Privacy Pledge, agreeing to a set of principles intended to safeguard student privacy, including responsible stewardship, protection, and transparent handling of student personal information. Read more about the Student Privacy Pledge [here](http://studentprivacypledge.org/?page_id=45). 

Basically, 

Protecting your privacy is incredibly important to us. This Privacy Policy is here to help you understand how we treat any personal information that you share with us when you use ClassDojo. This policy applies to every ClassDojo product - other companies that ClassDojo doesn’t own or control will have their own privacy policies, and you should read them, too! ClassDojo has been certified by [iKeepSafe](http://ikeepsafe.org/privacy/coppa/), an FTC-approved COPPA Safe Harbor, and has also signed the [Student Privacy Pledge](http://studentprivacypledge.org/?page_id=45).

###  What is ClassDojo? 

ClassDojo is a communication platform that helps teachers encourage students in class and engage parents. In the classroom, teachers use ClassDojo to give students encouragement (or “[feedback points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125)”) for showing critical skills or strengths - ones like persistence, critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership. They use the ClassDojo App or the ClassDojo Website - if multiple devices are used, they will all sync with each other. Beyond the classroom, teachers use ClassDojo to engage families. Teachers can instantly message parents with text-based messages, pictures, videos, and stickers, and also add posts to [Class Story](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103) and [School Story](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/209685943) \- a private feed of moments from the classroom and school that only parents, “[verified teachers](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889043),” and school leaders can see. Teachers can also let parents see how their children are doing at school by sharing their student profiles with parents to highlight the feedback points they’ve earned. 

Parents access ClassDojo using a [unique code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730289) provided by their child’s teacher, or through an email/SMS invitation directly from the teacher containing the unique code. Parents can only view their own children’s feedback points, not those of any other students. Students can also create their own account, but can only tie that account to a class after they receive a [unique code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422145) from their teacher; if they’re under 13, they’ll need to have parental consent or notice (as applicable) in order to access certain features of their account. In the student account, students can, for example, see feedback given by their teacher, upload photos and videos that only they, parents of the class, and teachers can see, as well as customize their ClassDojo avatar - a cute monster that represents the student on ClassDojo. 

When students set up a ClassDojo account, they create a unique username and password. In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we ask for their age, and if they are under 13, we also ask for a parent or guardian’s email address to request parental consent. **We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information when setting up an account.** If a student’s school or teacher elects to utilize the [Student Stories](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211828723) feature within the ClassDojo App on a device in school, the student (without needing to sign up for a ClassDojo student account) may take videos, photos and write captions (which may contain personal information) which will be collected by ClassDojo. If a student already has a student account, these photos, videos and captions may appear in their student account. If the school or teacher elects to utilize this Student Stories feature, the school will be responsible for obtaining any necessary parental consent under [COPPA](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986). Additionally, the student’s teacher needs to approve the photo or video taken by the student before it can be shared with parents or students. 

School Leaders also play a meaningful role on ClassDojo. They can share notes, photos, and videos on School Story - only parents connected to classes in the school can see these posts. School Leaders can also create classes, share classes with teachers to give feedback to students and message with parents, plus see [Highlights](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207813176-What-can-School-Leaders-see-and-do-#web) \- a high-level overview of all the feedback and engagement happening within their school. 

More information on how the Service operates is located [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/200873509) and your participation and use of the Service is governed by our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms) (“Terms”).

ClassDojo helps teachers encourage students and engage parents! Learn more [here](https://web.archive.org/learnmore).

###  How does ClassDojo protect children’s personal information? 

Protecting children’s privacy is especially important to us - we’re educators and parents ourselves, after all. This is why we’ve signed the Student Privacy Pledge and received iKeepSafe’s COPPA Safe Harbor seal, signifying that this Privacy Policy and our practices with respect to the operation of the Service have been reviewed and approved for compliance with iKeepSafe’s COPPA Safe Harbor program. COPPA protects the online privacy of children under the age of 13 (“child” or “children”); for more information about COPPA and generally protecting children’s online privacy, please visit [OnGuard Online](http://www.onguardonline.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online). 

**What information does ClassDojo collect from children, and how is it used?**  
ClassDojo collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to create accounts on our Service: we ask students to provide a unique username (we advise students not to use their real names), a password, and the [unique code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422145) they have been given by their teacher to connect with a class. Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, we also ask for the child’s age, and a parent or guardian email address from the child so we can seek verifiable parental consent or provide parental notice (as applicable). We will not use parent emails provided this way to market our Service to the parent, unless the parent has opted in to email marketing or has separately created an account on our Service. We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information when setting up an account.

**Photos and Videos**  
If a student’s school or teacher elects to utilize the Student Stories feature within the ClassDojo App on a device in school, the student (without needing to sign up for a ClassDojo student account) may take videos, photos and write captions (which may contain personal information) which will be collected by ClassDojo. If the school or teacher elects to utilize this Student Story feature, the school will be responsible for obtaining any necessary parental consent under [COPPA](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986). Additionally, the student’s teacher must approve the photos or videos taken by students before they can be shared with parents. If a student already has a student account, photos, videos and captions may appear in their student account. Additionally, students may be able to upload photos and videos directly by signing into their student account (if so, this will only be with parental consent obtained from ClassDojo). Please note, that if you as a parent provide an email to the school when the school is obtaining parental consent, we may send an email out to you asking you to verify your child’s account, but you will not receive any other emails unless you have opted in to email marketing or have separately created an account on our Service.

In addition to the information listed above, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the "Information collected automatically" section. 

We use this information to provide the Service to the child, for security and safety purposes, as required by law, or to enforce our Terms. We will not require children to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the Service. If we discover that we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, we will take appropriate steps to either delete the information, or immediately seek the parent’s consent for that collection. We do not disclose any personal information about children to third parties, except to service providers necessary to provide the Service, as required by law, or to protect the security of the Service or other users. Information collected from students (including personal information and information collected automatically) is **never** used or disclosed for third party advertising or for any first- or third-party behaviorally targeted advertising, and children’s personal information is **never** sold or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers. 

We also receive from the child’s teacher whatever name he or she has provided for the student, and the [feedback points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125) assigned by that teacher. Teachers can choose to provide full names for students (e.g., first name and last name) when setting up their class; they can also opt to only provide non-identifying information (e.g., just first name, only initials, or even just seat numbers). 

Basically, 

ClassDojo has been certified by iKeepSafe, an FTC-approved COPPA Safe Harbor, for compliance with their COPPA Safe Harbor program. We don’t ask for or require children to provide personal information beyond that which is reasonably necessary to use ClassDojo. Information collected from students is **never** used or disclosed for third party advertising or any kind of behaviorally-targeted advertising, and it is **never** sold or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers. 

* * *

###  Push Notifications 

ClassDojo may send push notifications to students - for example, letting them know when their weekly report is ready, or telling them about an achievement milestone they reached! We require children provide a parent’s email address before he or she can receive push notifications from ClassDojo. We will then provide the parent with notice and provide the parent the opportunity to prevent further notifications. The device identifier for a child’s account will only be associated with other personal information once parental consent is provided. If you are a student or a parent of a child and no longer want these communications to be sent, please either turn off the push notifications on your device, or contact us at privacy@classdojo.com. 

Basically, 

Before ever sending a push notification to a child, we will provide notice to parents, or obtain parental consent. Parents can always opt-out later as well. 

* * *

###  What Children’s Information is Visible to Others? 

No [student’s profile](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422155) is made available or visible to the public through ClassDojo. If a teacher utilizes the Student Stories feature in the ClassDojo App on a device in the classroom, other students can view pictures or videos taken by other students in this same ClassDojo App on this shared device, but students can’t view each other’s individual student profiles (which contain feedback points). Parents will be able to view their own child’s Student Story (including videos and photos taken by other students that tag their child), but only after the teacher has approved the photos or videos. Teachers may [share their classes](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202027909), including [feedback points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125), Student Stories, and Class Story, with other teachers or school leaders in their school. Please note that if the teacher chooses to display ClassDojo in their classroom, which is not a direct feature of ClassDojo (i.e., through utilizing non-ClassDojo resources, such as projecting via a smartboard or interactive whiteboard), students physically present in that classroom may see other students’ names, avatars (which can be the default avatars, or avatars modified by students) and total feedback points - this is similar to how paper-based sticker charts displayed in a classroom might work. Students’ full profiles showing each feedback point awarded are not shown in this class view, and are therefore kept private for each student, their teacher(s), and their parents. Teachers can of course choose not to display ClassDojo this way, for example by using the ClassDojo App on their mobile devices — and many do! 

Basically, 

By default, the full set of feedback posted to a student’s account is private to the student, their teacher(s) and their parents. If a teacher displays the ClassDojo website in class - which is completely optional - only a student’s total points and avatar will be displayed.Parents can view all posts shared on their child’s Student Story, as well as every post shared on Class Story. 

* * *

###  How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children’s Information? 

We only keep a child’s personal information for as long as his or her student account is [active](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165), unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms. More specifically, ClassDojo operates a 3-tier student data protection policy to protect all students’ (not just children’s) information ( **“3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy”** ): 

  1. **Minimal information:** As mentioned before, ClassDojo collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to create accounts on our Service: we ask students to provide just the unique student code given by their teacher, a username, and a password. We advise students to not use any personal information in their username. Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, we ask students for their age, and a parent or guardian’s email address if they are under 13 years of age so we can seek verifiable parental consent or provide parental notice (as applicable). Beyond this information, the ClassDojo student account does not allow students the ability to enter any additional personal information to set up an account. The Student Stories feature (which can be used without signing up for a student account) includes teacher approval of photos or videos taken by a student within the ClassDojo app used on a classroom device. If a student already has a student account, photos, videos and captions that have tagged that student may appear in their student account. In addition to the information entered by the child, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the “Information collected automatically” section.

  2. **One year deletion policy for feedback points:**  
To protect students, ClassDojo sets limits on how long students' [feedback points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125) are retained. For all students, feedback points older than 12 months are automatically deleted, unless the student or their parent chooses to retain them by creating their own associated account. For example, if a teacher sets up a class on ClassDojo on January 1, 2016, then unless students or parents create accounts, on January 1, 2017 any feedback points given in that class on or before January 1, 2016 would be deleted (and will continue to be deleted on an ongoing basis as each point reaches 12 months in age). This means feedback points cannot exist long-term without either being deleted automatically, or students or parents knowing about them and being able to access and delete them on their own (by deleting both the parent and student accounts entirely). Teachers can also delete feedback points at any time.

  3. **Deleting inactive accounts:**  
If a student’s account is [inactive](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165) for twelve months or more (meaning no teacher has given feedback to the student or messaged with the student’s parent, and neither the parent nor the student have logged into his or her account), ClassDojo will automatically delete the student account, including all personal information provided by students or collected by ClassDojo from students, as well as feedback points associated with the account that are more than 12 months old. Learn more about how we delete student accounts [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165). Please note that this does not include photos or videos or other information captured through Student Stories which are shared with all parents and are not just part of the student account. 




Basically, 

We only keep a child’s personal information for as long as the account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to enforce our policies, or to ensure the security of our community. Additionally, we protect students with our industry-leading 3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy: (1) we collect only minimal information from students (a random username, a password, and a parent’s email) to register for their student account, (2) we automatically delete their feedback points after a year - unless students or parents choose to save them for longer, and (3) we delete students’ accounts if they’re [inactive](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165) for more than twelve months. 

* * *

###  Parental Choices 

If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child who has created a ClassDojo account and you did not receive an email seeking your consent or providing notice (as per COPPA), you can email us at privacy@classdojo.com to have that child’s account deleted. 

Any parents that want copies of their children’s personal information that we may have stored can contact us either by sending an email at privacy@classdojo.com or as described in the "How Can I Contact ClassDojo With Questions" section below. At any time, parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their children, and can request that we delete the personal information we have collected from their child by contacting us as per the "How can I contact ClassDojo with questions?" section below. Please keep in mind that deleting records may require us to terminate the account in question. Also remember that before we can share the information with you, or delete it per your request, we will need to verify your identity, for example by requiring that you provide acceptable forms of personal identification. 

Basically, 

We believe parents should always be able to delete their child's account, request for us to delete their child’s personal information, or obtain a copy of their child's personal information. Just email us and we’ll be happy to help. 

* * *

###  What information does ClassDojo collect? 

We collect two types of information about you: (1) information that you voluntarily provide us by using the ClassDojo Service (described below under "Information you provide to us") and (2) information collected automatically as result of your use of the Service (described below under “Information collected automatically”). The types and amounts of information collected will vary depending on whether the user is a teacher, school leader, parent or student (e.g. we collect minimal information from students) and how they use ClassDojo (e.g. if teachers join their school, we may need to collect school address information). 

Basically, 

ClassDojo asks for some limited information directly from teachers, parents, and students (such as account information), and also collects some information automatically (such as crash reports when errors occur) in order to provide you with the best possible ClassDojo experience. 

* * *

###  Information you provide to us 

There are currently three categories of users on our Service: teachers, parents, and students. We describe the information collected from students under 13 in the section above; for other users, we collect and store the following types of information from each type of user: 

  * **Account Sign-up and Profile Information:** To create a ClassDojo account as a teacher, school leader, or parent, you may be asked to provide some basic information such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, password and a profile photo. If you create a ClassDojo account as a student, you will be asked to enter the [unique code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422145) you have been given by your teacher (students are unable to sign up for the Service without this), along with a unique username and password. Per COPPA, we may also ask for your age and, if you are under 13, a parent or guardian’s email address so we can give parents notice or seek parental consent, as appropriate. We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information to create their student accounts., Teacher and school leader profiles may be viewed by other teachers and school leaders in the same school; however, no teacher, parent or student profile is made available or visible to the general public through the functionality of our Service. 

  * **School Information and Collaboration Features:** If you are a teacher or school leader, as part of the profile information you provide, you may choose to associate your account with an existing school or may enter a new school name and possibly your school’s address if we do not have it already. If you are using the Service as a teacher or school leader, we may ask you for permission to collect and store your precise geolocation information to help us identify schools located nearby for you. By connecting you with your school, the Service may enable and provide additional collaboration features for teachers and school leaders within the same school such as adding photos, videos, and text updates on School Story for parents and other "[verified teachers](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889043)" in that school to see. Learn more about our current collaboration features and what information will be shared [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202027909). 

  * **Class Information:** As a teacher you’ll need to enter the class year (e.g., first grade) and the names of the students in your class. If a teacher opts to share the classes they set up on ClassDojo with other teachers or School Leaders in their school, such as teachers they co-teach with, then those teachers can also see that class’s information. 

  * **Inviting Others:** As a teacher or school leader, you can invite your students’ parents to join the Service, for example by providing their email address or phone number (to invite them via SMS) within ClassDojo. As a parent, school leader, or teacher you can also invite others to join the Service by utilizing your own native mobile application functionality through the ClassDojo App, for example by email, SMS, or sharing via Facebook or Twitter. We will collect and store the email and phone numbers you provide with these requests, and will also treat this as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may also ask you for access to the contacts on your mobile device to prevent you having to enter contact information for those invitations you send through our application and may store these contacts from your address book. If these individuals would like to request deletion of their information, they may contact us directly at privacy@classdojo.com. 

  * **Feedback Points:** As a teacher or school leader, you can customize a list of feedback types that you want to encourage or recognize using [feedback points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125), such as persistence, teamwork, or leadership. These feedback points cannot be viewed by the general public through our Service. A student’s feedback points can only be viewed on ClassDojo by that student, the teacher who awarded them, that student’s parents, and other teachers or school leaders the class is shared with. If the teacher chooses to display totals to the class, other students in the class may be able to see each other’s aggregated totals (but not individual feedback points). 

  * **Messaging:** As a teacher or school leader, you can privately message with individual parents that have signed up for the Service, or send broadcast messages to all parents at once, using the [ClassDojo Messaging](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730309), Class Story, and School Story features. As a teacher, school leader, or parent, your name and profile photo may be displayed to the person with whom you are messaging, and if you are a teacher or school leader, you may receive a ‘read receipt’ showing how many parents have read your message. Please be aware that by using a broadcast messaging feature such as [Class Story](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103) or [School Story](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/209685943), any messages, photos, videos or other content shared can be viewed by all parents, teachers and school leaders that are members of that class or school, respectively. In the case that a photo or video is shared in a broadcast message, Class Story, or School Story showing a student who does not want photos taken of him/her (or whose parent does not want photos taken of him/her), the student or parent can contact us at privacy@classdojo.com to remove it. We will store messages, and any content sent with the messages (e.g., photos), to provide the Service, and to help teachers and school leaders keep a log of their communications with parents. 

  * **Contact Information:** When you choose to provide us with your personal information through the Service in some other manner (e.g., when you send us an email asking a question, submit a support request, participate in a video testimonial about our Service, or choose to participate in any research efforts with ClassDojo to improve the Service). 




Our use of the information above is described below in the "How Does ClassDojo Use the Information it Collects” section. If you are using the ClassDojo App, we may ask you for certain permissions - please click [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422195) for more detail about those permissions. 

Basically, 

We ask you for different types of information based on who you are (i.e., teacher, school leader, parent, and student) and which ClassDojo features you use (e.g., sending a message between a teacher and a parent, or helping a teacher join their school). 

* * *

###  Information collected automatically 

Like most web-based services, we (or our service providers) may automatically receive and log information on our server logs from your browser or your device when you use the Service. For example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to ClassDojo (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show). If you use ClassDojo on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent Service across your different devices. If we do combine any automatically-collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy. 

The technologies and information we automatically collect include: 

  * **Cookies and other similar technologies:** We (or our service providers) may use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit our Service including, [clear GIFs (also known as “web beacons”), “tags”, “scripts”, and “cookies”](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204430505). We use both session and persistent cookies: a session cookie disappears after you close your browser; a persistent cookie remains after you close your browser (although it can be removed) and may be used by your browser to identify you on subsequent visits to the Service. We may also use, collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5). Like many services, ClassDojo uses these technologies to tailor the Service for you, and to help the Service work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences.  
Please read our [Cookie Policy](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204430505) for more details, including how to remove or modify your cookie settings. 

  * **Device information:** We collect device-specific information such as your operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers. This helps us measure how the Service is performing, improve ClassDojo for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if you’ve opted in to receive them. 

  * **Log information:** Like most online services, when you use our Service, we automatically collect and store certain information in our server logs. Examples include things like: 

    * Details of how you used our service, such as your activity on the Service, and the frequency and duration of your visits to the ClassDojo Website or ClassDojo App (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show) 

    * Telephony log information like your phone number and SMS routing information 

    * IP Address 

    * Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL 

This information helps us make decisions about what we should work on next - for example, by showing which features are most (or least!) popular. 

  * **Location information:** When you use our Service we may collect and process information about your geographic location, for example through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals. We collect both coarse (i.e., city-level) location data and precise location data. If we collect precise geolocation information (“precise” meaning sufficient to identify street name and name of city or town) from you (such as when a teacher is searching for a school), we ask for your explicit opt-in permission. We **do not** collect precise geolocation data from students. We will not store or track your device location on an on-going basis or without your permission. We do not share precise geo-location data with third parties, other than our service providers as necessary to provide the Service. If you no longer wish to allow us to track your location information, you may opt-out at any time by turning it off at the device level. 




Basically, 

We collect some information from you automatically using [cookies](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204430505) so that we know when things go wrong, or to help us understand what parts of ClassDojo need some improvement. If we need to collect street-level (“precise”) geolocation data from you as a teacher, school leader, or parent, we’ll ask for your explicit, opt-in consent. We do not collect precise geolocation data from students. 

* * *

###  How does ClassDojo use the information it collects? 

First and foremost, you should know that ClassDojo does not sell or rent any of your, or your child’s, personal information to any third party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes. Targeted advertising is not permitted on ClassDojo. We use the information we collect from you to provide you with the best ClassDojo experience. More specifically, this information is used to: 

  * Provide and improve the Service, for example by developing new products and features 

  * Respond to your requests for information or customer support 

  * Customize the Service for you, and improve your experience with it 

  * Send you information about new features and ClassDojo products we believe you may be interested in 

  * Most crucially, to protect our community by making sure the Service remains safe and secure 




We use automatically collected information (described in the "Information collected automatically" section above) to provide and support our Service, and for the additional uses described in this section of our Privacy Policy. 

Basically, 

ClassDojo doesn’t sell or rent your information to third-parties, and we don’t permit targeted advertising on ClassDojo. We only ask you to share information with us when it can help provide you with a better ClassDojo experience. 

* * *

###  Will ClassDojo share any information it collects? 

First and foremost, you should know that ClassDojo **does not sell or rent** your (or your child's) personal information to any third party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes. Targeted advertising is not permitted on ClassDojo. Furthermore, we do not share personal information with any third parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy: 

  * **Other Users You Share and Communicate with on ClassDojo:** No teacher, school leader, parent or student profiles are made available to the general public through our Service. Furthermore, students cannot share their account information (except their avatar) with anyone on ClassDojo. If you are a teacher, school leader, or a parent, you may choose to share information or content through the Service with other ClassDojo teachers, school leaders, or parents - for example, things like your account information, [feedback points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125) awarded to students you teach (if you are a teacher or school leader) or to your children (if you are a parent) or other information you share with teachers, school leaders, or parents you are messaging through [ClassDojo Messaging](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730309), Class Story, or School Story or our other collaboration features. 

Please keep in mind that information (including personal Information or children's personal information) or content that you voluntarily disclose to others - including to other ClassDojo users you interact with through the Service (such as messages you might send other users or other teachers and school leaders you collaborate with) - can be viewed, copied, stored, and used by the people you share it with. We cannot control the actions of people with whom you choose to share information. 

  * **Third-party integrations on our Service:** When, as a teacher, school leader, or parent, you use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Service, they may receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you invite others via Facebook or Twitter, these services receive the information that you share through this functionality, and information that you are sharing from ClassDojo. Information collected by these apps, websites or integrated services is subject to their own terms and policies. 

  * **Service Providers:** Targeted advertising is not permitted on ClassDojo. We do work with vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf - we can’t build everything ourselves, after all! We may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, providing customer support software, and security. Please see [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203732189) for a list of the third parties we work with to provide the Service. Generally, these service providers do not have the right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Additionally, these service providers must adhere to confidentiality and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

  * **Testimonials:** We post testimonials on our Service which may contain personal information such as the name, photo and/or a video of the individual in the testimonial. We obtain the individual’s consent in advance to ensure we have permission to post this content publicly. To request removal of your personal information from our testimonials, please contact us at privacy@classdojo.com. 

  * **Analytics Services:** We use analytics services, including mobile analytics software, to help us understand and improve how the Service is being used. These services may collect, store and use information in order to help us understand things like how often you use the Service, the events that occur within the application, usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded. A current list of analytics providers that we use is located [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203732189). 

  * **Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information:** We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly, including with users, partners or the press in order to, for example, demonstrate how ClassDojo is used, spot industry trends, or to provide marketing materials for ClassDojo. Any aggregated information shared this way will not contain any personal information. 

  * **Legal Requirements: ** We may disclose personal information if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process. We may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to to protect the rights, property, or safety of ClassDojo, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our our Terms of Service or other agreements. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection or responding to government requests. 

  * **Sharing with ClassDojo Companies:** Over time, ClassDojo may grow and reorganize. We may share your personal information with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

  * **Change of control:** In the event that all or a portion of ClassDojo or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third party, personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third party. This Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this policy (unless you give consent to a new policy). We will provide you with notice of an acquisition within thirty (30) days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, or by email to your email address that you provided to us. If you do not consent to the use of your personal information by such a successor company, you may request its deletion from the company. 

In the unlikely event that ClassDojo goes out of business, or files for bankruptcy, we will protect your personal information, and will not sell it to any third party. 

  * **With your consent:** Other than the cases above, we won’t disclose your personal information for any purpose unless you consent to it. Additionally, as discussed above, we will never sell or rent your personal information to advertisers or other third parties. 




Basically, 

ClassDojo doesn’t sell or rent your information to any [third parties](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203732189). We believe your information is yours, and you should own it - we think that’s the right way to operate. We share some information with service providers who help us provide you with the ClassDojo service - like companies that help us send emails, for example, or if we have to to comply with the law. 

And, if ClassDojo is ever acquired or goes out of business, our commitments don’t change: we still won’t sell or rent your information to anyone. Your information will continue to be protected by this policy, and any company that acquires ClassDojo will have to abide by this policy. 

* * *

###  How does ClassDojo protect and secure my information? 

Your ClassDojo account is protected by a password. You can help us protect against unauthorized access to your account by keeping your password secret at all times.   
The security of your personal information is important to us. We work hard to protect our community, and we maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure of or access to personal information. In particular: 

  * Our engineering team is dedicated to keeping your personal information secure 

  * We work with a team of security researchers to continually test ClassDojo’s security practices for vulnerabilities 

  * We periodically review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems 

  * We continually develop and implement features to keep your personal information safe - for example, when you enter any information anywhere on the Service, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL/TLS) by default 

  * We ensure passwords are stored and transferred securely using encryption and salted hashing 

  * We automatically delete [inactive student accounts](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165) after a specific period of time, as per our retention policy, described in the "How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children’s Information?" section 

  * We also operate a ‘bug bounty’ security program to encourage an active community of third party security researchers to report any security bugs to us. More information on this is available by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com 




For additional information on our security practices, please visit our [Privacy Center](https://web.archive.org/privacycenter).   
Although we make concerted good faith efforts to maintain the security of personal information, and we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our systems, no practices are 100% immune, and we can’t guarantee the security of information. Outages, attacks, human error, system failure, unauthorized use or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. If we learn of a security breach, we will attempt to notify you electronically (subject to any applicable laws) so that you can take appropriate protective steps; for example, we may post a notice on our homepage (www.classdojo.com) or elsewhere on the Service, and may send email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. 

Basically, 

The security of your information is important to us, and we take it very seriously. We’re always adding safeguards to ensure the safety and security of ClassDojo and our community of teachers, school leaders, parents, and students. You can help us out by keeping your password secret! 

* * *

###  ClassDojo’s commitments to providing Transparency and Choice 

Basically, 

At ClassDojo, we believe that more transparency is better. We try to give you control, with easy settings and options, so that you can make good choices when it comes to your information and how it is used. 

* * *

###  Can I opt-out of providing information? 

You can always decline to share personal information with us, or even block all [cookies](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204430505). However, it’s important to remember that many of ClassDojo’s features may not be accessible, or may not function properly - for example, we may not be able to remember your language preferences for you. 

Basically, 

You can always opt-out of providing us information, though we might not be able to provide you with all of ClassDojo’s features. 

* * *

###  How can I access and manage my personal information? 

ClassDojo aims to provide you with easy access to any personal information we have collected about you. If that information is incorrect, we give you easy ways to update it, or to delete it, unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business (e.g., we need at least an email address for your account) or legal purposes. 

  * **Accessing Your Information:** Upon request, ClassDojo will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information, and, if you are a user of ClassDojo, you may request access to all your personal information we have on file by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com. In some cases, we won’t be able to guarantee complete access due to legal restrictions - for example, you will not be allowed to access files that contain information about other users or information that is confidential to us. We may not be able to fulfill requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort or would be extremely impractical. 

  * **Updating Your Information:** You may update, correct, or delete some of your profile information or your preferences at any time by logging into your account on ClassDojo and accessing your account settings page. You may have to verify your identity before you can do that. You may also, at any time, update, correct, or delete certain personal information that you have provided to us by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. Please note that while your changes may be reflected promptly in active content, users that have previously accessed the content may still have access to old copies cached on their device or may have copied and stored your content. In addition, we may retain a backup copy of the prior version for a limited period of time or for legal purposes. 

  * **Accessing Your Child’s Information:** Take a look at our “Parental Choices” section to see how you can obtain copies of your child’s personal information. 




Basically, 

You can always access and manage your personal information through your ClassDojo account, or by contacting us. 

* * *

###  How can I delete my account? 

We hope you love using ClassDojo now and always. However, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account (or your child’s account, if you are his or her parent), you can do that at any time by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com. If you are a parent, teacher, or school leader using the ClassDojo Website, you may also delete your account by logging into your account and accessing your account settings page. 

When you delete your account, we delete your profile information and any other content you provide in your profile (such as your name, username, password, email address, and profile photos) and depending on the category of user you are (i.e., teacher, school leader, parent or student), [feedback points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125) and information collected through the [mobile permissions](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422195) you’ve granted. Information that you have shared with others, others have shared about you, or content other users may have copied and stored, is not part of your account and may not be deleted when you delete your account. For more details, please read “[What happens when I delete my account?](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730319)” in our FAQs. 

Basically, 

You can always delete your account by visiting your account settings, or simply by contacting us. For more details on what happens when you delete your account, click [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730319). 

* * *

###  How long does ClassDojo keep information about me? 

We store your personal information for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Services to you and others, including those described above. Personal information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted, unless we no longer need the data to provide products and services, in which case we will delete prior to you deleting your account. 

Please note that we may have to retain some information after your account is closed, to comply with legal obligations, to protect the safety and security of our community or our Service, or to prevent abuse of our Terms. You can, of course, delete your account at any time, as per the "How can I delete my account?" section. 

**3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy:** In addition to the policy above that applies to all users, we only keep a student’s personal information while the student’s account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms. More specifically, we have a 3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy to protect students’ information: we collect minimal information from students, delete feedback points automatically after 1 year if parents or students haven’t created associated accounts, and delete student accounts if they are [inactive](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165) for twelve months. Read more details about this incredibly student-friendly policy in the “How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children’s Information?” section. 

Basically, 

We keep teacher, school leader, and parent personal information until it is deleted, or until we no longer need it to provide you with the ClassDojo service. We only keep student personal information for as long as the student’s account is [active](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165), unless we are required by law to retain it, or need it to protect the safety of our users. Additionally, for students, we have our 3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy that states how we delete students’ information after some time - our business is not about creating permanent records. 

* * *

###  What communications will I receive from ClassDojo? 

If you registered on ClassDojo, provided an email or phone number to us, or otherwise opted-in to receive communications from us, we may send you messages and updates regarding your account, including privacy and security notices, updates regarding the Service, and information regarding products, features or services from ClassDojo. These communications may include, but are not limited to, social media updates, SMS/MMS messages, push notifications, email, and postal mail.

If they would prefer not to receive our communications, they may opt-out using the “STOP” instructions contained in those communications. 

We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us if your device supports it. We use this confirmation to help us understand which emails are most interesting and helpful.

* * *

###  Social Media Features/Widgets 

The Service may now or in the future include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and the Twitter Tweet button. These social media features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these social media features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing each social media feature. If you are not comfortable accessing such social media websites and using such social media features, please don’t use them!

###  How will ClassDojo notify me of changes to this policy? 

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy - you can see when the last update was by looking at the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. We won’t reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. If we make any significant changes, we’ll provide prominent notice by posting a notice on the Service and/or notifying you by email (using the email address you provided), so you can review and make sure you know about them. 

In addition, if we ever make significant changes to the types of personal information we collect from children, or how we use it, we will notify parents in order to obtain parental consent or notice for those new practices. 

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time, to stay informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information through the Service. If you don’t agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you may terminate your account (although we’ll be sad to see you go!). By continuing to use the Service after the revised Privacy Policy has become effective, you acknowledge that you accept and agree to the current version of the Privacy Policy. 

Basically, 

We will let you know by email and/or on our website when we make significant changes to our Privacy Policy. If we make significant changes to the types of personal information we collect from children, or how we use it, we will notify parents, or ask for their consent.

By using the Service, you consent to this, and to the use and storage of personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
