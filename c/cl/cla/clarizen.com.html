Clarizen has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor program, and to view the Clarizen's certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>. In so doing, Clarizen adopts the following principles from the Safe Harbor program:</p><ol><li>Clarizen may collect certain Sensitive Personal Information from and about individuals which can be identified with such specific individual, including without limitation, the contact and financial information mentioned above. You understand and agree that Clarizen may forward such information on as appropriate and permitted by law. <strong>If you provide such Sensitive Personal Information, you cannot opt out of any lawful request for said information from law enforcement agencies or prevent Communispace from providing such information as otherwise required by law. Further, i</strong>n certain rare instances, we may disclose your Sensitive Personal Information as deemed necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against those who may be causing you harm, or to Clarizen or others.</li><li>Anyone who submits Sensitive Personal Information to Clarizen may choose to not have any of their Sensitive Personal Information submitted or transferred to third parties in accordance with the terms of this Policy. If you do not wish for your Sensitive Personal Information to be disclosed, please let us know by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@clarizen.com">info@clarizen.com</a> and we will cease any distribution of your Sensitive Personal Information within a reasonable time after receiving your request.</li><li>Clarizen will only collect Sensitive Personal Information if you submit such Sensitive Personal Information. Such Sensitive Personal Information will only be used by Clarizen as appropriate. If you do not want us to collect and use Sensitive Personal Information, please do not submit such type of Sensitive Personal Information to us. &gt;</li><li>By submitting Sensitive Personal Information and checking the appropriate box consenting to the use and transfer of Sensitive Personal Information in accordance with this Policy, you authorize certain Sensitive Personal Information data transfer to others ("Transfer Recipients") for use by Transfer Recipients. Transfer Recipients may not necessarily be in the European Union, Canada or countries which have been deemed by the European Union and/or Canada to have "adequate" data protection laws, and may be in territories like the United States where an equivalent level of data protection is not granted. Clarizen will contract with Transfer Recipients to abide by privacy terms for otherwise noncompliant entities.</li><li>Clarizen has implemented security measures to ensure the privacy of your Sensitive Personal Information, and believes that such security measures provide reasonable precautions against the unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of Sensitive Personal Information Clarizen collects.</li><li>Clarizen believes that it collects only such Sensitive Personal Information which is required for Clarizen to provide services for or fulfill its contractual obligations, and therefore only collects or processes Sensitive Personal Information which is required for Clarizen to provide services for or to fulfill its contractual obligations.</li><li>Clarizen will make a good faith attempt to allow you to view your Sensitive Personal Information to the extent required by applicable regulations. Clarizen may make certain Sensitive Personal Information available on-line for inspection by the individual associated with such Sensitive Personal Information, including containing information about how to request any corrections or deletions of any erroneous Sensitive Personal Information. You can also review your Sensitive Personal Information by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@clarizen.com">info@clarizen.com</a> and we will make all corrections and/or deletions of erroneous Sensitive Personal Information brought to its attention within a reasonable time period and as required by applicable data privacy regulations.</li><li>Clarizen will regularly review its policies and practices to determine its continued compliance with the requirements of the Safe Harbor program, PIPEDA and the terms of this privacy policy. Clarizen designates the European Data Protection Authorities and JAMS to refer unresolved Safe Harbor-related privacy complaints.</li></ol><h3>Linked Sites</h3><p>Links on this Site to websites are provided as a convenience to you.
