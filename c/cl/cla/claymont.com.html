<p><b><u>Summary<o:p></o:p></u></b></p>
<p>Claymont respects and protects the privacy 
            of those that use Claymont's search engine services ("Claymont 
            Search Services"). Claymont will not sell your email address to 
            anyone without your express permission and we control all e-mail 
            delivery to assure your privacy. Claymont gathers certain types of 
            information about individuals that use the Claymont Search Services 
            (“Users”). This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") applies only to 
            online transactions, activity and email communications. This Privacy 
            Policy outlines the types of information we gather and how we use 
            it. Please be aware that we will 
release specific personal information about you if required to do so by law in 
order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, 
statute, or court order.</p>
            <p>Individually identifiable information about you is not willfully 
            disclosed to any third party without first receiving your 
            permission, as explained in this Privacy Policy. When we do share 
            information with our partners and advertisers, it is in aggregate 
            form, and does not identify you personally. Claymont does not 
            collect or use any information about you except for the information 
            that you provide or is publicly available, and this information is 
            used solely to make the services provided more relevant to your 
            interests. By becoming a Claymont User, you agree to the Claymont 
            Terms and Conditions. This includes your agreement to receive email 
            announcements, updates and other carefully screened special offers 
            and promotions. If you do not wish to receive such communications, 
            you may remove your email from the Claymont database by sending a 
            request to support@claymont.com and your web site will no longer be 
            listed in the Claymont Search Engine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Claymont and Cookies</u></b> </p>
<p>Upon your first visit to Claymont, Claymont 
            sends a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a piece of data that 
            identifies you as a unique user. Claymont uses cookies to improve 
            the quality of our service and to understand our user base more. 
            Claymont does this by storing user preferences in cookies and by 
            tracking user trends and patterns of how people search. Claymont 
            will not disclose its cookies to third parties except as required by 
            a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, 
            or court order. Most browsers are initially set up to accept 
            cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to 
            indicate when a cookie is being sent. Be aware, however, that some 
            parts of the Claymont Search Service may not function properly if 
            you refuse cookies. </p>
            <p><b><u>What Information Do We Collect?</u></b> </p>
            <p>Claymont does not collect any unique information about you (such 
            as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and 
            knowingly provide such information. Claymont notes and saves 
            information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, and 
            IP address with each query. That information is used to verify our 
            records and to provide more relevant services to users. For example, 
            Claymont may use your IP address or browser language to determine 
            which language to use when showing search results or 
            advertisements.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Third-Party Advertisement Servers</u></strong> </p>
            <p>Some of our advertisers use third-party companies to serve their 
            advertisements on our site. Often, these third-party advertising 
            companies employ cookie and visitor activity technologies to measure 
            advertisement effectiveness. We do not give any personally 
            identifiable information to them as part of this relationship. Use 
            of their tracking technology is subject to their own privacy 
            policies. If you would like more information about the privacy 
            policies of the third-party advertising providers including 
            information on how to opt out of their tracking methods, check their 
            respective sites or send request to <a href="mailto:support@Claymont.com">support@Claymont.com</a>. </p>
            <p><u><strong>Business Transfers</strong></u></p>
            <p>Claymont is always seeking to improve our website and Internet 
            Business Services. In accomplishing these objectives, we may buy or 
            sell a company, or one or more of the companies in our corporate 
            family may merge with or be acquired by another company. In the 
            event of a merger, consolidation, or sale or transfer of all or 
            substantially all of the assets or business of the company by, with, 
            or into another company (a "Successor"), one of the assets which 
            would generally be transferred is the information we collect from 
            our members, customers, registrants, and users. However, the use of 
            this information by any Successor would still be governed by the 
            terms of this Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time, 
            including any amendment after such transaction, and you will 
            continue to have the right to opt-out of sharing your information 
            with third parties. A Successor to our business is not considered to 
            be a third party for these purposes. </p>
            <p><b><u>Links to Other Sites <o:p></o:p></u></b></p>
<p>The sites displayed as search results or linked to by Claymont Search 
Services are developed by people over whom Claymont exercises no control. These 
other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit 
personal information. Claymont may choose to exhibit its search results in the 
form of a "URL redirector." When Claymont uses a URL redirector, if you click on 
a URL from a search result, information about the click is sent to Claymont, and 
Claymont in turn sends you to the site you clicked on. Claymont uses this URL 
information to understand and improve the quality of Claymont's search 
technology. For instance, Claymont uses this information to determine how often 
users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed 
to later results.</p>
            <p><b><u>With Whom Does Claymont Share Information?</u></b> </p>
<p>Claymont may share aggregate information 
            with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third 
            parties. However, we only divulge aggregate information about our 
            Users and will not share personally identifiable information with 
            any third party without your express consent. For example, we may 
            disclose how frequently the average Claymont user visits Claymont, 
            or which other query words are most often used with a certain query 
            word. Please be aware, 
however, that we will release specific personal information about you if 
required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a 
search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.</p>
<p><b><u>Your consent and changes to the Privacy Policy</u></b></p>
<p>By using the Claymont Search Services and our web site, you consent to the 
collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this policy and to 
our Terms and Conditions. Claymont may decide to change this Privacy Policy from 
time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page so that you 
are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
circumstances we disclose it. </p>
<p><b><u>Who can I ask if I have additional questions?</u></b></p>
            <p>Feel free to contact us any time and we'll answer any additional 
            questions you may have. You may notify us by either:</p>
