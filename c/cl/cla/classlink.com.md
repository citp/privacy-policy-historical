_updated June 5, 2018_

ClassLink is committed to ensuring that your information is secure and your privacy is protected. The information below outlines our privacy and security policies. Additional information is contained in our software license and service level agreements. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we store. Learn more about our [security protocols](https://www.classlink.com/security/).

### Our guiding principles on personal data

  * Data Ownership: ClassLink acknowledges that all personally identifiable information about students, teachers, administrators, and parents is the property of the educational agencies ClassLink serves.


  * Purpose: ClassLink is a trusted steward of personal data. Data received from educational agencies is to be used solely for purposes of providing educational services. Such data will not be sold or used for marketing purposes.


  * Type of Data Maintained in ClassLink: ClassLink maintains personal data needed for the satisfactory operation of the ClassLink system. This data includes what is generally regarded as [Directory Information](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/mndirectoryinfo.html) such as name, school building affiliation, grade level, and email address. ClassLink may also maintain profile pictures, cell phone numbers for students age 13+ (to send password reset verification codes), student ID numbers, login credentials for various online resources, and personal computer files (temporarily cached for file transfers between cloud drives and stored until deleted by user for the ClassLink cloud drive). ClassLink does not generally maintain information such as mailing address, gender, date of birth, and other personal demographic data.


  * Protection: ClassLink keeps all personal data confidential and secure. ClassLink team members are bound by contractual non-disclosure agreements. ClassLink’s data security protections include: internal data management policies and procedures, limitations on access to personal data, data encryption (for both data in transit and at rest), data systems monitoring, incident response plans, and safeguards to ensure personal data is not accessed by unauthorized persons when transmitted over communication networks.


  * Disposal of Data: ClassLink permanently deletes personal data after the termination of a contract, when no longer needed, or when advised to do so by the  educational agency.


  * Correction: ClassLink enables users, or their authorized parents, to review personal information maintained in ClassLink and correct erroneous information.


  * Discovery of a security breach that results in unauthorized release of personal data: ClassLink shall promptly notify affected educational agencies of such breach, shall conduct an investigation, and shall restore the integrity of its data systems as soon as possible. ClassLink will fully cooperate and assist with required notices to those individuals affected by such breach.


  * Financial Protection: ClassLink shall maintain business insurance policies to protect the educational agencies it serves.



### International – [Student Privacy Pledge](https://studentprivacypledge.org/), introduced by Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) and The Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA)

ClassLink is a signatory to the Student Privacy Pledge and abides by the commitments therein as follows:

  1. Not collect, maintain, use or share student personal information beyond that needed for authorized educational/school purposes, or as authorized by the parent/student.

  4. Not build a personal profile of a student other than for supporting authorized educational/school purposes or as authorized by the parent/student.
  5. Not make material changes to school service provider consumer privacy policies without first providing prominent notice to the account holder(s) (i.e., the educational institution/agency, or the parent/student when the information is collected directly from the student with student/parent consent) and allowing them choices before data is used in any manner inconsistent with terms they were initially provided; and not make material changes to other policies or practices governing the use of student personal information that are inconsistent with contractual requirements.
  6. Not knowingly retain student personal information beyond the time period required to support the authorized educational/school purposes, or as authorized by the parent/student.

  9. Support access to and correction of student personally identifiable information by the student or their authorized parent, either by assisting the educational institution in meeting its requirements or directly when the information is collected directly from the student with student/parent consent.
  10. Maintain a comprehensive security program that is reasonably designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of student personal information against risks – such as unauthorized access or use, or unintended or inappropriate disclosure – through the use of administrative, technological, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.
  11. Require that our vendors with whom student personal information is shared in order to deliver the educational service, if any, are obligated to implement these same commitments for the given student personal information.
  12. Allow a successor entity to maintain the student personal information, in the case of our merger or acquisition by another entity, provided the successor entity is subject to these same commitments for the previously collected student personal information.



### United States – Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ([FERPA](https://ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html))

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA sets forth protocols for ensuring privacy and security of personally identifiable information of students. ClassLink adheres to the data protection protocols set forth in FERPA.

ClassLink is [iKeepSafe Certified](https://ikeepsafe.org/certification/ferpa/):  _The iKeepSafe FERPA Certification demonstrates compliance with the federal mandates as well as iKeepSafe’s rigorous guidelines through the published Product Profile._

### United States – Children’s Internet Protection Act ([CIPA](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act))

The Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) requires schools and libraries receiving certain e-Rate benefits from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to adhere to policies that provide safe internet experiences for minors. These include policies related to:

  * Preventing access by minors to inappropriate matter on the Internet;
  * The safety and security of minors when using electronic mail, chat rooms and other forms of direct electronic communications;
  * Unauthorized access, including so-called “hacking,” and other unlawful activities by minors online;
  * Unauthorized disclosure, use, and dissemination of personal information regarding minors; and
  * Measures restricting minors’ access to materials harmful to them.



Although ClassLink does not itself prevent access to inappropriate websites, that burden belongs to the school or library, ClassLink can help create an intentional internet experience for young students by enabling instant access to positive online resources from any device.

### European Union – General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/index.htm))

GDPR is the newest body of regulation regarding the handling of personal data for citizens of the European Union (EU). The primary objective of the GDPR is to give citizens back control of their personal data. Effective May 25, 2018, GDPR replaces previous and other data protection regulations throughout the EU. ClassLink is currently compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation.

GDPR includes 11 chapters and nearly 100 articles. Below are some of the most relevant articles.

  * Article 5 “Principles relating to processing of personal data”: ClassLink is a trusted steward of personal data. Data received from educational agencies is to be used solely for purposes of providing educational services. Such data will not be sold or used for marketing purposes.
  * Article 17 “Right to be forgotten”:  Schools can choose to delete users from ClassLink at any time. Individual users can choose to delete any data they’ve added to ClassLink at any time. ClassLink promptly deletes data associated with schools no longer working with ClassLink.
  * Article 32 “Security of processing”: ClassLink keeps all personal data confidential and secure. ClassLink team members are bound by contractual non-disclosure agreements. ClassLink’s data security protections include: internal data management policies and procedures, limitations on access to personal data, data encryption (for both data in transit and at rest), data systems monitoring, incident response plans, and safeguards to ensure personal data is not accessed by unauthorized persons when transmitted over communication networks.
  * Article 33 “Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority”: GDPR requires notice to the supervisory authority within 72 hours of awareness of a personal data breach. Discovery of a security breach that results in an unauthorized release of personal data: ClassLink shall promptly notify affected educational agencies of such breach, shall conduct an investigation, and shall restore the integrity of its data systems as soon as possible. ClassLink will fully cooperate and assist with required notices to those individuals affected by such breach.
  * Article 35: “Data protection impact assessment”: ClassLink conducts various security assessments of our systems. Certain security tests are conducted annually, others more frequently and some other tests are running constantly.
  * Article 37: “Designation of a data protection officer”: ClassLink maintains a designated data protection officer who is authorized to engage security reviews and impact product development.
  * Article 44: “General principle for transfers”: To promote data sovereignty/data residency in GDPR, the regulation authorizes the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en) to decide if a third country or territory, where data may be transferred, meets adequate levels of protection. As GDPR is new, no third country or territory has yet been approved by the Commission. ClassLink customers located in the EU or UK are assigned to a data center based in the EU (Frankfurt, Germany). This EU data center maintains all needed ClassLink application and data servers and no server outside of that datacenter is used to store data or deliver services to EU or UK based customers.
