A cookie is a small piece of information that many Web sites use to help make shopping online easier. The information is stored on your computer's hard drive and provides a number of conveniences for you. We may set and access cookies on your computer to provide you with customized content and to assist in providing the services that you have requested. Most cookies are "session cookies," which automatically delete themselves from your hard drive after each session. Like many Web sites, We may automatically track information based upon your behavior on Our Web sites. We may combine information that We obtain through the use of cookies with Personal Information, other aggregate or anonymous data, including a unique ID We may assign you.

**HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?**   
We maintain electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect your Information. We protect Information about you over the Internet by using a secure web server, which allows web browser programs (such as Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer) to interact with Our web server via an encrypted session. We employ a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection that provides an encrypted connection between your computer and Us. The 128 bit encrypted connection scrambles ordinary text or data into cyphertext to safeguard sensitive information during its journey across the Internet. The information is decrypted, or put back into a readable format, when it reaches its intended destination. Depending on which browser you use, you will know you are in secured area by "https" or a lock appearing in the lower right hand corner of your browser window. When you visit Our Web site, you may move in and out of secured areas.

We may also store, process and/or transfer personal data to the United States of America and, by using Our products and services, you consent to such transfer. For example, if you elect to submit your Personal Information to the site, We will transfer and process your Personal Information across borders, specifically, the United States of America, and this information may be accessed by the courts, law enforcement and national security authorities of that jurisdiction. 

Canadian Consumers: We will comply with existing local, provincial and federal Canadian law, including but not limited to the Personal Protection and Electronic Documents Act ("PIPEDA"), and We will adhere to the Fair Information Principles, reflected within PIPEDA and provincial regulations.
