**Information Collected and How it is Used**

**Information collected if you only browse this site.**  
If you do nothing during your visit to our Web site but browse, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:

| 1. | The Internet Protocol address and domain name used. The Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or directly to your computer. We use the Internet Protocol address to direct Internet traffic to you. This address can be translated to determine the domain name of your service provider (e.g. xcompany.com or yourschool.edu);   
---|---  
2. |  The type of browser and operating system you used;   
3. | The date and time you visited this site;   
4. | The web pages or services you accessed at this site.   
  
The information we automatically collect or store is logged and used by Clark College only to improve the content of our web services and to help us understand how people are using our services. Clark College analyzes this information (the Web site logs) to determine how our Web site is being used, so that we may continually improve the site's usefulness to the public.

**What we collect if you volunteer information.**  
If, during your visit to our Web site, you participate in a survey, send an e-mail, or perform some other transaction on-line, the following additional information will be collected:

1. |  The e-mail address, and contents of e-mail, for those who communicate with us via e-mail.  
---|---  
2. | Information volunteered in response to a survey.   
3. |  Information volunteered through an on-line form for any other purpose.  
  
The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us.

We use your e-mail to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you, to address issues you may identify, to further improve our Web site, or to forward the e-mail to another agency for appropriate action. Survey information is used for research and enhancement purposes. Information from other on-line forms is used to fulfill student requests for information and/or services.

**Personal Information and Choice**

******You may choose whether to provide personal information on-line.**

"Personal information" is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information.

We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us by sending us e-mail, participating in a survey, or completing an on-line form. You may choose not to contact us by e-mail, participate in a survey or to provide any personal information using an on-line form. Your choice to not participate in these activities will not impair your ability to browse _www.clark.edu_ and read or download any information provided on the site.

If you choose not to use e-mail, participate in a survey or use an on-line form, you will be provided with alternative contact methods.

If personal information is requested on the Web site or volunteered by the user, state law and the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law.

If you believe that your personal information is being used for a purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact the Registrar as shown in the **Agency Contact Information section** of this statement.

The Clark College Web site is a general audience site and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children on-line or by e-mail will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public access.

**Public Access to Information**

****In the State of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws.

All of the information collected at this site becomes public record that may be subject to inspection and copying by members of the public, unless an exemption in law exists.
