We will hold on to your information for as long as you have your account, or as long as is needed to be able to provide the services to you, or (in the case of any contact you may have with our Customer Care team) for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only.

#### Transfer of your personal data out of the EEA

In order to process your personal data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, we may transfer your personal data to third parties and other companies in our group that are based outside of the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we attach a similar degree of protection to it (as it would receive in the EEA) by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * We will only transfer your personal data to countries, territories or sectors within a country that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
  * The transfer is subject to a legally binding and enforceable commitment on the recipient to protection the personal data (e.g. through the use of European Commission approved standard contractual clauses).
  * Where we use service providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.
  * The transfer is made subject to binding corporate rules.
  * The transfer is based on a derogation from restrictions on transferring personal data outside of the EEA (such as where you give your consent, the transfer is necessary for the performance of contract with you, or the transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims).



#### Control over your information

  * Be informed about how your personal information is being used (hopefully this privacy notice explains it all)

  * Right to withdraw your consent, where processing of your personal data is based on consent, you can remove it at any time

#### Keeping your personal information secure
