# Clarks Online - Clarks Privacy Policy - How We Use Your Data-Clarks

  


## How we use your information

Clarks never make your personal details available to any other company for marketing purposes. Clarks (and our representatives) may hold your personal details in order to process your order and maintain your account for research purposes.

  


## Use and storage of data

If you have registered with us, or ordered items from us, we will have your email address, telephone number, postal address and the method you chose to make your purchase with. If you chose to have a delivery made to a third party address, then that will also be held on our records.

We maintain an order history of your purchase(s), which allows you and us to track your deliveries and review past purchases. We may offer you a promotion or reward we think you might like based on your order history. 

We currently plan on keeping all consumer data until we have completed a review and developed plans for its archiving, deletion or depersonalisation. This review will be complete within 12-18 months.

The data that we collect from you may be transferred, processed and stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). By submitting your personal details, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.

We do not store any payment details. Once you have entered your payment details into the site we will use them for the transaction they have been entered for and that transaction only. 

  


## HR privacy

Information about you will be used for the purpose of determining your suitability for employment with Clarks. It may also be used for statistical analysis, for example to assess the success of advertising campaigns and different advertising media.

We may record information and opinions relating to you from third parties in the course of the recruitment process. You should note that your application may be subject to verification, for example your references may be taken up and any qualification which is indicated on your application may be verified by us contacting the appropriate body. This would not be done without your permission. We will not contact your current employer without your permission.

Your details will be accessible only by our authorised personnel and will not be disclosed to any third party except as required by law.

We comply with stringent safeguards to protect your personal data. If you would like any further information about your rights, which include rights of access to data, then please email us at recruitment@clarks.com.

  


## Email communications

If you have registered to receive emails from Clarks, you can remove your email address from the list at any time by using the links in the emails that are sent to you. We will never make your personal details available to other companies for marketing purposes.

We will endeavour to make all our communications clear in their intent. We will endeavour not to overuse your personal data and will not mail you more than four times a month.

**Clarks recommend a friend campaign**  
Individuals supplying Clarks with the email address of their friend via our recommend a friend campaign should first confirm that the friend consents to their email address being supplied.  
All email addresses supplied to us via the recommend a friend email campaign will be sent one email advising of the recommendation and will be given the option to supply further details and opt in to the Clarks emails.

  


## Cookies

Cookies are used to keep you logged in to the site, or keep items in your basket if you navigate away from the site and then return.

You can disable cookies in Internet Explorer by selecting ‘Page’ then ‘Web page privacy policy’ then ‘Privacy’ and changing your privacy setting using the sliding bar.

## Security

To prevent any unauthorised persons accessing your data, it is protected throughout the payment process. 

Your personal and payment details are captured online using industry-standard technology, which encrypts all information to make it secure. When you visit any of the secure areas of our site you'll notice that the web address begins 'https' and a padlock icon appears in the address bar. We also use the 'Extended Validation' certificate, so if you are using Internet Explorer 7 you will see confirmation that our identity has been verified.

  


## Access to your data

You have a right to access the personal data that we hold on you under the Data Protection Act 1998. You must make your request in writing, enclosing a fee of £10, explaining clearly the information that you wish to be supplied.
