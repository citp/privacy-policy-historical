                <p><b>What information does Clearwater collect about me and why?</b></p>

                <p>Information about your computer or device, including domain type, browser version, IP address, and 
                geo-location data may also be collected by us or by one of our service providers to learn about your

                Sites to see which areas are of most interest and to tailor our communications to your respective 
                interests. This helps us improve our Sites for all visitors and customers, and your browsing

                <p><b>How does Clearwater use my information?</b></p>
                                                                                                                                
                <p>We use the information we collect from you for the following purposes:</p>
                
                <ul>
                	<li>To set up an account, a credit card account, or a credit line account for you, so that you can 
                    make purchases, to process your orders, and to respond to any questions about your orders;</li>
                    <li>To communicate with you via email, mail, and by other methods of communications about 
                    Clearwater's services, products, and other Clearwater business matters;</li>
                    <li>To improve our services to you and improve the quality of your experience with our Sites;</li>
                    <li>To provide advertisements to you on our Sites and other websites about Clearwater products and

               <p>The businesses of Clearwater and its Sites are not designed for children.  Clearwater does not 
               knowingly collect any personal information from or about a child under the age of 13 years.</p>
               
               <p>Clearwater uses cookies to help improve our Sites and visitor and customer experience. A cookie is a 
               piece of data that a website sends to a visitor's computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. A 
               cookie assigns a unique identification to your computer or mobile device, and is then used by a website 
               to recognize your browser as a previous visitor so that your browsing experience can be personalized. 
               Such a website saves and remembers any preferences or other actions you took while visiting the 
               website. We may also use cookies to recognize you when you return to our Sites to understand your use 
               of our Sites so we can improve the features of our Sites and tailor communications relevant to you.</p>
               
               <p>We may also use our own cookies to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored 
               to your interests. Our cookies do not contain your name, address, or any financial information. You can 
               refuse cookies by turning them off in your Internet or mobile browser. In order to disable cookies, 
               please consult your browser's help section for instructions. If you turn off cookies, however, you may 
               not be able to use some or any of the features of our Sites.</p>
                               
                <p><i>Google Analytics.</i> Clearwater uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by 
                Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer 
                to help analyze how users use the Sites. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the 
                Sites, including your IP address, will be transmitted to and stored by Google on its servers. Google 
                will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Sites, compiling reports on 
                activity for operators of the Sites, and providing other services relating to activity on the Sites 
                and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so 
                by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. To read Google 
                Analytics security and privacy principles, please

                <p><i>Tawk.to.</i> Clearwater uses Tawk.to, an online messaging service that allows us to communicate 
                with you through the Sites in real time. Tawk.to uses cookies to identify and track visitors, their 
                usage of tawk.to website, and their website access preferences. Tawk.to may also transfer this 
                information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the 
                information on Tawk.to's behalf. To read Tawk.to's security and privacy principles, please

                <p><i>Flash Cookies.</i> We may also use Local Shared Objects (sometimes called "flash cookies"), 
                browser web storage (including HTML5) and application data caches. These are used to enhance your user 
                experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings. These mechanisms operate 
                similarly to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text. To find out more about

                <p><b>How does Clearwater Respond to "Do Not Track" Signals?</b></p>
                
                <p>Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services 
                with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what websites can or should do 
                when they receive these signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. By 
                visiting our Sites, you consent to our placement of cookies, Local Shared Objects, and other similar 
                technologies on your computer and/or mobile device.</p>
                
                <p><b>Will my information be shared?</b></p>
                
                <p>We do not disclose personally identifiable information about you to third parties for their 
                independent use unless: (1) you request or authorize us to do so; (2) we are required to do so in order 
                to comply with the law (for example, to comply with a search warrant, subpoena, or court order); (3) we 
                are required to do so to enforce an agreement we have with you; (4) we are required to do so in order 
                to protect our rights, property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of our employees or others; 
                (5) we are required to in order to address emergencies or acts of God; or (6) as necessary to address 
                disputes or claims, including to persons holding a legal or beneficial interest in, for example, a 
                Clearwater account.</p>

                <p>To help protect the privacy of data and personally identifiable information you provide to us through
