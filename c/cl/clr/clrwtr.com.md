The businesses of Clearwater and its Sites are not designed for children. Clearwater does not knowingly collect any personal information from or about any child under the age of 13 years.

Clearwater uses cookies to help improve our Sites and visitor and customer experience. A cookie is a piece of data that a website sends to a visitor's computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. A cookie assigns a unique identification to your computer or mobile device, and is then used by a website to recognize your browser as a previous visitor so that your browsing experience can be personalized. Such a website saves and remembers any preferences or other actions you took while visiting the website. We may also use cookies to recognize you when you return to our Sites to understand your use of our Sites so we can improve the features of our Sites and tailor communications relevant to you.

We may also use our own cookies to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests. Our cookies do not contain your name, address, or any financial information. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your Internet or mobile browser. In order to disable cookies, please consult your browser's help section for instructions. If you turn off cookies, however, you may not be able to use some or any of the features of our Sites.

_Google Analytics._  Clearwater uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer to help analyze how users use the Sites. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Sites, including your IP address, will be transmitted to and stored by Google on its servers. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Sites, compiling reports on activity for operators of the Sites, and providing other services relating to activity on the Sites and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. To read Google Analytics security and privacy principles, please [click here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en).

_Flash Cookies._  We may also use Local Shared Objects (sometimes called "flash cookies"), browser web storage (including HTML5) and application data caches. These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings. These mechanisms operate similarly to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text.

**How does Clearwater Respond to "Do Not Track" Signals?**

Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what websites can or should do when they receive these signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. By visiting our Sites, you consent to our placement of cookies, Local Shared Objects, and other similar technologies on your computer and/or mobile device.

**Will my information be shared?**
