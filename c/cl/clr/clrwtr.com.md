Valin uses cookies to help improve our Sites and visitor and customer experience.  A cookie is a piece of data that a website sends to a visitor’s computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes.  A cookie assigns a unique identification to your computer or mobile device, and is then used by a website to recognize your browser as a previous visitor so that your browsing experience can be personalized.  Such a website saves and remembers any preferences or other actions you took while visiting the website. For example, if you place items in your shopping cart at [www.valinonline.com](https://www.valinonline.com/), we may use cookies to keep those items in your cart for your future access. We may also use cookies to recognize you when you return to our Sites to understand your use of our Sites so we can improve the features of our Sites and tailor communications relevant to you.

We may also use our own cookies to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests.  Our cookies do not contain your name, address or any financial information.  Nonetheless, to opt out of Valin cookies used for this online advertising, [click here](mailto:marketing@valin.com?subject=Please%20remove%20me%20from%20your%20distribution%20list).

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your Internet or mobile browser. In order to disable cookies, please consult your browser's help section for instructions. If you turn off cookies, however, you may not be able to use some or any of the features of our Sites.

We may use "pixel tags" (sometimes called web beacons, web bugs or clear gifs), which are transparent tiny graphic images that are placed in the code on our Sites and possibly in our emails and collect information about website usage, email response and tracking. Pixel tags help us analyze our customers' online behavior and measure the effectiveness of our Sites and advertising.

Google Analytics.  Valin uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer to help analyze how users use the Sites. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Sites, including your IP address, will be transmitted to and stored by Google on its servers. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Sites, compiling reports on activity for operators of the Sites and providing other services relating to activity on the Sites and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.

Advertising.  We work with service providers such as AdRoll that help us track, collect and analyze this information. AdRoll uses algorithms to select which websites to serve our advertisements to you based on where you would prefer to see our ads on the web. We ask AdRoll to deliver only those ads that are relevant to you based on where you browse online.  You can read AdRoll’s privacy policy [here](https://www.adroll.com/about/privacy). You can opt-out of receiving targeted ads served by us or other advertising companies: AdRoll is also a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct. You may use the NAI opt out tool [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/), which will allow you to opt out of seeing targeted ads from us and from other NAI approved member companies.

We use pixel tags, either alone or in conjunction with cookies, to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Sites. This information may include your mobile device or computer's IP address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer or mobile device. We may also track certain information about the identity of the website you visited immediately before coming to our Sites as well as the identity of the websites you visit after you leave our Sites.

We may also use Local Shared Objects (sometimes called "flash cookies"), browser web storage (including HTML5) and application data caches. These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings. These mechanisms operate similarly to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text.

There is no standard that governs what websites can or should do when they receive these signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals.
