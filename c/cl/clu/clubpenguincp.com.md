# Privacy Policy | ClubPenguinCP

Club Penguin CP operates  [http://clubpenguincp.com](http://clubpenguincp.com/). It is my policy to respect your privacy regarding any information I may collect while operating my websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Chrisdog93 collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Chrisdog93’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use our website. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

We also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Chrisdog93 does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to my websites choose to interact with us in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Automattic gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Chrisdog93 does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Chrisdog93 uses cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage of my website, and their website access preferences. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using our websites, with the drawback that certain features may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Advertising

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

### Google Advertisements

Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.  Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to you based on your visit to my sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change our Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Chrisdog93’s sole discretion. Chrisdog93 encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
