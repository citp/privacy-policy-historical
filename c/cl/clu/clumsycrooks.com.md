Actress Tracey Gold, best known as Carol Seaver on TV's Growing Pains and whose battle with anorexia was highly publicized, was arrested in September 2004 for drunk driving. The California Highway Patrol busted thirty-five-year-old Gold and charged her with three felony counts: driving under the influence of alcohol causing bodily injury, driving with a blood alcohol level greater than 0.08 causing injury, and felony child endangerment. A CHP spokesman said that Gold was driving on Route 118 at about 11:51 PM when she lost control of the vehicle, rolling her Yukon down an embankment on a California highway. Luckily, Gold, her husband, and her two youngest sons (ages five and four months) were not seriously injured. However, her oldest child, 7-year-old Sage, suffered a broken clavicle and a head laceration. After CHP officers administered sobriety tests, Gold was arrested on the DUI charge. The actress first pleaded not guilty to the charges, but later changed her plea to guilty. She was sentenced to one month in a work release program, 240 hours of community service, and three years' probation, which will end in 2007. The mug shot below was taken by the Ventura County Sheriff's Office after her arrest.
