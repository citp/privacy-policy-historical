We may also use this data to conduct statistical analyses on visitors’ usage patterns and other aggregated data.</p>

			<h2>Information Collected Using Pixel Tags or Clear GIFs</h2>
			
			<p>Pixel Tags or Clear GIFs, also known as Web Beacons or Web Bugs, are transparent graphical images placed on a website. We use these items on its Website for reasons similar to those described above in the Cookies section.</p>

				The Website is targeted entirely for use by adults. We do not market to or create special areas for use by children. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect age identifying information, nor do we knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 years. In the event that we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us, in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (please see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy for more information about this Act), we will delete the child’s personally identifiable information from our files to the extent technologically possible.</p>

				<h1>What You Need to Do to Protect Your Personally Identifiable Information</h1>

				You have several options when deciding how you can best protect your User Information. One option is simply not to volunteer it. As stated above, this approach would allow you to still visit our website – although it will prevent you, for example, from ordering merchandise on-line or providing us with your comments or questions. The Federal Trade Commission’s website, www.ftc.gov, also offers useful information about how to protect personally identifiable information provided to a website.</p>
