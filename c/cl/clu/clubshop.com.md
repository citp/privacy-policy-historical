### Privacy Policy

We understand that when you are doing business online you need to trust the people with whom you are doing business.

Therefore, as a visitor to The DHS Club's web sites clubshop.com, dhs-club.com, you have the right to understand our information privacy policies before providing the DHS Club with any of your PI.

 **What information we collect**

 **Who we share your information with**  
The DHS Club will only share your contact information with your VIP Membership Coordinators and Team Coaches and with our authorized product and service providers as necessary, in order to complete a transaction that you specifically request. We do not share or sell any of your PI with anyone else - your privacy is completed protected. 

**Other Web sites**  
There are places throughout The DHS Club websites that may link you to other web sites that do not operate under The DHS Club's information privacy practices.

 **How you can control your information**  
The DHS Club provides you with the means of updating or correcting any PI stored in your "My Account" webpage. 

**How we protect your information**  
To ensure the confidentiality of your PI, The DHS Club uses leading security technology and procedures. When you submit personal information on clubshop.com, your data is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology certified by a digital certificate from Thawte Server CA. To view this site certificate on each secured page (a page which begins with "https"), click on the image of the closed lock or the solid key on the bottom bar of your browser window. A small frame displaying site security information will pop up.

By providing you with this Privacy Statement, The DHS Club is pledging our continued commitment to protecting the information you provide us. Your privacy is important to us.
