(PI includes information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address.) Therefore, as a visitor to ClubShop you have the right to understand our information privacy policies before providing the ClubShop with any of your PI. The following information explains the type of information gathered on our sites and how that information is used.

ClubShop may share your contact information with your originating sponsor or a sponsor assigned to you (name, ID number, email address, mailing address, and phone number) and your upline and/or downline Team for communications (name, ID number and e-mail address) and our authorized product and service providers as necessary in order to complete a transaction that you specifically request.

There are places throughout ClubShop.com websites that may link you to other web sites that do not operate under ClubShop information privacy practices. When you click through to these web sites, ClubShop's information privacy practices no longer apply. We recommend that you examine the privacy statements for all third party Web sites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information. These third party websites include, but are not limited to ClubShop.com Mall Stores, Service Providers, Vendors, and RSS feed sites we may have on our site for your convenience.

  
As a Clubshop Member or Partner, you may add your phone numbers, for us to contact you and for YOU to be accessible to your coaches and team members.

  
On your [Member Account](https://www.clubshop.com/cgi/appx.cgi/update) you may also provide OPTIONAL information, such as gender, birthdate, current occupation, etc. You may also decide to complete your [Personal Profile](http://www.clubshop.com/mall/other/questionnaire.php) so that we are able to let you know about any special offers that will help you to save money, while earning ClubCash on your purchase.

 **We will never share information you submit with outside third parties.**

  
ClubShop may be required by law to disclose information you have provided us. ClubShop may also disclose information against someone who poses a threat to ClubShop's interests (such as customer fraud) or whose activities could bring harm to others.
