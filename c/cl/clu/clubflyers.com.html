You will have the opportunity at that time to opt out of any new use of your information.<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT WE COLLECT</b><br>
We collect information (such as your name, email address, mailing address, and phone and credit card numbers) that you provide when you place an order, save your information with us or participate in a contest, promotion or survey. We also maintain a record of your product interests and your purchases online and in our stores. We may acquire customer names, email addresses and mailing addresses for select mailings from third parties.<br>
<br>
<b>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</b><br>
When you make an online purchase from Clubflyers.com, we use your information to process your order. We will also send you emails to confirm your order, and we may need to contact you via phone, postal mail or email if we have other questions regarding your order. In addition, you will be automatically signed up to receive email updates about our products, services, contests, and promotions.<br>
<br>

<b>THIRD PARTY TRANSACTIONS</b><br>
We contract with third parties to assist us in maintaining and managing our customer information to fulfill promotions and to communicate with our customers. We do not authorize any of those third parties to make any other use of your information.<br>
<br>
In addition, when we team up with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests or promotions, we and the other company may cross-reference our customer databases to identify common customers. We and the other company may use that existing information to identify future promotional opportunities and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations.<br>
<br>
When we offer contests and promotions, or join with other companies to do so, customers who choose to participate in those contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal information to participate. That information may then be used by us and any company offering the contest or promotion to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations.<br>
<br>
If prior to participating in a contest or promotion, you opted not to receive information from us, you may still receive information from or about Clubflyers.com in connection with the contest or promotion if you choose to participate in it. You may opt not to participate in these contests or promotions if you do not want to receive information about Clubflyers.com or share your information with us and the other companies sponsoring those contests or promotions.<br>
<br>
We also may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about you (such as age, gender, and types of products purchased) with our business partners to fulfill our contractual obligations. Except as described above, we do not share, rent or sell any information we collect online to any unaffiliated third party.<br>
