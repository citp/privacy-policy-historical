<h1>Club Monaco US Privacy Notice</h1>
<p>Effective Date: October 28, 2011</p>
<p>Club Monaco respects your privacy. Consistent with our commitment to providing you a satisfying and helpful shopping experience, we have found that collecting information from and about you through ClubMonaco.com, including our mobile website (the “Site”), and our Club Monaco stores (the “Stores”), helps us to better understand the products and services that are the most helpful to you. Our Privacy Notice describes the types of information we gather online and in our Stores and how we use, disclose and otherwise manage this information. Please read this Privacy Notice carefully. </p>
<p>By accessing the Site and providing information to us when shopping in our Stores, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Notice. This Privacy Notice may be updated from time to time. Accordingly, you should check the date of this Notice (which appears at the top of this page) and review any changes since the last version. Your continued use of the Site following any modifications demonstrates your agreement to such changes. If at any time you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Notice, please do not use this Site or provide us with personal information when shopping in our Stores. </p>

<hr>
<h1>Collection and Use of Information</h1>
<p>Club Monaco, or a third-party service provider acting on our behalf (“Service Provider”), may collect and use information from and about you as described below.</p>

<a name="personal-information"></a>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>Club Monaco may collect personal information from you in various ways, including when you (1) order products, gift cards or services from us; (2) register with us on our Site to shop or participate in our online community; (3) provide your information to us in a Store; (4) sign up for newsletters, email or other communications from Club Monaco; (5) participate in surveys, contests, sweepstakes or promotions; (6) utilize our Email to a Friend feature; or (6) request information from us or otherwise contact us. The personal information we collect may include your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, mobile telephone number, credit card number, birthday, gender and income.</p>
<p>We use information from and about you: (1) to fulfill orders, provide services and communicate with you; (2) to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products and services; (3) to respond to your inquiries; (4) to make promotional and marketing offers to you, and help us target specific products and services to you; and (5) to help us develop and improve our Site and Stores and tailor our Site and Stores to your interests. </p>
<p>Additionally, Club Monaco may combine your personal information with personal and nonperson information we receive from and about you from other online and offline sources.</p>

<a name="non-personal-information"></a>
<h3>Nonpersonal Information</h3>
<p>Club Monaco may collect nonpersonal information from you, including—but not limited to—your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, domain name from which you access the Site, service provider and mobile-device identifier, as well as information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you visited the Site, the areas or pages of the Site that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing the Site, the number of times you return to the Site and other Site usage data.</p>
<p>We use this information: (1) to review the usage and operations of our Site and services; (2) to address problems with our Site, our business or our products and services; and (3) to protect the security or integrity of the Site and our business.</p>
<p>For example, we use a service provider to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our Site. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our Site, products, offers or marketing strategy, you can opt out of this Site analysis tool by <a class="inner" href="http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/product" target="_target">clicking here</a>.</p>

<a name="cookies"></a>
<h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small data file that sites often store on your hard drive when you visit the Site. Club Monaco may place cookies on your computer to collect information about your visit to the Site and to improve Site functionality. For example, we may place cookies on your computer to understand which pages of the Site you’ve visited, determine which areas and features of our Site are most popular, learn how search engine referral is working effectively, provide unique user identification, preserve the contents of your shopping bag between your visits, and obtain product browsing and purchasing information. </p>
<p>You can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent, but if you turn off cookies or refuse them, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Site’s features, such as making a purchase on the Site or accessing your registered user account information. </p>
<p>A web beacon, also known as a clear GIF or pixel tag, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our Site or a third-party site where we may advertise, but not on your computer. When you access these pages, web beacons generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies, the web beacon will simply detect an anonymous site visit. We may also use cookies or web beacons to manage and deliver more relevant advertisements on the Site, across the Internet and via email. To learn more about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by our service providers, please <a class="inner" href="http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/product" target="_blank">click here</a>. Web beacons may also be used to report certain information (but not your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our Site and other sites that advertise and feature links to our Site, so that we can measure the effectiveness of our advertisements. Cookies or web beacons may also be used to let us know if you have opened an email from us. This information allows us to make improvements and updates to enhance your experience. </p>

<hr>
<a name="sharing"></a>
<h1>Sharing Information With Third Parties </h1>
<p>Club Monaco does not share, sell or trade your personal information gathered online with third parties for their marketing purposes, except with your consent or as described in this Privacy Notice. Further, Club Monaco does not contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give third parties access to such personal information. </p>
<p>We may share your information with our service providers that provide internal business, professional or technical support functions for Club Monaco.</p>
<p>Club Monaco may share your personal information if such action is required for Club Monaco or any of our service providers to comply with any valid legal process, such as a subpoena, search warrant, statute or court order, or any valid administrative or investigative request from a law-enforcement agency. In addition, we may share your personal information if we or any of our service providers believes that such disclosure is necessary to address any unlawful acts or acts that may endanger the health or safety of another customer or of the general public. </p>
<p>Club Monaco may also share nonpersonally identifiable or anonymous information about you, such as age, gender, types of products viewed, frequency of Store visits, Site pages you access most frequently or search terms you enter with third parties. For example, Club Monaco may provide a third party with such information as the number of people who shopped at our Site during a specific time period or the number of people who shopped at our Stores and meet certain demographics (e.g., age or gender) during a specific time period. This nonpersonally identifiable or anonymous information does not personally identify a specific visitor to our Site or Stores.</p>
<p>During the normal course of our business, Club Monaco may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or any of our assets, information we have collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be considered an asset of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties.</p>

<hr>
<a name="sharing"></a>
<h1>Security</h1>
<p>Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We have taken certain physical, administrative and technical steps to safeguard the information we collect from and about our customers and Site visitors. For example, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. While we make every effort to help ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee our security measures. </p>

<h1>Children and Privacy </h1>
<p>Club Monaco is concerned about protecting children’s privacy. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be familiar with the sites their children visit. Our Site is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13.

<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>Club Monaco provides information in its U.S. Privacy Notice available at <a href="http://www.ClubMonaco.com/helpdesk/index.jsp?display=safety&amp;subdisplay=restrictions#restrictions">http://www.ClubMonaco.com/helpdesk/index.jsp?display=safety&amp;subdisplay=restrictions#restrictions</a> and in this Policy regarding its practices related to Personal Data collected on the Site, including the purposes for which Club Monaco collects and uses such information.  Relevant details also may be found in privacy notices pertaining to specific data processing activities.  </p>
<h2>Choice</h2>
<p>Club Monaco offers Consumers the opportunity to choose whether Club Monaco may (i) disclose their Personal Data to certain third parties or (ii) use their Personal Data for purposes incompatible with the purposes for which the information was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.  Consumers may contact Club Monaco as indicated below regarding the company’s use or disclosure of their Personal Data.  </p>
<p>Club Monaco may disclose Personal Data without offering an opportunity to opt out (i) to service providers the company has retained to perform services on its behalf, (ii) if it is required to do so by law or legal process, (iii) to law enforcement or other government authorities, or (iv) when Club Monaco believes disclosure is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

Should such a sale or transfer occur, Club Monaco will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use the Personal Data in a manner that is consistent with Club Monaco’s privacy policies.  Club Monaco uses Personal Data only for the purposes indicated in its U.S. Privacy Notice or this Policy unless it has a legal basis, such as consent, to use it for other purposes.  To the extent required by law, Club Monaco obtains prior opt-in consent at the time of collection for the processing of Personal Data for marketing purposes.  </p>

Except as permitted or required by applicable law, Club Monaco requires third parties to whom it discloses Personal Data and who are not subject to the European Union Data Protection Directive 95/46 or an adequacy finding to either (i) subscribe to the relevant Safe Harbor principles or (ii) contractually agree to provide at least the same level of protection for Personal Data as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor principles.  </p>
<h2>Access</h2>
<p>Where appropriate, Club Monaco provides Consumers with reasonable access to the Personal Data Club Monaco maintains about them.  Club Monaco also provides a reasonable opportunity for Consumers to correct, amend or delete that information where it is inaccurate, as appropriate.
