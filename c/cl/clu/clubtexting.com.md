# Privacy Policy

CallFire Inc. ("CallFire") is committed to protecting the privacy of your information. This Privacy Statement describes our information practices for our publicly-accessible websites, including our use of cookies to collect data about your use of our websites. For information about our privacy policies governing your use of CallFire’s account portal and associated platform services (“Services”), please consult our separate CallFire Services Privacy Policy.

**1\. Websites Covered**

In this Privacy Statement, “we,” “us,” “our,” or “CallFire” refers to CallFire and our affiliates, which includes any person or entity that controls CallFire, is controlled by CallFire, or is under common control with CallFire (such as a subsidiary, parent company, or employee). This Privacy Statement covers CallFire’s information practices for our family of websites (collectively, “CallFire Sites”). In addition to CallFire.com, CallFire operates other websites like MoboMix.com, EZTexting.com, GroupTexting.com, TellMyCell.com, NightLifeTexting.com, and ClubTexting.com. This Privacy Statement applies equally to any rebranded or white label version of CallFire’s platform services.

**2\. Information CallFire Collects From You**

CallFire collects information from individuals who visit any of our Sites ("Visitors"), as, well as from individuals who have registered to use our platform services (“Customers”). Some information is collected from both Visitors and Customers using commonly-used information-gathering tools. It includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, and the actions you take on the CallFire Sites (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked). This information is collectively called “Website Navigational Information.” CallFire collects your Website Navigational Information using these methods:

**Cookies**

CallFire uses cookies to make your interactions with our Sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of our Sites, CallFire's servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to CallFire by, for example, responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (like a "Contact Me" or a "30-Day Free Trial" Web form), you remain anonymous when visiting our Sites.

There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.

If you have chosen to identify yourself to CallFire, we can uniquely identify you as you navigate our Sites by using session cookies containing encrypted information. For example, each time you request a free trial or promotion by providing your contact information or each time you login to your account portal, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to you is placed on your browser. It enables us to process your online requests and to uniquely identify who is logged into the Service. Session cookies are required to use our Services,  **and we do not recognize do-not-track requests for them.**

CallFire uses persistent cookies that only we can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the CallFire Sites. When you purchase our Services or otherwise provide us with your personal information, a unique identifier associated with a persistent cookie placed on your Web browser is assigned to you. **We do not respond to do-not-track requests with respect to persistent cookies.**

We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies.

**Third Party Cookies**

From time-to-time, CallFire engages third parties to track and analyze nonpersonally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from Visitors and Customers who visit our Sites. CallFire also uses other third-party cookies to track the performance of our advertisements.

**Web Beacons**

CallFire uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors' usage of our Sites and your interactions with emails that we have sent you. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you have viewed a particular Website tied to the Web beacon. For example, CallFire sometimes places Web beacons in marketing emails that notify us when you click on the link in the email that directs you to one of our CallFire Sites. CallFire uses Web beacons to operate and improve our Sites and email communications.

**IP Addresses**

When you visit our Sites, we collect your Internet Protocol ("IP") address to track and aggregate your non-personally identifiable information. For example, we use IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate our Sites.
