		Privacy Policy for ClubTexting.com:</h1>
		<span class="body_text">
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Thank you for visiting our site at www.clubtexting.com ("Web Site"). Your privacy is important to us and we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the collection and use of the personal information you submit at this site. This policy applies only to Club Texting`s treatment of personally identifiable information collected through our Web Site.</p>
		  <p>If you are visiting our site from outside the United States, please be advised that because we operate internationally, and certain of our computer systems are currently based in the United States, your personal data will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. By using the Web Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country, and you also consent to Club Texting using your personal information to contact you electronically, in writing, or otherwise to provide notices relating to your use of the Web Site and to give you information about the products and services offered by Club Texting and its affiliates. Club Texting may store your information beyond this date if that is required by law or contract.</p>
		  <p class="anchor_text">Information Collection &amp; Use of Collected Information</p>

		  <p>We may use such personally identifiable information to provide the information or content you have requested (e.g., fulfill your orders for our ringtones, games, data and news), to contact you about programs, products, features or services in which we believe you may be interested (such as future promotional materials), or for other purposes disclosed from time to time. We also may use your personally identifiable information to contact you regarding your use of our Web Site or changes to our privacy notice, Terms of Service, or other policies or terms that affect you and your use of our Web Site. In addition, we may use information collected about our users to improve the content and navigation of our Web Site, or for other internal purposes.</p>
		  <p>We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect from you with outside records (e.g., information we obtain from other companies, including wireless providers) to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
		  <p>To fulfill your requests for products and services (e.g., provide you with content via your cell phone), we may share the personally identifiable information you provide with your cell phone service provider or their partner and subcontractor companies. Our privacy policy does not cover such entities use of information. To learn more about your provider’s privacy practices, you should consult its privacy policy.

		  <p>In addition, we may disclose personally identifiable information collected about you at this site in the following instances:</p>
		  <p><strong>Legal Action:</strong> We may disclose information about our users, including personally identifiable information, when requested by governmental or quasi-governmental authorities conducting an investigation, hearing or the like, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Web Site and applicable laws, or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web Site. We also may disclose user information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability; to protect or defend our rights or property; or protect the safety, rights, or property of our users.</p>
		  <p><strong>Corporate Change:</strong> We may sell, transfer, or otherwise disclose user information, including personally identifiable information, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of substantially all assets, or other corporate change respecting the Web Site.</p>
