              </div>
              <p><strong>4. Cookies</strong><br>
                We use cookies to make interactions with the Company's Website easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Company's Websites, our servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to us, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a "Contact Me" or a "30 Day Free Trial" Web form), you remain anonymous to the Company.</p>
            <p class="body-text"><br>
              There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.</p>
            <p class="body-text">If you have chosen to identify yourself to us, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Service, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed on your browser. These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Service and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Service and the Company does not recognize do-not-track requests with respect to Session cookies.</p>
                        <p class="body-text">
We use persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Company's Websites. When you purchase the Service or provide the Company with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company places on your Web browser. The Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your Web browser's ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company's Web sites, but you will not be able to successfully use the Service. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a persistent cookie, or you may choose to block persistent cookies with your browser. Additionally, we will not place persistent cookies on any computer where the browser provides a “do-not-track” signal. However, if your settings block cookies and tracking, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users to our Site.
</p>

            <p class="body-text">

We may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with Data about our Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Service.
</p>

<p class="body-text">
<strong> Third Party Cookies </strong></p><p class="body-text">
From time-to-time, we engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from individuals who visit the Company's Web sites. We may also use other third-party cookies to track the performance of Company advertisements. The information provided to third parties does not include personal information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after the Company receives it. This Privacy Statement does not cover the use of third party cookies. We will not place third-party cookies on any computer where the browser provides a “do-not-track” signal.
</p>
              <p><strong>5. Web Beacons</strong><br>
                Our third party  advertising partners employ a software technology called clear gifs  (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site  by informing us what content is effective.&nbsp;  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in  function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web  users.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are  stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on  Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We  do not tie  the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally  identifiable information. </p>

              <p>Club Texting is not responsible for the content of linked  third-party sites and does not make any representations regarding the content  or accuracy of materials on such third-party sites.&nbsp; Club Texting has not  taken any steps to confirm the accuracy or reliability of any of the  information contained in such third-party sites.&nbsp; If you decide to access  linked third-party sites, you do so at you own risk.

              <p><strong>11. Data Security </strong><br>
                The importance of security for all personally-identifiable information  associated with visitors to the Website—as well as Club Texting customer  information, such as cell phone numbers, texts, messages and other account  data—is of utmost concern to Club Texting, and we have implemented, and  periodically review, certain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to  help prevent unauthorized access and maintain data security. Unfortunately, due  to the open nature of Internet communications, no data transmission over the  Internet can be guaranteed to be secure, and thus we cannot guarantee that  communications between you and Club Texting will be free from unauthorized access  by third parties. Visitors of the Website and Club Texting customers use the  Website at their own risk.</p>
              <p><strong>12. Your Acceptance of These Terms </strong><br>
                By accessing the Website, you signify your assent to the Club Texting Privacy  Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access the  Website. You should visit this page periodically, as we may, from time to time,  update this Privacy Policy and such changes shall be effectively immediately  upon posting on the Website and without further notice to you.&nbsp; Your  continued access to the Website following the posting of changes to this  Privacy Policy shall be deemed an acceptance of such changes by you.&nbsp; Club  Texting will, however, use personally-identifiable information only in  accordance with the version of the Privacy Policy under which the information  was collected. </p>
              <p><strong>13. Changes in This Privacy Policy</strong><br>
                We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to  our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you  by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of  a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.
