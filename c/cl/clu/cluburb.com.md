CLUBURB.COM takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines how we treat any personal or business information we collect when you visit our Web Site and/or register with us for using special features.

**Personal Information:** ClubUrb may collect your personal information such as your name, sex, age, e-mail, phone number, address and photos in order to provide you special features such as commenting, sharing or other forms of activity which need user participation.

**Non-Personal Information :** ClubUrb may also request non-personally identifiable information, such as annual income, buying preferences, or age, also known as demographic and profile data. Though this information is optional, we may use it to improve our Web Site and/or tailor your experience on our Web Site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in and displaying content according to your preferences. We may also share this information with others, such as advertisers interested in advertising in the ClubUrb e-mail or on the Web Site, in aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any other person.

**Disclosure of Information :** We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of personal information, we have put in place suitable procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect on the Web Site.

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., username, password, email, phone number) via reviews, comments, or other postings on the Web Site, that information can be collected and used by third parties and could result in unsolicited messages from other users or third parties. Such activities are beyond control of ClubUrb and we assume no responsibility in such circumstances.

Upon your request, we can provide you with a summary of the information we collect about you. You will have the opportunity to correct, update or modify this information.

We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights.

**Security:** It is our intent to keep secure any personal information you submit to us, and we will continue to take steps to maintain the security of our site and your personal information. All user accounts at ClubUrb are password-protected. We restrict the access to your personal information to only authorized personnel.

While we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosure of information, we cannot assure you that your personal information will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with our Privacy Policy. The open nature of the Internet is such that data may flow over networks without security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended. Therefore, in submitting your personal information to this Web Site, you assume the risk of a third party obtaining that information.

You hereby acknowledge that ClubUrb is not responsible for a third party accessing your personal information in such a manner, and you release us from all claims arising out of any use of such information in an unauthorized manner.
