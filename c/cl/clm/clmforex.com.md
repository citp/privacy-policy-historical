 **When We Disclose Your Personal Information and Who May We Disclose it to, Including Cross Border Disclosures.**

      * your professional advisers, including your solicitor or accountant as authorised by you;
      * information technology service providers to maintain, review and develop our business systems, procedures and infrastructure including testing or upgrading our computer systems;

Our ability to enforce the Australian Privacy Principles or any other contractual privacy obligation against overseas recipients and to take action in relation to any breach may be very limited and/or far less effective than it would be if such recipients were Australian based.

 **Spam Act**

Spam is a generic term used to describe electronic ‘junk mail’- unwanted messages sent to a person’s email account or mobile phone. In Australia, spam is defined as ‘unsolicited commercial electronic messages’.

‘Electronic messaging’ covers emails, instant messaging, SMS and other mobile phone messaging, but not cover normal voice-to-voice communication by telephone.

Equally importantly, **Core Liquidity Markets** makes sure that our practices are in accordance with the National Privacy Principles in all activities where they deal with personal information. Personal information includes our clients contact details.

**Internal Procedure for dealing with communications**

The three key steps **Core Liquidity Markets** follows:

  * Consent – Only commercial electronic messages are sent with the addressee’s consent – either express or inferred consent.
  * Identify – Electronic messages will include clear and accurate information about the person and the company that is responsible for sending the commercial electronic message.
  * Unsubscribe – We ensure that a functional unsubscribe facility is included in all our commercial electronic messages and deal with unsubscribe requests promptly.



 **Consented to such communications**

Commercial messages will only be sent to you when you have given consent. This may be express consent – a direct indication that it is okay to send the message, or messages of that nature or inferred consent based on our business or other relationship with you and your conduct.

 **Comply with the law regarding viral messages**

 **Core Liquidity Markets** ensures that Commercial Communications that include a Forwarding Facility contain a clear recommendation that the Recipient should only forward the Commercial Communication to persons with whom they have a relationship, where that relationship means that person could be said to have consented to receiving Commercial Communications.

 **Comply with the age sensitive content of commercial communication**

Where the content of a Commercial Communication seeks to promote or inspire interaction with a product, service or event that is age sensitive, the **Core Liquidity Markets** takes reasonable steps to ensure that such content is sent to Recipients who are legally entitled to use or participate in the product service or event.
