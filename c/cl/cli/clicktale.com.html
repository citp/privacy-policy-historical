Please don’t send us any communication which contains confidential information. Since we are not able to evaluate whether such communication contains confidential information or not, we may retain or use such confidential information as aforesaid and such retention or use shall not be deemed as a breach of any of our obligations herein.  <br>
</p>

<h2>3.	Information security</h2>
<p>
ClickTale maintains a strict "no-spam" policy. Your e-mail address will not be sold to a third party. <br>
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.

<h2>4.	Information access and correction </h2>
<p>
When you use ClickTale, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal information. <br>
We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. <br>

If ClickTale becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. <br>
We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as average page load time, or the number of pages processed per day. Such information does not identify you individually. <br>
