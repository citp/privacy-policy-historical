<p>Our servers automatically collect site use information, each time the user visits our site.</p>
<p>The site use information includes, but is not limited to, the following: the domain names, operating system in use (e.g. Macintosh, Windows), browser (e.g. Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer) and version, the website which referred the user to us, and other similar information. This information may be aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on our website, pages viewed, time and date of visits, and other similar information. We may use and disclose site use information, for example, to measure the use of our website, improve the content, explain the utility of our website and services we provide, and to extend their functionality. Similar to other commercial websites, the technology called "cookies" may be used to provide the user with tailored information. A cookie is a small piece of data that a website can send to the user's browser, which may then be stored on their hard drive, so we can recognize the user when they return.

Our cookies collect general information that enhances our ability to serve the user and measure the utility of our website.</p>
<p>A cookie cannot read personal data off a hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites; indeed, the only Personal Information a cookie can contain is information the user supplies himself?. Accepting the cookies used on our website may give us access to information about the user's browsing behavior, which we may use to personalize their experience and track user traffic patterns, and to merge this info when the user registers. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. The user may browse most of ClickMeeting's website without accepting cookies from ClickMeeting; however, some website functionality may be lost by the user disabling cookies on their computer. Information we collect may be used to enhance the use of our website, and to provide the user with a service that they ordered, arrange the website in the most customer friendly way, communicate special offers and featured items, and/or respond to any questions and suggestions.</p>
<p>In the case of an agreement, personal information includes data that identifies the user as the specific individual, i.e. name, email address, phone number, geographical address, and/or company name and company address. This information is used to complete the account application process, customer's information request, and/or to verify the validity of the request, and to process payment.</p>
<p>We will use this information solely for processing payments for services that are ordered.</p>
<p>Implix collects only personal information that the user chooses to provide voluntarily registering to our ClickMeeting Service. Implix shall advise the user which information is mandatory to provide and what they do not have to enclose.</p>

<p>Implix recognizes the importance of respecting the privacy of those who decided to entrust their sensitive information with the user. We make every effort to safeguard their security.

<h3 class="cufFont">Information Security</h3>
<p>We believe that keeping Personal Information secure is one of our most significant responsibilities.</p>
<p>We restrict access to Personal Information about the user to those employees and others who need to know that information to assist us in our business, or to provide products or services to the user. We safeguard personal information, according to the established security standards and procedures, by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to the personal data information.</p>
<p>When we request users or customers to enter sensitive information, such as their name, geographical address, email address, and a credit card number, it is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry SSL and processed through a reputable payment processor. While on the secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon at the bottom of web browsers, e.g. Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer, becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open, when the user is just 'surfing'.</p>
<p>All of our users' and customers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g. our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are personally granted access to sensitive information.</p>
<p>We do not sell or rent the user's Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes unless they have granted us permission to do so.</p>
<p>We may share the user's Personal Information within other services of Implix for purposes of data processing or storage.</p>
<p>We may also share the user's Personal Information with business partners, service vendors, authorized third-party agents or contractors in order to provide a requested Service or transaction, including processing orders, processing credit card transactions, hosting websites, hosting event and seminar registration and providing customer support. We only provide these third parties with the minimum amount of Personal Information necessary to complete/utilize the requested Service or transaction, and the third parties are not permitted to use the user's Personal Information except for the limited purpose of completing/providing the requested Service or transaction.</p>
<p>We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal processes by disclosing the user's Personal Information and other related information, if necessary. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
<p>We will ask for the user's consent before we use or share their information for any purpose other than the reason they provided or as otherwise provided by this policy. In order for us to know the user's preferences, we will require an action on their part, such as checking the appropriate option, to indicate their consent.</p>

Any data transmissions the user makes over the Internet are done so at their own risk. Once we receive the data transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its security and privacy on our systems.</p>
