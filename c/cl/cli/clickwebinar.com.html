            <h1 class="font-cm-light">Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Effective Date: 07/08/2013</p><p>This Privacy Policy statement discloses the privacy practices for ClickMeeting Service and ClickWebinar Service (hereinafter referred to as "Service"), hosted by GetResponse sp.z.o.o. hereinafter referred to as "GetResponse".</p><p>The Service is an online service which enables Users to have video and audio conferences, collaborate on documents, deliver presentations, perform product demonstrations and securely share confidential information from anywhere, anytime.</p><p>GetResponse realizes that you care how your information is processed and shared, and we appreciate your trust in us to do that carefully and sensibly. This document describes our Privacy Policy. By registering your details with us you confirm that you have read, understood and agreed to the provisions of this Privacy Policy and to our <a href="http://www.clickmeeting.com/terms_and_conditions.html">Terms of Service</a>. Terms which are not defined in this Privacy Policy and are written in capitals shall have their meaning specified in the <a href="http://www.clickmeeting.com/terms_and_conditions.html">Terms of Service</a>. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy the term "User" shall not only mean the "User" in accordance with the provisions of Terms of Service, but also every person visiting ClickMeeting or ClickWebinar website.</p><p>We believe it is important to you, the User, to know how we treat the information about you which we receive during your visits to our site. This Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, disclose, and safeguard the aggregate information we receive when you visit and browse our website. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.</p><p>GetResponse has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy-program-requirements/"> TRUSTe's program requirements</a> including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. The TRUSTe program does not cover information that may be collected through downloadable software. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through the websites: <a href="http://www.clickmeeting.com/">www.clickmeeting.com</a> and <a href="http://www.clickwebinar.com/">www.clickwebinar.com</a>.</p><p>TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions.<em>If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at</em> <a href="mailto:support@clickmeeting.com">support@clickmeeting.com</a>. If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">TRUSTe here</a>.</p><p>We encourage you to take the time to read this Privacy Policy as well as those of any other sites you visit, whether through a link on that site or otherwise.</p><h2>Information We Collect</h2><p>GetResponse collects personal information from Users who visit this Site and use our Service. Because of the nature of our Service we must collect from Users personal information such as (at the minimum): (i) first and last name, (ii) username, (iii) an email address to be used as a login, (iv) password, (v) billing information such as billing address and credit card information where necessary, (vi) phone, (vii) country, (viii) address, city, state, zip.</p><p>We may also ask Users to provide additional personal information such as (i) company name, (ii) title, (iii) educational institution and (iv) other company and (v) personal details that the User may opt out of by not entering data when asked. GetResponse uses the User's registration information to authenticate Users and provide access to the Service. GetResponse also uses the email addresses used in the registration information to communicate with our Users. From time to time, GetResponse may contact the User via email to notify them of changes to its Service, scheduled maintenance, information about GetResponse and promotional material from GetResponse.</p><p>With active consent, the User's email address can be used to send them newsletters from GetResponse. Users can opt out of such emails at anytime by contacting us, but they will still receive emails such as receipts, confirmation emails and customer Service updates, and other necessary information to provide the Service to the User.</p><p>The User agrees and acknowledges that their information collected through our websites and related Services may be transferred across national boundaries and stored and processed in any of the countries around the world in which GetResponse maintains offices and data centers, including the United States.</p><p>Information that is provided by meeting organizers such as: User name, email address and any other business contact and meeting subject contact <strong>are considered confidential to the User</strong>. When the Participants register with one of our Users for an online transmission, that information is provided to the User. GetResponse may store that information to fulfill our obligations to our Users. GetResponse will not use the information to send marketing information for GetResponse services or third party offers to the Participants. The User and Participants should be aware that any personal information they submit while in-session and chatting can be read, collected or used by the User and other Participants. GetResponse will not view information except as necessary to appropriately support the Service.</p><p>GetResponse collects only personal information that the User chooses to provide voluntarily registering to our ClickMeeting Service. GetResponse shall advise the User which information is mandatory to provide and what they do not have to enclose.</p><h2>Passwords</h2><p>The User's Account information, username, password and user profile are password-protected so that they have secure access to entering and editing personal data. It is the User's responsibility to protect the security of their password. Access to the Service is protected by a unique username and password that is known to the User only. GetResponse has designed internal security processes that encrypt the User's password to protect it from being divulged or accessed by anyone other than the User. Neither GetResponse employees nor any of its contractors can obtain or access to the User's password. Neither GetResponse employees or nor any of its contractors will ask the User for their password via mail, email, telephone or in any other unsolicited manner.</p><h2>User Access and Choice</h2><p>If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, remove or request deletion by making the change on our member information page, by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@clickmeeting.com">support@clickmeeting.com</a> or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.</p><p>We will retain your information for as long needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. GetResponse is required to store all personal data of the User and all information regarding the User's Account (together with all Conference data, the Content, email messages, statistics, Users and Participants’ data) during 60 days (in case of free of charge Account) or during 90 days (in case of payable Account) upon the Account is cancelled or the Service (Agreement) is terminated. GetResponse will not process above data for other purposes than storage of the data only, subject to binding legal provisions or obligations imposed on GetResponse by public authorities. GetResponse shall store the above data only in order to resume the User's Account by the User in accordance with the Terms of Service and to perform its duties specified in binding legal provisions or imposed on GetResponse by public authorities. As of the date on which the above terms (60 or 90 days) expire, GetResponse shall cease to process the data and all data shall be permanently deleted form the Service.</p><p>We will ask for the User's consent before we use or share their information for any purpose other than the reason they provided or as otherwise provided by this policy. In order for us to know the User's preferences, we will require an action on their part, such as checking the appropriate option, to indicate their consent.</p><h2>Mailing Policy</h2><p>When the User sends us an email, we use their email address to thank them for their comment and/or reply to their question, and we will store their communication and our reply for any future correspondence. Beyond our initial reply, we will never use the User's email address to send them any unsolicited message or information, nor will we share it with or sell it to anyone else for such use.</p><p>When the User agrees to receive marketing information about services and products of GetResponse or our commercial partners, we use their email address and any other information they give us to provide them with the information about  services and products of GetResponse or our commercial partners, until they ask us to stop (using the 'unsubscribe' instructions provided with each email, and/or on the site where they signed up, and/or as we otherwise provide).</p><p>We will never use the User's email address or other information to provide them with any unsolicited messages or information (unless that is part of the service they are requesting).</p><h2>Information Sharing</h2><p>We do not sell or rent the User's Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes unless they have granted us permission to do so.</p><p>We may share the User's Personal Information within other services of GetResponse for purposes of data processing or storage. We may also share the user's Personal Information with business partners, service vendors, authorized third-party agents or contractors in order to provide a requested Service or transaction, including processing orders, processing credit card transactions, hosting websites, hosting event and seminar registration and providing customer support. We only provide these third parties with the minimum amount of Personal Information necessary to complete/utilize the requested Service or transaction, and the third parties are not permitted to use the User's Personal Information except for the limited purpose of completing/providing the requested Service or transaction.</p><p>We may also disclose your personal information:</p><p>- as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process,</p><p>- if for any reason we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,</p><p>- if GetResponse is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p><h2>Tracking Technologies</h2><p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information about visitors to our site automatically and store it in log files.</p><p>The site use information includes, but is not limited to, the following: the domain names, operating system in use (e.g. Macintosh, Windows), browser (e.g. Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer) and version, the website which referred the User to us, and other similar information. This information may be aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on our website, pages viewed, time and date of visits, and other similar information. We may use and disclose site use information, for example, to measure the use of our website, improve the content, explain the utility of our website and services we provide, and to extend their functionality.</p><p>Similar to other commercial websites, the technology called "cookies" may be used to provide the User with tailored information. A cookie is a small piece of data that a website can send to the User's browser, which may then be stored on their hard drive, so we can recognize the user when they return. The User may be able to set their browser to notify them when they receive a cookie. Our cookies collect general information that enhances our ability to serve the User and measure the utility of our website.</p><p>A cookie cannot read personal data off a hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites; indeed, the only Personal Information a cookie can contain is information the User supplies him or herself. Accepting the cookies used on our website may give us access to information about the User's browsing behavior, which we may use to personalize their experience and track user traffic patterns, and to merge this info when the user registers. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our Users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information.</p><p>The User may browse most of Service's website without accepting cookies; however, some website functionality may be lost by the User disabling cookies on their computer. Information we collect may be used to enhance the use of our website, and to provide the User with a service that they ordered, arrange the website in the most customer friendly way, communicate special offers and featured items, and/or respond to any questions and suggestions.</p><p>The use of cookies by any partners, affiliates, tracking utility company or service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p><h2>Web Beacons</h2><p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a User’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personal information.</p><h2>Information Security</h2><p>We believe that keeping Personal Information secure is one of our most significant responsibilities.</p><p>GetResponse recognizes the importance of respecting the privacy of those who decided to entrust their sensitive information with the User. We make every effort to safeguard their security. GetResponse will never use the information about the Participants that Users collect within our Services to send any information other than expressly provided by their Participants, nor will we share it with or sell it to anyone else for such use.</p><p>We restrict access to Personal Information about the User to those employees and others who need to know that information to assist us in our business, or to provide products or services to the user. We safeguard personal information, according to the established security standards and procedures, by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to the personal data information.</p><p>All of our Users' and customers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g. our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are personally granted access to sensitive information.</p><p>When we request Users or customers to enter sensitive information, such as their name, geographical address, email address, and a credit card number, it is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry SSL and processed through a reputable payment processor. While on the secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon at the bottom of web browsers, e.g. Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer, becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open, when the User is just 'surfing'.</p><p>GetResponse stores its servers in a highly secure server environment, with surveillance and support to prevent unauthorized access and maintain data security.</p><p>We cannot guarantee the security of the User's data while it is being transmitted over the Internet and through servers that are beyond our control. We strive to protect the User's personal information but GetResponse cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information they transmit to our website or Services. Any data transmissions the User makes over the Internet are done so at their own risk. Once we receive the data transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its security and privacy on our systems.</p><p>Service in-meeting information is encrypted from the beginning till the end and only accessible by the User and Participants. "In-meeting information" includes all screen sharing data and chat information. Information about scheduled meetings and meetings such as time, organizer, subject of meeting, are placed on our web site and are available to the User and logged Participants that received an invitation from the User via email or other means of communication.</p><h2>Additional Information</h2><ul><li><h3>- Blog/Forum</h3><p>Our Web site offers a publicly accessible blog.
