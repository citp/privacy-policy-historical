# Privacy Policy | Climate Reality

The Alliance for Climate Protection d/b/a The Climate Reality Project (“[The Climate Reality Project](http://climaterealityproject.org/),” “we,” “our," or “us”) is very sensitive to online privacy concerns. This online privacy statement describes how we treat all user data collected during your visit to The Climate Reality Project’s websites (collective, including [climaterealityproject.org](http://climaterealityproject.org/), [24hoursofreality.com](http://24hoursofreality.org/event/post/), [climaterealitytraining.org](http://www.climaterealitytraining.org/), [whatilove.org](http://www.whatilove.org/), [climatespeakers.org](http://climatespeakers.org/), [worldseasiestdecision.org](http://worldseasiestdecision.org/) domain names) (“Website”). 

**COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION**  

On this Website, you can request more information about our goals and programs, download materials, view how many other people are taking “action,” and enjoy other interactive services. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected on these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, and information about your preferences. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the site or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. 

Aspects of our Website allow you to log in using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect, Twitter, or Google+ (the “Sign-In Services”). These Sign-In-Services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form. The Sign-In Services give you the option to post information about your activities on this Website to your profile page to share with others within your network. You may request that we delete any information obtained through these Sign-In Services by filling out the form [here](http://tcrp.salsalabs.com/o/2168/p/salsa/web/common/public/signup?signup_page_KEY=5939). 

**PRIVACY OF OUR E-MAIL LIST AND PERSONAL INFORMATION**

The Climate Reality Project maintains an e-mail list to keep interested parties informed about its programs. Individuals can unsubscribe from the e-mail list at anytime. We collect and use your personal information to operate the Website and to deliver any services you have requested. These services may include the display of customized content based upon the information we have collected (for example, special information for users living in a particular region or state). 

Only The Climate Reality Project staff and our authorized agents have access to personally identifiable information provided by visitors to this Website in order to better serve you. People who affirmatively submit their contact information through the Website may be contacted by The Climate Reality Project staff or authorized agents. 

We do not share the information you’ve given us with unaffiliated groups without your explicit permission. We may share some of your personal information with the following affiliated groups: 

     • Affiliated Third Parties – for example, our database administrators (for the sole purpose of helping us do our work) or affiliated campaigns, which share our mission and privacy concerns. 

     • Third Party Administrators, such as organizations we engage to facilitate large distribution of messages. 

**COLLECTION AND USE OF CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION**  

We do not solicit personally identifying information from children. Visitors who are under 13 years of age should ask their parent or legal guardian for assistance when using the Website and should not submit any personally identifying information to the Website. 

**USE OF COOKIES**

We may use cookies to tailor your experience on this Website according to the preferences you have specified. When you visit the Website, your browser may save a tiny piece of information on your computer. This information personalizes and improves your experience online. It is not possible and we do not attempt to access information from other websites. Our cookies do not contain any personal identifiable information. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you chose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience all features of climaterealityproject.org. 

When you visit the website or join our email list we automatically collect cookies to update our “progress pulse” and other interactive features of the website. The “progress pulse” allows website users to view aggregate information about different actions website users have completed. No personal information will be displayed to the public for the Progress Pulse. 

We may incorporate TakePart’s Action Widgets supplied by TakePart, LLC (“TakePart”) into our content, which provides you the ability to interact with TakePart and its third parties’ content to engage in social actions (e.g., signing a petition, donating to charity) (the “Widget”).  When you interact with the Widget, TakePart and third parties it works with may associate cookies or other technologies with your device to collect certain information when you visit our web site, such as device or other persistent identifiers and information about your usage of the Widget and across various web sites you may visit that also contain the Widget.  TakePart may use such information during your visits to this and other web sites in order to serve you content likely to be of greater interest to you.  TakePart’s privacy policy is available at [http://www.takepart.com/privacy-policy](http://www.takepart.com/privacy-policy) and their privacy policy, not ours, governs its data practices.

**IP ADDRESSES, LOG FILES, AND DATA ANALYSIS  **

As with any website operator, we analyze our Website logs to constantly improve the value of our Website. We use an external service to provide real-time reporting to us and our authorized agents of browser accesses to our Website. This includes page views, unique visitors, repeat visitors, frequency of visits, and peak-volume traffic periods. We do not use this service to gather, request, record, require, collect, or track any Internet users’ personally identifiable information. 

We log IP addresses which describe the location of your computer or network on the Internet. This information is helpful for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We may also use third-party services such as Google Analytics. These practices help us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems with our Website. We may also use embedded images in e-mails to track open rates for our mailings. This practice helps us determine which mailings appeal most to our members. 

URLs contained in e-mails may contain an ID that enables us to correctly identify the person who takes an action using a web page. We use URLs to simplify the process of signing petitions and filling out surveys. We may occasionally present a shortened URL that references a longer URL which contains an ID. We do this to simplify the display, to prevent links from becoming broken when copied, and to ensure compatibility with e-mail programs which do not handle long URLs. When shortened URL is displayed in an e-mail, you will see the full URL in the browser’s address bar when you access the page. 

**PETITIONS AND SURVEYS**

For petitions and surveys you’ve signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and comments as public information – for example, we may provide compilations of petitions, with your comments, to the intended recipient of the petition or survey. We will not make your street address publicly available, but we may transmit it to the intended recipient of the petition or survey as part of the petition or survey. This is standard industry practice in such situations. In no such case will we disclose your e-mail address or phone number, without your permission. We may also make your comments, along with your first name, city and state available to the press and public online. 

**CHANGES TO THIS STATEMENT**

We may occasionally update this privacy statement especially as new features are added to this Website. If there are material changes to this statement or in how we will use your personal information, we will prominently note such changes prior to their implementation. We encourage you to periodically review this page and the Website’s Terms of Use to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
