# Privacy | ClickTime Web Timesheet

## ClickTime is committed to your privacy

The developers of ClickTime have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the protection of your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices.

## Introduction

Content and information submitted by users to ClickTime is referred to in this policy as " **Customer Data** ". Customer Data is controlled by the organization or other third party that purchased the ClickTime services (the " **Customer** "). Where ClickTime collects or processes Customer Data, it does so on behalf of the Customer.

If you are using ClickTime by invitation of a Customer, whether that Customer is your employer, another organization, or an individual, you are an "End-user." That Customer is the sole owner of the data submitted to ClickTime.

## Information Collected

**Account and Registration Information** : We ask for and may collect personal information about you such as your name, address, phone number, email address, and credit card information, as well as certain related information like your company name when you register for an account or utilize ClickTime.

If you sign-up for a free trial Account, you are not required to enter your credit card information unless and until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to our services. A third-party intermediary is used to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information for any purpose except for credit card processing on our behalf.

We refer to any information described above as “Account Information” for the purposes of this Policy. By voluntarily providing us with **Account Information** , you represent that you are the owner of such personal data or otherwise have the requisite consent to provide it to us.

**Services Usage Information** : This is information about how you are accessing and using the services, which may include administrative and support communications with us, information about account configuration, custom fields, and preferences.

**Contact Information** : With your permission, any contact information you choose to import (manually or otherwise).

**Device Information** : When you download and use our services, we automatically collect information on the type of device and operating system version you use.

## Use and Disclosure

When you complete one of our online forms, such as a registration or marketing form, it is required that you provide contact information (such as your name, email address, address, company name, role, etc.). We use your contact information from these forms to:

  * Send you information so that you may access demo accounts and set up a ClickTime account.
  * Contact you when necessary, such as to notify you of an expired account or for customer services.
  * Provide additional information about ClickTime's services, partners, promotions, and events, via email, postal mail, or phone.
  * Create invoices for ClickTime usage.



Our computer system uses your email address as your unique login name and to automatically send you your password if you use the "Forgot my Password" function. Your password is hashed and not knowable to anyone other than you, so we cannot and will not share your password information with anyone. When we collect your personal information, that information is for ClickTime's use alone, except:

  * When we have your express permission
  * To our authorized distributors or resellers, who may provide sales and support functions to your geographical area or specific industry
  * To providers of our critical systems infrastructure, as described in our [sub-processors list](https://web.archive.org/policy-timesheet/sub-processors-list/)
  * When law enforcement requires it
  * If you violate our [Terms of Service or our rights and property](https://web.archive.org/policy/terms)



Except as disclosed in this paragraph, **third parties will neither be granted your personal information nor will your information ever be sold**. At our discretion based on your industry or location, we may provide your contact information to an authorized distributor of ClickTime who has contractually agreed to abide by these privacy policies. Otherwise, any information shared with third parties will be shared as aggregate statistics. ClickTime offers you a choice in the way we use provided information. If you would like to change the way that information is received from ClickTime, go to our [Unsubscribe Form](https://web.archive.org/forms/unsubscribe) and enter your email address to opt-out of receiving future emails. ClickTime is an online, hosted application. On certain occasions, ClickTime may need to notify you of important announcements in regards to the operation of our services. These announcements may be sent regardless of your opt-out status, and your only mechanism to avoid these notices is to cease your use of the ClickTime services. 

When an individual customer's administrator enrolls a new user in ClickTime, that administrator may elect to enter certain personal details. This data is considered application data and is not used by ClickTime in any way, other than when ClickTime itself sends important system notices to all users or as described in our [sub-processors list](https://web.archive.org/policy-timesheet/sub-processors-list/). For application data (generally timesheet and expense data) which is entered by end-users themselves, ClickTime considers this data to be proprietary to each customer and ClickTime will not disclose this information except: 

  * When retrieved by members of your own ClickTime account whom you have configured for access (for example, your designated ClickTime account Administrator)
  * When we have the customer’s or end-user’s express permission (for example, if we need the assistance of a third party to assist you with technical support.)
  * When we are compelled to by law enforcement or a court order from any competent jurisdiction where we conduct business
