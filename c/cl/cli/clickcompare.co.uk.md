The Data Protection Act requires us to tell you how we collect and use data about you. You have the right to see the personal data we hold about you and change any incorrect information.

We collect personal information about you from different sources including the details you provide through this website and over the telephone. This information will be needed to provide you with the service you have requested. When dealing with your request we may contact you by post, telephone, email and SMS text.

We may need to disclose your personal information to third parties such as other members of the Tuscarora Group, other brokers, insurance companies and lenders in order to process any policy or loan you require. We may also provide your personal details to regulatory bodies if legally required to do so.

Unless you ask otherwise, we will retain your details and may also send you emails about products and services that we can offer. We will always give you the choice of whether to opt out of these emails.

By agreeing to our Privacy Policy we may, from time to time, release your details to third parties for marketing purposes of products or services that you may be interested in. We will always act to ensure that if you do not wish to receive third party information your details are removed from our database. If you would prefer not to be contacted by third parties please email us at remove@click.co.uk.

If you have applied for life insurance there may be some circumstances where we are unable to provide a quotation in which case we will forward your details to a carefully selected third party with the aim of providing the quotation you have requested

If you have applied for a loan we will use the information you have provided to:

* process the application you have made; make, or cause searches to be made, at a credit reference agency, or agencies - these searches will be shown in any other searches which are made in connection with applications made by yourself and other members of your household. The disclosure of multiple searches may adversely affect your credit profile and may make credit harder for you to obtain; information held about you by a credit reference agency may already be linked to records relating to another person, for example your spouse, and for the purpose of your loan application you will be treated as financially linked. Your loan application will be assessed with reference to all linked records;  
* if you have confirmed you are linked financially with another person, you are declaring that you are entitled to (a) disclose information about that person and/or anyone else referred to by you and (b) that you authorise the broker and any lender involved in the application to search, link and/or record information at credit reference agencies about you and/or anyone else referred to by you.
