## Information Collection

Astro-Vision Futuretech Pvt. Ltd. offers highly personalized content and services that require Birth Data (including Date of Birth, Time of Birth and Place of Birth) of the members. The public (visitors, other members, or anyone not employed by Astro-Vision Futuretech Pvt. Ltd. or the financial institutions used to process membership charges) cannot use the information we gather to identify specific individuals. Further, in order to facilitate commerce, we collect credit card information, member's address, or bank information only from those who choose to benefit from personalized services offered by Astro- Vision Futuretech Pvt. Ltd. Visitors to our site may browse, search and view articles or non-personalized features without entering any personal information.

Any PII (personally identifiable information) that we collect is stored and processed on servers located in the U.S or India. For persons in European Union countries, as used herein, terms such as "personally identifiable information" refer to "personal data" as defined by EU Directive 95/46/EC. By using the Website or its services, you expressly agree that we may transfer your PII outside the European Union in connection with the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. You understand that regardless of jurisdiction, use of PII will continue to be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## Use of Cookies and Server Logs

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record–keeping purposes. We occasionally use cookies on the Website. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Website. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. We set a persistent cookie to store your toolbar or app name and/or user name so you don't have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on the Website. If you reject cookies, you will still be able to use the Website, but your ability to use some areas of the Website may be limited. Some of our business partners may use cookies on the Website. Such cookies may be used to analyze the Website traffic in the Website and monitor operational performance of the Website. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Astro-Vision Futuretech Pvt. Ltd. only and does not cover the use of cookies by any other third party. Server logs capture certain non–Personally Identifying data, such as the time and date of a web visit, the browser and operating system being used, the IP address or domain name of the user's ISP, and the web URL a user linked from. This information is generally used to help us plan system enhancements when necessary and to provide content which is compatible with our visitors' web browsing systems. We do not use server logs in any way that may disclose your PII.

We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our site.

We use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online.

Third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the Internet.

We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to our website. 

You may put astrology as a service, include all these and offer the whole as a package for sale.

## Clear Gifs

The products and services we use to measure and optimize the traffic including visitor feedback and analytic tools, may employ a technology called Clear Gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs). The technology is used to better manage content on the Website by informing us if the content is optimized to meet the needs of the Website visitors. Clear Gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to measure the online movements of Website users in different pages on the Website. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Clear Gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Astro-Vision Futuretech Pvt. Ltd. does not access PII of Website visitors via the Clear Gifs. The Clear Gifs are solely used for the purposes described in this paragraph. 

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. We will send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people only when:   
We have your consent to share the information; We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of us to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.); We respond to court orders or legal process; or We find that your actions on our web sites violate any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services. 

## Use of IP Addresses

An Internet protocol (I.P.) address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your internet service provider or through your company's local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Web servers, the powerful computers that provide web pages for viewing, automatically identify your computer by the IP address assigned to it during your session online. We may collect I.P. addresses for some purposes (for example, to report anonymous user information to our advertisers and to audit the use of our site). We do not ordinarily link a user's I.P. address to a person's personal information, which means we will have a record of each user's session but the user remains anonymous to us. We will use I.P. addresses to identify users of our site when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our site's terms of use or to protect our service, site, or other users. 

## Security

We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our control. Only certain employees have access to the information you provide us. For example, we impose strict rules on our employees who have access either to the databases that store user information or to the servers that host our services. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we try to prevent such unfortunate occurrences. 

## Changes to this Privacy Policy 

We may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages.

If you have questions about this privacy policy or the practices of this site, please [contact us](http://www.clickastro.com/contact-us).
