# Click 2 Houston - Privacy

**Internet Broadcasting Systems Privacy Policy:**  
Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc., KPRC and its affiliates and related companies (collectively "IBS") have created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our commitment to protecting the personal information of our users. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: [www.Click2Houston.com](http://www.click2houston.com/). This privacy policy applies only to information collected by or through this website. It does not apply to information obtained by other means.

**Information Collection and Use**  
This Web site makes use of browser "cookies". Cookies are files written to a user's computer and read by the server programs to inform a Web site if the user has previously visited the Web site. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other purposes. 

We often have third party content and ads on the Web site. These third party partners might use cookies to gather aggregate information about our users' browsing habits. Cookies can be rejected by you and if so none of the above information will be sent in cookies and some of the functionality of the Web site will not work as expected.

We collect information from Web site visitors who must register for certain services online, from users who agree to participate in online surveys, from users who wish to make certain online information requests from us and from users who wish to participate in online contests and promotions sponsored by us. Because participation in these activities is completely voluntary, the user has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The type of information so requested or collected by us includes user contact information (like the user's name and e-mail address) and user demographic information (like gender or age). Contact information will be used to notify contest winners and award prizes and, in some instances may be shared with the contest or survey sponsor. Anonymous survey information will be used for purposes of reporting survey results and monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes unless explicitly stated to the user during the survey or contest. The visitor's contact information will be used to contact the visitor when the visitor has expressed interest in being contacted (visitors can opt-out of receiving future mailings by complying with the choice/output requirements noted below). The user demographic information collected will be used by us to tailor our visitors' experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying content according to their preferences. If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site or to send an e-card through our site, we ask them for the friend's name and e-mail address. IBS will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site or sending an e-card, as the case may be. IBS stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail and tracking the success of our referral program. The friend may contact [security@ibsys.com](mailto:security@ibsys.com) to request the removal of this information from our database. 

We use your IP address and request headers (information your browser sends to the server) to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. We track and record IP addresses that access our site for reporting and profiling purposes only. We also gather anonymous browsing habits of our visitors to better identify content preferences. We also may use cookies to allow third parties to better serve advertisements to you outside of this website on websites operated by Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc. and other websites. We also may use cookies to allow third parties to better serve advertisements to you outside of this Web site on Web sites operated by Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc. and other Web sites. User demographic information is shared with advertisers and other third parties on an aggregate basis, which will not personally identify the individual submitting such information.

We may also share personally identifiable user information with governmental authorities when legally required to do so, and to cooperate with such authorities investigating claims of illegal activity such as (but not limited to) illegal transfer of copyrighted material, or user Web site postings or e-mail messages that contain threats of violence. We may also disclose personally identifiable information in other cases where we have reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use.

**Third Party Advertisers**  
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.

**Linking and Framing**  
This site contains links to other sites. This site is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. Occasionally when linking to another site, you may still see our site's logo or frame. This is to provide you with a seamless experience when visiting our Web site. In these cases you are no longer on Click2Houston.com and are now on a different Web site whose information collection practices may differ from ours. The privacy policy of the site you are on will govern how information collected from you is used.

**Public Forums**  
This site at some or all times makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. IBS cannot accept any responsibility for ensuring the privacy of information that you choose to disclose in these areas.

**Security**  
This site has reasonable security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Please remember that no computer system should be considered safe from intrusion. E-mail may pass through many computer systems, and should not be considered as a secure means of communication unless encrypted. Even then, information is only as secure as the encryption method. Employees are made aware of security policies and changes via e-mail reminders monthly. Access is limited to a very small number of employees with a defined need and is password protected. In order to provide the best possible security we review our Web security policies every 180 days.

**Children and Privacy**  
This site is generally not targeted to children. If we learn that we have received personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will take steps to delete such information or to obtain verifiable parental consent.

**Supplemental Information**  
This site may supplement the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties. This information may be received from our partners in sponsored content sections. The type of information that is shared could include user contact information (like name and e-mail address) and user demographic information (like zip code, age or income level). This site will use such information in accordance with this privacy policy. However, when you leave the Click2Houston.com Web site the privacy statement of the other site will apply to use of information by that site. (See "Linking and Framing" above).
