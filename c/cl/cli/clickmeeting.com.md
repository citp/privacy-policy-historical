We may also ask users to provide additional personal information such as (i) company name, (ii) title, (iii) educational institution and (iv) other company and (v) personal details that the user may opt out of by not entering data when asked.

Accepting the cookies used on our website may give us access to information about the user's browsing behavior, which we may use to personalize their experience and track user traffic patterns, and to merge this info when the user registers. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. The user may browse most of ClickMeeting's website without accepting cookies from ClickMeeting; however, some website functionality may be lost by the user disabling cookies on their computer. Information we collect may be used to enhance the use of our website, and to provide the user with a service that they ordered, arrange the website in the most customer friendly way, communicate special offers and featured items, and/or respond to any questions and suggestions.

## Mailing Policy

When the user sends us an email, we use their email address to thank them for their comment and/or reply to their question, and we will store their communication and our reply for any future correspondence. Beyond our initial reply, we will never use the user's email address to send them any unsolicited message or information, nor will we share it with or sell it to anyone else for such use.

When the user agrees to receive information about our services, promotions and/or new offers, we use their email address and any other information they give us to provide them with the information or other services, until they ask us to stop (using the 'unsubscribe' instructions provided with each email, and/or on the site where they signed up, and/or as we otherwise provide).

When the user requests information or other services from us, we use their email address and any other information they give us to provide them with the information or other services that they requested, until they ask us to stop (using the 'unsubscribe' instructions provided with each email, and/or on the site where they signed up, and/or as we otherwise provide), or until the information or service is no longer available.

We will never use the user's email address or other information to provide them with any unsolicited messages or information (unless that is part of the service they are requesting), nor will we share it with or sell, rent or lease it to any third party for such use.

## The User's Participants' Private Information Policy

Implix recognizes the importance of respecting the privacy of those who decided to entrust their sensitive information with the user. We make every effort to safeguard their security. Implix will never use the information about the participants that users collect within our services to send any information other than expressly provided by their participants, nor will we share it with or sell it to anyone else for such use.

## Information Security

We believe that keeping Personal Information secure is one of our most significant responsibilities.

We restrict access to Personal Information about the user to those employees and others who need to know that information to assist us in our business, or to provide products or services to the user. We safeguard personal information, according to the established security standards and procedures, by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to the personal data information.

When we request users or customers to enter sensitive information, such as their name, geographical address, email address, and a credit card number, it is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry SSL and processed through a reputable payment processor. While on the secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon at the bottom of web browsers, e.g. Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer, becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open, when the user is just 'surfing'.

All of our users' and customers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g. our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are personally granted access to sensitive information.

We do not sell or rent the user's Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes unless they have granted us permission to do so.

We may share the user's Personal Information within other services of Implix for purposes of data processing or storage.

We may also share the user's Personal Information with business partners, service vendors, authorized third-party agents or contractors in order to provide a requested Service or transaction, including processing orders, processing credit card transactions, hosting websites, hosting event and seminar registration and providing customer support. We only provide these third parties with the minimum amount of Personal Information necessary to complete/utilize the requested Service or transaction, and the third parties are not permitted to use the user's Personal Information except for the limited purpose of completing/providing the requested Service or transaction.

We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal processes by disclosing the user's Personal Information and other related information, if necessary. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

We will ask for the user's consent before we use or share their information for any purpose other than the reason they provided or as otherwise provided by this policy. In order for us to know the user's preferences, we will require an action on their part, such as checking the appropriate option, to indicate their consent.

## Security

Implix stores its servers in a highly secure server environment, with surveillance and support to prevent unauthorized access and maintain data security.

We cannot guarantee the security of the user's data while it is being transmitted over the Internet and through servers that are beyond our control. We strive to protect the user's personal information but Implix cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information they transmit to our website or Services. Any data transmissions the user makes over the Internet are done so at their own risk. Once we receive the data transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its security and privacy on our systems.

We need the user's help in keeping the Personal Information they have shared with us accurate and up-to-date.
