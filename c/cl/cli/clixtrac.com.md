# ClixTrac - Privacy Policy

ClixTrac.com (also referred to as "we", "us" and "our"), respects the privacy of every individual who visits our website and/or uses our free banner tracking service. This statement outlines the information we will collect and how we will use that information.

This Privacy Policy will apply to your use of this website and/or our free banner tracking service. This policy statement will also instruct you on what to do if you want us to remove your personal information collected or stored during previous visits to our website.

We will not collect or retain any information about you personally (that is, your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily. If you register for our banner tracking service, become an affiliate or ask for information by mail, we may ask you for personal information, such as, your name, mailing address, e-mail address and phone number.

In the event that you make a purchase from us, we may also ask for your credit card information, as well as, billing information. We will send out confirmation e-mails whenever you make a purchase, to inform you that we received your personal information and/or to confirm your purchase.

If you do provide us with personal information, we may retain and use that information for several purposes.

First, we may store and process the information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our services.

Second, we may use your e-mail address to send you updates about new services, opportunities, specials incentives and other items of interest.

If you have already submitted this information and would like to remove it, you can have your email address removed from future contacts by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/web/20071208025048id_/http%3A//www.clixtrac.com/contact.htm) with your request.

**Sharing of information with third parties**  
In the event that you place an order for some type of goods or service through our credit card processor, your order may be personally processed by that credit card processor. In these cases, all personal information required to process your order will be shared with our credit card processor, using our secure order form. Except as stated above, your personal information (name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or other information) will never be provided to any third party without your prior consent.

**Children**  
Our company does not intend to collect any personal information (such as, name, address, telephone number, age or e-mail address) from persons under eighteen years of age. If a parent or guardian of a child who has provided us with such information would like that information deleted from our records, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20071208025048id_/http%3A//www.clixtrac.com/contact.htm). We will make all reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our records.

**Cookies**  
When you view one of our websites, we may store some information in the form of a "cookie" or similar file that is automatically downloaded to your computer. Cookies enable us, among other things, to track the origin of website traffic that comes from banners and our affiliates. Please be assured that cookies are safe. They are not programs that can be used to damage files, and personal information cannot be gathered from them. If you do not want cookies sent to or stored on your system, most web browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer's hard drive, prevent them from being stored, or trigger a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your web browser's instructions or help screen to learn more about these features.

**Links to other websites**  
We cannot ensure the protection of any personal information that you provide to a third-party website that links to or from our website or uses our tracking service, because those websites are owned and operated independently. Those third-party websites may have their separate Privacy Policy and data collection practices that are beyond our control. Any personal information that you provide to third-party websites will be regulated by their Privacy Policy, if any. We can assume no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the practices, actions or policies of third-party websites, and cannot be responsible for the content or privacy practices of such websites.

**Security precautions**  
We are aware that you may be concerned about the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information, including, in the case of a purchase of goods or services, credit card and billing address information. Therefore, we have taken precautions to ensure that this information is safe and secure. We protect your transactions using a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL, and most are, your sensitive information will automatically be encrypted before being sent over the Internet. You should also know that we do not store your credit card or ordering information on our server.

**Acceptance of these terms**  
By using this website or our banner and link tracking service, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use this website or our services. We reserve the right to change this policy at any time. Your continued use of our website and/or services, following the posting of changes to our Privacy Policy, will signify your acceptance of those changes. Therefore, we recommend you review this Privacy Policy frequently.
