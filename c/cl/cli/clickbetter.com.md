> ## PRIVACY POLICY

Traffic School To Go has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: Traffic School To Go on the Internet. 

If we collect your IP address, we will do so only to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. 

Our site's registration form requires students to give us contact information (like your name and email address) and a unique identifier (your Driver's License number). We use this information only to contact you when necessary and to fill out your Certificate of Completion so that your Court can properly process your paperwork. The security information we collect is for identification purposes during the Traffic School To Go course only. We ask for no information that would have any identifying purpose on any other legal document (such as your mother's maiden name), and we do not sell or share this information with any third parties. 

Our site uses an order form for customers to pay for our services. This form is optional. You may also pay via phone, FAX or regular mail (instructions are on the site). If you choose to give us your credit card number, we will keep it confidential and only transmit it via 128-bit encryption to a secure server, as is standard security on the Web.
