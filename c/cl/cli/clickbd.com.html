<p class="bfont"><b>1. A Special Note About Children.</b></p>
<p class="sfont">Children (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to use the Site
unsupervised and we ask that children do not submit any personal information to
us. If you are under the age of 18, you may only use this Site in conjunction
with and under the supervision of your parents or guardians. </p>
<p class="bfont"><b>2. Information We Collect.</b></p>
<p class="sfont">Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with
a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide
services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our
service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal
information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose. </p>
<p class="sfont">In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or
revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your
personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to use our
services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information,
billing information, shipping information and other personal information as
indicated on the forms throughout the Site. Where possible, we indicate which
fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to
not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature.
</p>
<p class="sfont">Under some circumstances we may require some additional financial
information, such as, but not limited to: if you are registering using an email
account at a free email service, or registering to sell on the Site. We use your
financial information, including credit card information to verify the accuracy
of your name, address, and other information, as well as to bill you for your
use of our services. </p>
<p class="sfont">We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the
Site. We use this information to do internal research on our users'
demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve
you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came
from (whether this URL is on the Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether
this URL is on the Site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP
address. </p>
<p class="sfont">We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Site
to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and
promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive
that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are
only available through the use of a "cookie". We also use cookies to allow you
to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help
us provide information that is targeted to your interests. (Learn more about why
we use cookies). Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are
automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are
always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that
case you may not be able to use certain features on the Site and you may be
required to reenter your password more frequently during a session. </p>
<p class="sfont">Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain
pages of the Site that are placed by third parties. For example, if you view a
web page created by a user, there may be a "cookie" placed within that web page.
We do not control the use of cookies by third parties. </p>
<p class="sfont">If you choose to bid, buy or sell on the Site, we collect information about
your bidding, buying and selling behavior. We also collect other users' comments
about you in our feedback area. </p>
<p class="sfont">If you establish a credit account with us to pay the fees we charge, we
collect some additional information, such as a billing address, a credit card
number and a credit card expiration date and tracking information from checks or
money orders. </p>
<p class="sfont">f you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or
letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your
activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file
specific to you. </p>
<p class="sfont">If you register for ClickBD on another web site or use a web site providing a
service for ClickBD or a web site that helps facilitate your activity on
ClickBD, that
web site may provide personal information about you and your transactions back
to ClickBD. </p>
<p class="bfont"><b>3. Our Use of Your Information.</b></p>
<p class="sfont">We use your personal information to facilitate the services you request. We
use your personal information in the file we maintain about you, and other
information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site to:
resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help promote safe trading; collect fees
owed; measure consumer interest in our products and services, inform you about
online and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize your
experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal
activity; enforce our User Agreement; and as otherwise described to you at the
time of collection. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify
problems or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your personal
information to identify users using multiple User IDs or aliases. We may compare
and review your personal information for errors, omissions and for accuracy. </p>
<p class="sfont">If you choose to list an item for sale on the Site or open a credit account,
or otherwise provide us with your financial information, we use your address and
billing information to bill you and provide associated support. </p>
<p class="sfont">You agree that we may use personal information about you to improve our
marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, improve our content
and product offerings, and customize the Site's content, layout, and services.
These uses improve the Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to
provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using
the Site. </p>
<p class="sfont">You agree that we may use your personal information to contact
you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your
interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices,
product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the Site. By
accepting the User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive
this information. </p>
<p class="bfont"><b>4. Our Disclosure of Your Information.</b></p>
<p class="sfont">As a matter of policy, we <span class="sfont">do not</span> sell or rent
any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes
without your explicit consent. However, the following describes some of the ways
that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business
to provide our services. </p>
<p class="sfont"><span class="sfont">Advertisers.</span> We aggregate (gather
up data across all user accounts) personal information and disclose such
information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other
third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these
situations, we do not&nbsp; disclose to these entities any information that
could be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as your
name, password,
credit card number, and bank account number, are not disclosed to these third
parties in a personally identifiable manner without your explicit consent. </p>
<p class="sfont"><span class="sfont">ClickBD Community.</span> Your User ID is displayed
throughout the Site and is therefore available to the public. All of your
activities on the Site will be identifiable to your User ID. Other people can
see your bids, items that you have purchased in the past, your feedback rating
and associated comments, your postings on the Site, and so on. Therefore, if you
associate your name with your User ID, the people you have revealed your name to
will be able to personally identify your ClickBD activities. Although our pages are
coded with robot exclusion fonts, others may illegally attempt to
automatically collect your email address from the Site. We describe how to
change your email and User ID below in Section 8. We also provide a number of
ways to allow other users to find out more about you and your site activities,
such as our feature that allows users to quickly see all of the items you are
offering at the time. If you are involved in a transaction, we have features
that allow other users to view your email address and obtain your contact and
shipping information to help complete the transaction. Further, we may send out
notices to you or other community members regarding suspicious activity or
policy violations on the Site. </p>
<p class="sfont"><span class="sfont">External Service Providers.</span> There
are a number of separate services offered by third parties that we refer to as
external service providers that may be complimentary to your use of the Site
(e.g. listing agents, escrow, authentication, mediation, shipping, packaging).
If you choose to use these separate services, disclose information to the
external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information
about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy
policy. We do not disclose your personal information to external service
providers unless you provide your explicit consent. With your consent we may
provide some of your personal information to the external service provider
offering such services, for your convenience. To prevent our disclosure of your
personal information to an external service provider, you can decline such
consent or simply not use their services. Because we do not control the privacy
practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before
deciding to use their services.</p>
<p class="sfont"><span class="sfont">Internal Service Providers for our Operations.</span>
We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to
facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and service
operations that we provide to you (e.g., search technology, discussion boards,
bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs, co-branded credit cards) and
therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these
internal service providers. These internal service providers' are subject to
confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit
their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to
facilitate the specific outsourced ClickBD related operation, unless you have
explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In
some instances, the internal service provider may collect information directly
from you (such as for ClickBD surveys or for a co-branded credit card). In these
cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider,
and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will
be strictly up to you. If you provide additional information to an internal
service provider directly, then their use of your personal information is
governed by their applicable privacy policy. </p>
<p class="sfont"><span class="sfont">Other Corporate Entities.</span> We share much of
our data, including personal information about you, with our subsidiaries and
joint ventures that are committed to serving your online trading needs and
related services, throughout the world. To the extent that these entities have
access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they
treat information they obtain from their other users. Our subsidiaries and joint
ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our
practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law.
ClickBD, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures, or any combination of such, will
share some or all of your personal information with another business entity
should we plan to, merge with, or be acquired by that business entity. Should
such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow
this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal
information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice
in as provided in Section 12 ("Notice"). </p>
<p class="sfont"><span class="sfont">Legal Requests.</span> ClickBD cooperates with law
enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as:
intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you and
the ClickBD community from bad actors. Therefore, in response to a verified request
by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal
investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to)
disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, UserID
history, fraud complaints, and bidding and listing history without a subpoena.
Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability
to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your
personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a
subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we
believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to:
prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal
activity. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, address, city,
postal code, country, phone number, email, and company name
to other participants under confidentiality agreement, as we in our
sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an
investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other
unlawful activity. </p>
<p class="sfont">Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your
private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in
ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without
limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information to
the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may
unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users
may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site.
Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy,
we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or
private communications will always remain private. </p>
<p class="bfont"><b>5. Your Use of Other Users' Information.</b></p>
<p class="sfont">In order to facilitate interaction among all ClickBD community members, our Site
allows you limited access other users' contact and shipping information. As a
seller you have access to the User ID, email address and other contact and
shipping information of the buyer or winning bidder(s), and as a buyer or
winning bidder you have access to the User ID, email address and other contact
information of the seller. </p>
<p class="sfont">By entering into our User Agreement, you agree that, with respect to other
users' personal information that you obtain through the Site or through an
ClickBD-related communication or ClickBD-facilitated transaction, ClickBD hereby grants
to you a license to use such information only for: (a) ClickBD-related
communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages, (b) using services
offered through ClickBD (e.g. escrow, insurance, shipping and fraud complaints),
and (c) any other purpose that a user expressly agrees to after you tell them
the purpose you would like to use it for. In all cases, you must give users an
opportunity to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what
information you have collected about them. In addition, under no circumstances,
except as defined in this Section, can you disclose personal information about
another user to any third party without our consent and the consent of that
user. You agree that other users may use your personal information to
communicate with you in accordance with this Section. Note that law enforcement
personnel, and other rights holders are given
different rights with respect to information they access. </p>
<p class="sfont">ClickBD and our users do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the
foregoing, you are not licensed to add an ClickBD user, even a user who has
purchased an item from you, to your mail list (email or physical mail) without
their express consent. To report ClickBD related spam to ClickBD, please email
us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@ClickBD.com">privacy@ClickBD.com</a>. </p>
<p class="bfont"><b>6. Use of Email Tools.</b></p>
<p class="sfont">You may not use the Email This Item to a Friend service or other email
services that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate
our User Agreement. We do not permanently store email messages or the email
addresses sent from these tools. </p>
<p class="bfont"><b>7. Control of Your Password.</b></p>
<p class="sfont">You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password,
including fees charged to your account. Therefore we do not recommend that you
disclose your ClickBD password to any third parties. If you choose to share your
User ID and password or your personal information with third parties, you are
responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should
review that third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password,
you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be
subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your
password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your
password as detailed in Section 8. </p>
<p class="bfont"><b>8. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal
Information.</b></p>
<p class="sfont">We offer you the ability to automatically review and change the information
you submit to us by logging into the Site and entering in the new information
yourself. Generally, we will not modify your personal information based on your
request because it is very difficult to authenticate your account manually. You
can change your user Id, email address, contact information, financial
information, shipping information and user preferences by going the preferences
and setup section in
<a onclick="return openNonHelpLink(this.href);" href="/user/interactive/home.php">My ClickBD</a>. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or
is inaccurate. Once posted, you may not be able to change or remove any public
postings made on the Site including our chat rooms or other message areas or the
feedback area. </p>
<p class="sfont">Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information,
billing information, shipping information, and financial information from our
active databases. To make this request, email <a href="mailto:privacy@ClickBD.com">
privacy@ClickBD.com</a>. Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably
possible based on your account activity and in accordance with our deactivation
policy and applicable law. </p>
<p class="sfont">We will retain in our files some personal information you have requested to
remove to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot
problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our User Agreement and comply
with legal requirements as is permitted by law. Therefore, you should not expect
that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our
databases in response to your requests. However, such personal information will
be deactivated from public and member viewing and will only be available to
select ClickBD personal. </p>
<p class="bfont"><b>9. Other Information Collectors.</b></p>
<p class="sfont">Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document
only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the
extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are
bidders, buyers or sellers on our site or other sites throughout the Internet,
different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you
disclose to them. Since ClickBD does not control the privacy policies of third
parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party. We
encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to
others. </p>
<p class="bfont"><b>10. Security.</b></p>
<p class="sfont">Your information is stored on ClickBD's servers located in the United
States, and Bangladesh. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal
information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure
to protect your privacy, including encryption, "firewalls" and Secure Socket
Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and
unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect
such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company.
However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. </p>
<p class="bfont"><b>11. Privacy Tools.</b></p>
<p class="sfont">It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. We have
created easy-to-read summaries, privacy principles, a privacy chart and, are
working on privacy enhancing technology to help summarize our full privacy
policy. If you have questions about any part of this summary or if you would
like more detailed information, we encourage you to review our full privacy
policy. </p>
<p class="bfont"><b>12. Notice.</b></p>
<p class="sfont">We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the
amend terms on the Site. All amended terms shall automatically be effective 30
days after they are initially posted on the Site.</p>
