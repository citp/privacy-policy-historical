## Glossary

**Ad Server:** An ad server, in its simplest form, is responsible for delivering an ad to be shown in a web page. Today, communications may be sent to several servers in the process of selecting and delivering an ad. This occurs in a matter of milliseconds.   
**Beacons and Tags:** Beacons and tags enable online advertising companies to collect data and serve advertising on web sites by allowing communication between a web browser and an ad server. A beacon (or web beacon) is a small transparent image that is placed on a web page. A tag is a small piece of computer code that is run by the web browser.   
**Cookie:** A cookie is a small text file that is stored in a web browser by a website or ad server. By saving information in a cookie, websites and servers can remember preferences or recognize browsers from one visit to another or from one website to another. (See the Privacy Statement below for information on how ClickCertain uses cookies.)   
**Interest-Based Advertising:** Interest-based advertising uses information collected across multiple web sites to predict users' preferences and to show ads that are most likely to be of interest to those users.For example, if a user visits a travel site, they might see travel related ads on another site. ClickCertain offers web users choices with respect to the use of the ClickCertain Platform for this type of advertising.   
**PII:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that by itself can be used to identify a specific individual. PII includes such things as name, address, phone number, and email address. ClickCertain prohibits its customers from providing PII for use on the ClickCertain Platform. (See the Privacy Statement below for more information.)   
**Non-PII:** Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that cannot by itself be used to identify an individual person. Non-PII includes such things as browser type, operating system, the web address of a web page visited, the time and date a web page was visited, and the web address of the referring page. It may also include the number of times a particular browser has been shown a particular ad, or it may include generic categories indicating inferences that have been made about users' interests.   
**Real-Time Bidding:** Advertising buyers are able to bid in “real time" for the opportunity to show an online advertisement when a web page is loaded by a web browser. The winning bidder gets to show their ad in the web page. Of course, the explanations above are simplified. There are many resources available on the web to learn more about these concepts and online advertising in general. Although we have no responsibility for the content of these sites, we offer the following as good places to start learning:
