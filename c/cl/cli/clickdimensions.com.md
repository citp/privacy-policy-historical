  * If you fill out a web form on our site, your information will be stored in our CRM system and some amount of your past browsing on our site may be available to us to determine your interests.  We may use this information to more effectively engage with you and improve our site.  However, if you use private browsing as described below, you may provide us your information without making your past browsing activity available to us. If you do not wish for us to have your personal information, please do not fill out any of the web forms on this site.
  * If you provide your email address and consent for email marketing, some information is collected about when/if the email was opened and what links were clicked.  This information is used to assess the engagement and success of an email campaign.
  * Clicking on a link in any of these emails may cause you to be personally identified on our site and may cause some part of your past browsing history on our site to be available to our personnel so we may more effectively engage with you and improve our site.  If you do not wish for this tracking to occur, you can unsubscribe from our mailings or use private browsing mode to avoid tracking.
  * ClickDimensions never uses visitor identification techniques that involve sharing information you provide us with other sites or vice versa.  ClickDimensions never stores any information in your computer’s Flash local shared objects area (i.e., we never use what is known as ‘flash cookies’).
