**Privacy Policy**

Effective Date: 7/31/2007

**INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE**

ClickReport is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. DoogleOnDuty collects information from our users when they register for this service.

**REGISTRATION**

In order to register for DoogleOnDuty service, a user must first complete a short registration form. During this process a user is required to give personal details such as their full name, phone number, email, credit card, and address details. This information is used to validate the authenticity of the user registering for the service. Credit Card Numbers are collected from our users to charge them for our services.

We use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. This company does not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.

This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we at ClickReport are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our website and to read the privacy statement of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

This website also contains a link to a Live Chat function that is hosted by one of our service providers. Because this is hosted on a Third Party’s web site, the information that is collected here, such as you email address, name, and phone number, is governed by the service provider’s web site and not by DoogleOnDuty.

**COOKIES**

For example, if you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer please follow the directions on the following web site: <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283185>

We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. See “Third Party Advertisers.”

Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices, every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customer's information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked security door. All other users account information is protected by a password authentication process. Our servers have the latest industry standard firewall protection and are constantly monitored 24 hours a day.

ClickReport uses SSL Encryption to protect the sensitive information our users submit to our website, such as their credit card numbers.
