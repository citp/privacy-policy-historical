For details on when and how we will inform you about any updates, as well as information on your choices when we make updates, please carefully review the section below called Changes To Our Privacy Policy.

Under the section below entitled “Your Choices,” you can learn about how you may disable or alter our usage cookies.

We may share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

These centers are protected by physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable federal and state regulations. Additionally, Clinkle uses firewalls and data encryption. We also enforce tight restrictions on physical access to our office and files and limit digital access to sensitive data in order to ensure that only those employees who require the access to fulfill their job responsibilities actually have it.

Frequently Asked Questions

Who Can See My Personal Information?

6.1

Clinkle keeps secure and private all of your personal information except your first name, any content you upload, such as profile pictures, text, and picture messages, birthdate, and details on where you have shopped, including the amount, location, time, and other party involved in your transactions, but not the actual goods or services you purchased. By default, we only share your last name with your friends and friends of your friends. 

Why Does Clinkle Share My Information? 

6.2

We primarily share your information so that you can find your friends, and they can find you. As our products and services change over time, sharing data between users will lead to an increase in value on the platform. As an example, we will help connect you with trusted Clinkle Merchants if they are making an offer or providing a deal that we think will appeal to you based on your preferences and previous transactions. 

What Can I Do To Protect My Information? 

6.3

Although Clinkle works very hard to keep all of its users’ information secure, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. By enabling the screen lock on your phone and changing your passcode, PIN, and/or pattern frequently, you can reduce the risk of someone gaining access to your information. Similarly, keeping a strong email password and updating it from time to time will help prevent someone from gaining access to your account. Finally, we may, from time to time, provide links or portals to other websites or applications. Always be aware when you are leaving the Clinkle Services and entering another website or application, and be sure to review the relevant privacy policies of the other websites or applications.
