<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Third Party Links:</b></p>

<p>The Site may contain links to third-party websites ("Third Party Websites"). Please be aware that Click4Riches™ is not responsible for the privacy practices of Third Party Websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Site and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects PII. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Security:</b></p>

<p>All collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure environment. We take precautions to protect PII both online and off-line. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your PII, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>

<p>Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. All of our users' information, not just PII, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to PII. Furthermore, access to this information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all user information. Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. Please note that any attempt to breach the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware or software supporting the Site or other websites under the control of Click4Riches™ constitutes a crime punishable by law. We will turn over to authorities, any and all evidence relating to a potential breach of security or other abuse against the network, servers, databases or other such supporting equipment or software. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your PII. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minors:</b></p>

<p>We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate and monitor the interactive activities of their children.

<p>Please be advised that, after you delete your PII, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems. In addition, this deletion will not change or delete PII which may have already been shared with third parties, all as provided above in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will need to contact the third parties that contact you directly to change your preferences regarding their use of your PII.</p>
