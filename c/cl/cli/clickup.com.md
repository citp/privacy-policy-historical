# ClickUp | Privacy Policy

_Effective as of: May 25, 2018_

Your privacy is extremely important to us. To better protect you, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

This Privacy Policy relates to information collected by Mango Technologies, Inc. DBA ClickUp (referred to in this Privacy Policy as "ClickUp" "we" or "us" or "our") through your use of our website and our Services, features, and information available on our website (which are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as the "ClickUp Service").

Scope of this Privacy Policy

Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not govern all the information ClickUp may process. Our commitment to customers and service providers is governed by a separate [Data Protection Addendum.](https://clickup.com/dpa) This Privacy Policy is also incorporated into and governed by our [Terms of Use.](https://clickup.com/terms)

Our commitments to employees are governed by our internal employment policies.

In all instances we are committed to transparency with our customers, employees, and to protecting your data privacy.

What Information do we Collect?

You will be required to establish an account in order to take advantage of certain features of the ClickUp Service. If you wish to establish an account you will be required to provide us with information (including personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information). In addition, we may obtain your personally identifiable information from you if you identify yourself to us by sending us an e-mail with questions or comments.

Depending on your use of the ClickUp Service, we collect two types of information:   
_personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information._

**Personally Identifiable Information**  
Personally identifiable information identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you. Examples of personally identifiable information include your name, IP address, company name, job title, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and billing and credit card information.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**  
Non-personally identifiable information is information, any single item of which, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you, including demographic information (such as age, profession, company industry, gender, current location, or zip code), IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and statistical data involving the use of the ClickUp Service. Certain non-personally identifiable information may be considered a part of your personally identifiable information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered non-personally identifiable information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-personally identifiable information (for example, your account preferences).

Why do we Need your Personal Data?

We will only process your personal data in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws. We need certain personal data in order to provide you with access to ClickUp. If you registered with us, you will have been asked to check a tick box indicating your agreement to provide this data in order to access our services. This consent provides us with the legal basis we require under applicable law to process your data. You maintain the right to withdraw such consent at any time. If you do not agree to our use of your personal data in line with this policy, please do not use our platform.

**Information we collect automatically when you use the Services:**  
We collect information about you when you use our Services, including browsing our websites and taking certain actions within the Services. 

  * Your use of the Services: We keep track of certain information about you when you visit and interact with any of our Services. This information includes the features you use; the tasks, projects, teams and other links you click on; the type, size and filenames of attachments you upload to the Services; frequently used search terms; and how you interact with others on the Services. We also collect information about the teams and people you work with and how you interact with them, like who you collaborate and communicate with most frequently. 
  * Device and Connection Information: We collect information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other devices you use to access the Services. This device information includes your connection type and settings when you install, access, update, or use our Services. We also collect information through your device about your operating system, browser type, IP address, URLs of referring/exit pages, device identifiers, and crash data. We use your IP address and/or country preference in order to approximate your location to provide you with a better Service experience. How much of this information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services.
  * Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: ClickUp and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g., web beacons, device identifiers and pixels) to provide functionality and to recognize you across different Services and devices. For more information, please see our [Cookies and Tracking policy](https://clickup.com/cookies), which includes information on how to control or opt out of these cookies and tracking technologies.
  * Log files: We collect non-personally identifiable information through our Internet log files, which record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of the ClickUp Service. This information may be used to analyze trends, to administer the ClickUp Service, to monitor the use of the ClickUp Service, and to gather general demographic information. We may link this information to personally identifiable information for these and other purposes, such as personalizing your experience on the ClickUp Service, and evaluating the ClickUp Service in general.



**Information we receive from other sources**  
We receive information about you from other Service users, from third party services, and from our business and channel partners. 

  * Other users of the Services: Other users of our Services may provide information about you when they submit content through the Services. For example, you may be mentioned by someone else on a task, or a team member may upload content about you to ClickUp. We also receive your email address from other Service users when they provide it in order to invite you to the Services. Similarly, an administrator may provide your contact information when they designate you as another administrator for a task, team or an Enterprise or Unlimited Account.
  * Other services you link to your account: We receive information about you when you or your administrator enable third-party apps or integrate or link a third-party service with our Services. For example, you or your administrator may also integrate our Services with other services you use, such as to allow you to access, store, share and edit certain content from a third-party through our Services. For example, you may authorize our Services to access and display files from a third-party document-sharing service within the Services interface.. The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.
  * Other partners: We receive information about you and your activities on and off the Services from third-party partners, such as advertising and market research partners who provide us with information about your interest in, and engagement with, our Services and online advertisements.

We may disclose personally identifiable information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service, to detect fraud, or to protect the safety and/or security of our users, the ClickUp Service or the general public. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
