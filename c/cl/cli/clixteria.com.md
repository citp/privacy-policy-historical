** WELCOME !! ******   
Clixteria.com is a website where you get paid to click, read, signup, and do surveys online. Our site IS VERY DIFFERENT from those sites that pay you a crummy one tenth of a cent per action. We pay you top cash directly into your PayPal account for the work you do on Clixteria. We offer serious cash for those who want to work from home doing simple tasks on a computer! 

Your Clixteria membership is TOTALLY FREE! We'll povide you with your own private administration area where you can view your earnings and transfer your money directly into your PayPal account. You keep all your earnings! No fees or other BS ever!
