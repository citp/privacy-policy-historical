##  Company Practices 

The following statement describes the overall company practices of ClickPapa Ad Network, including advertising on our network of websites, and products and services that are offered by ClickPapa Ad Network. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ClickPapa Ad Network does not own or control, or to people that ClickPapa Ad Network does not employ. 

##  Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data 

ClickPapa Ad Network delivers advertisements across multiple channels and media, including to web surfers who visit any of the hundreds of websites that are a part of ClickPapa Ad Network's network. With respect to individuals who visit those sites, we, and/or one or more of our third party advertising technology vendors, may collect what is known as "Click Stream Data." Click Stream Data is anonymous, and includes information such as a web surfer's IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a web surfer, date and time, domain type, and responses by a web surfer to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor. We, and/or a third party advertising technology vendor, may use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and web beacons (1x1 pixels). 

##  How Collected Information is Used 

The non-personally identifiable data that ClickPapa Ad Network and/or its third party advertising technology vendors collect are used for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements to people across the different websites they visit. ClickPapa Ad Network may also use the non-personally identifiable data to better target content to individuals in an effort to create a personally relevant experience for each person. The data are also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different individuals. If a consumer elects to provide ClickPapa Ad Network with personally identifiable data, we may utilize such data for marketing purposes. In addition, that data may be combined with information collected from other sources to assist with targeting ads to that consumer's preferences and behaviors, and for other ClickPapa Ad Network sales and marketing efforts. 

##  Personally Identifiable Consumer Data 

ClickPapa Ad Network uses ad serving technology from Cox Digital Services. Personal information is collected from ClickPapa Ad Network publishers to establish a business account. Publishers should refer to the Cox Digital Services Privacy Policy for more information. 

##  Sharing With Third Parties 

All personally identifiable data provided by individuals is maintained in confidence by ClickPapa Ad Network. There are instances, however, in which personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, as described below. The non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners of ClickPapa Ad Network on an anonymous basis. In addition to the above, there is also the possibility that ClickPapa Ad Network, or part(s) of the company, may one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company. If that's the case, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to your information. Finally, ClickPapa Ad Network may share information on individuals as it deems necessary to comply with a court order or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials. 

##  Third-Party Advertising Technology Vendors 

ClickPapa Ad Network also works with various third party advertising technology vendors. Although the majority of the online advertisements on ClickPapa Ad Network sites are displayed by ClickPapa Ad Network, we also allow third-party ad serving companies, including other ad networks, to display advertisements on our sites. These vendors may also use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect Click Stream Data. These companies may offer you a way to opt-out of ad targeting based on their cookies, and some of them are also members of the Network Advertising Initiative. You may find more information by clicking on the company names above and following the links to the Web sites of each company. 

##  Security Precautions 

ClickPapa Ad Network and it’s advertising technology partners make significant efforts to maintain the security of its network and the data we collect. We use various technologies, including, in certain instances, encryption, to ensure the high security standards. Any data that is stored on ClickPapa Ad Network's servers is treated as confidential and is not generally available to the public. ClickPapa Ad Network has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such information for the purpose of performing their jobs. Please keep in mind, however, that the Internet is not a 100% secure medium. Therefore, although we use reasonable efforts to protect information, the possibility of somebody defeating our security measures does exist. 

##  Consumer Choice

These tools are used to collect non-personally identifiable data to provide better and more relevant services and messages to that user. We believe that the use of such tools assists in providing a more meaningful web-surfing experience, but you may opt-out of the use of ClickPapa Ad Network cookies and those of our third party advertising technology vendors if you would like.
