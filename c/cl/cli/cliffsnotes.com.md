None. Wiley does not require users to provide any personal information when browsing this Web site. They may read our articles and study guides and browse our Literature Note content without inputting any personal information.

Yes, we may use cookies in a variety of ways, such as to collect information to help us learn things like what kinds of customers our site attracts, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Cookies are small bits of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are when you return.

## What information does Wiley collect when users subscribe to CliffsTips, this Web site's free e-mail newsletter service? How can users unsubscribe to CliffsTips?

Users over 13 years of age may voluntarily sign up for CliffsTips, this Web site's free e-mail newsletter service, by providing their own name and e-mail address. Any user who subscribes to our CliffsTips will always be given a clear opportunity to unsubscribe. An "unsubscribe" link will appear in every CliffsTip e-mail that they receive. If users who under age 13 choose to sign up for CliffsTips, they must provide their name, e-mail address, and the e-mail address of a parent or guardian. That parent or guardian will be notified that the under-13 user has signed up for CliffsTips and also will have the option of unsubscribing their child.

## If a user signs up for CliffsTips, will their e-mail information be shared with any third parties?

Only with the user's permission. Wiley occasionally informs CliffsTips subscribers of interesting specials, products, and services we believe users will appreciate; these opportunities may be provided by our own companies or third parties. We will only send you such notices if you indicate your interest in the checkbox on our CliffsTips subscription page.

## What information is collected when a user submits an answer to a CliffsNotes.com poll question?

Our CliffsNotes.com poll is a voluntary feature that is provided to entertain and inform our users. Poll responses will not be saved or identified with the individual users who posted them. Only the overall results and percentages that are tallied by our poll engine may be analyzed internally or occasionally shared with third parties.

## What information is collected when a user submits a question to "Ask Cliff"?

"Ask Cliff" is a voluntary feature that allows our site visitors to send in questions about studying, taking tests, and getting through school.

The user's name and e-mail information is not shared with anyone except for the Wiley editorial team who reviews and answers select questions. Not all submitted questions will be answered. Some questions and answers will be posted to our "Ask Cliff" page or used as testimonials (such as in advertisements or catalogs), but these postings never identify the person who submitted the question — either by name or e-mail address. Wiley can make use of "Ask Cliff" questions and any other material submitted, including without limitation in promotional materials. Although users under 13 may submit questions to "Ask Cliff," their questions as written will never be posted publicly on the "Ask Cliff" page.
