Your posts and comments are stored on our server, together with the date and timestamps. They are publicly shown in the section where you posted these on our platform, along with your username and timestamp. They may also be indexed by search engines.  
Private messages are shown in a similar fashion, but can only be seen by you, the recipient and our staff.

The specific information provided by linked networks is determined by these third parties and may vary by network. In all cases, the linked network should show you a page asking you for the permissions to share the requested data with us. It should describe the information that is being shared with us. 

### Payment providers

When providing a payment to our website, you are taken to a third party payment provider (Verotel / Paypal / etc). The payment is done on the third party website. Upon completion, this third party website will inform us that the payment is completed, along with a minimum amount of personal data to verify the payment. The specific information provided to us by the payment provider may vary. However for your protection, we do not store your address or payment data on our servers. If necessary to resolve a dispute, we can request this information from the payment provider.
