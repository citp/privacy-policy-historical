# Clinton Foundation — Privacy Policy

#### Effective: 07/09/09

The William J. Clinton Foundation Privacy Policy (“Policy”) was created to help you understand how the Foundation uses information that is automatically collected from your computer and information you submit to this website. The Foundation is committed to protecting your online privacy. By using this Site, as defined by our Terms of Use, you agree to be legally bound by this Policy, as it may be amended from time to time. If you do not agree to this Policy or cannot form a legally binding contract, you are not permitted to use this Site.

Generally, if we collect information from you, we use it only for the purposes for which it was collected and the other limited purposes set forth below.

### Information Collected

This Site collects two types of information from you: (1) General Information; and (2) Personal Information.

  * The domain name from which you linked to our Site

We may use the information from these forms, transactions, and applications for the purpose for which it was collected. We also work with certain third parties and, in some cases, personal information will be shared with these third parties in order to pursue the Foundation’s mission and goals.

We will not sell or disclose any of your personal information to a third party, except for the sharing information with our business partners (as noted above) and in the following limited circumstances:

  * With your permission to disclose the information
  * To change hosts or when our host transfers business assets (as further described below)
  * To share it with agents or contractors who perform services for us
  * As required by law

##### Corrections/Updates

This Site gives users the opportunity to change any information previously provided to us through this Site. To do so, please send us an e-mail through our Contact Page.

##### Transfer of Business Assets

At any time, this Site’s host may be acquired, merge with another business, or acquire or buy other businesses or assets. In such transactions, both General and Personal Information will likely be among the transferred assets.

##### Cookies

The Site may use “cookies,” a small string of text stored by a web browser on the user’s computer, to determine whether you have visited our Site previously. Cookies also allow the Foundation to measure activity on the Site and to improve your user experience, by, for example, remembering your passwords and viewing preferences and allowing you to visit any member-only parts of the Site without re-registering. Cookies cannot retrieve any other data from a hard drive or obtain an e-mail address. Although a user has the ability to modify most browsers to either accept all cookies, notify the user when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies, it may not be possible to use certain services on this Site if cookies are not accepted.

##### Links

This Site contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of or the contents on any other websites. We encourage you to review the privacy policy and any other online policies of other websites that you link to, visit, and/or use.

##### Children

The Site does not seek to collect any information from children. If a child provides us with information, the parent or guardian may notify us, and the information will be deleted from our records.

##### Security

While there is no such thing as “perfect” security on the Internet, we take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of your personal information. This Site has security measures in place to protect loss, misuse, and/or alteration of such information under our control. However, we do not guarantee the security of your General or Personal Information. In addition, we do not assume any liability for third party use of your General or Personal Information, whether obtained legally or illegally from or through this Site.
