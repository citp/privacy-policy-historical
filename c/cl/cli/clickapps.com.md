Company Privacy Policy

Clickapps (a division of Chillingo Ltd) is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users while providing the highest possible quality of service. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998). 

**Information collected**

We collect the information you supply to us through enquiry and registration forms, and every time you e-mail us. If you are a registered user (i.e. if you have a ClickPayGo account) we also collect information about where and when you log on, how long you remain connected to the shop. 

We also collect information automatically about your visit to our website. The information obtained in this way, which includes IP addresses and browsing patterns, is used in aggregate form to audit usage of the website and cannot be used to identify you. 

**Use of personal information**

We process the information we collect about you for the purposes of providing the best possible service and providing you with information about products and services that we offer. If you are a registered user we also process your personal information so that we can charge you the right amount for accessing the service and to provide you with online information about your account. 

If you complete one of our registration forms you will be asked if you wish to receive occasional emails containing special offers and other information about our service. If you do not wish to receive such emails, please ensure that you leave the relevant box on the form un-ticked (the box is ticked by default). We will not share your email address with third parties and we will not pass on any other information apart from your email address. You can change your preferences on receiving information from us and third parties at any time by writing to us at "Chillingo Ltd, Beechfield House, Winterton Way, Macclesfield, SK11 0LP, United Kingdom" or by sending an email to support@clickapps.com. 

**How do we protect your data?**

When you make purchases with us, we use a secure server. Any data you give us is encrypted using a 'Secure Socket Layer' (SSL) session. SSL is an industry standard and is one of the best ways to ensure Internet messages are not intercepted. You should be aware, however, that older browsers cannot use SSL. To be sure, you will need Netscape browser version 4.05 or above, or Microsoft Internet Explorer browser version 4 or above.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, though you can usually change your browser to issue a warning message before accepting a cookie or to reject all cookies. We do not store your password or any other information in the cookie, or use it for any other purpose apart from tracking patterns of behaviour of visitors to our website. Our cookies do not contain any personal identifying information about you, your location, your preferences or you use of our services. 

**Third party sites**

Third party websites that are linked to our website or which you can access through our service are not covered by our Privacy Policy, so we advise you to be careful when you enter any personal information online. We accept no responsibility or liability for these sites. 

**Disclosure of information**

We are registered under the data protection laws in the United Kingdom and we take all reasonable care to prevent unauthorised access to your personal data. Our staff and those working for our agents or contractors have a responsibility to keep your information confidential. We will not pass your information on to any third parties unless you have agreed that we can 

**Right of access to your information**

If you want to know exactly what personal information we hold about you, you can obtain it. If it transpires that the information held is inaccurate, we will make the necessary amendments and confirm to you that these have been made.
