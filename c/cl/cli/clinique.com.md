>>> 
>>> In conjunction with obtaining information through cookies, our web servers may log details such as your operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone in which your device is located.  The web server logs also may record information such as the address of the web page that linked you to our site and the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet.
>>> 
>>> To control which web servers collect this information, we may place tags on our web pages called “web beacons.”  These are computer instructions that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies.

>>> 
>>> Third Party Web Analytics Services
>>> 
>>> We may use third party web analytics services on this site, our social media platforms, or our social networking or mobile applications, such as those of Adobe Site Catalyst, Coremetrics and/or Google Analytics. The service providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web server logs and web beacons to help us analyze how visitors use the site. The information collected through these means (including IP address) is disclosed to these service providers, who use the information to evaluate use of the website. You may deactivate the ability of these analytics services to analyze your browsing activities on this site. To exercise your choice with respect to their collection of information on this site:

>> How We Use the Information Collected by Automated Means

>> We may use the information collected through automated means like cookies on this site for market research, data analytics and system administration purposes, such as to determine whether you’ve visited us before or are new to the site, and for compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures, including compliance with relevant industry standards and the enforcement of our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/customer-care/general-info/terms-conditions).  In addition, we may use this information to deliver a more personalized experience to you while you are on our site.   We also may use the information in other ways for which specific notice is provided at the time of collection.

>> California Do Not Track Notice
>> 
>> Under California law, website and online service operators are required to disclose how they respond to web browser “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about a consumer’s online activities over time and across third party websites, to the extent the operator engages in that collection.  At this time, we do not track our customers’ personal information over time and across third-party websites and therefore this requirement does not apply to us.  
>> 
>> California law also requires website and online service operators to disclose whether third parties may collect personal information about their users’ online activities over time and across different sites when the users use the operator’s website or service.  Third parties that have content or services on our site such as a social feature, analytics service, or an advertising network partner, may obtain information about your browsing or usage habits but this information does not include personal information.   We do not knowingly permit such third parties to collect any personal information from our site unless you directly provide it to us and we provide it to them with your consent.
