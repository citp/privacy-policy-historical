**Website Privacy Policy**

The last update to our Privacy Policy was posted on October 17, 2013. This Privacy governs the privacy policy of our Website, [www.Readingtree.org](http://www.readingtree.org/)

**Definitions**

“Non-Personal Information” (NPI) is information that is in no way personally identifiable and that is obtained automatically when you access our Website with a web browser.  
“Personally Identifiable Information” (PII) is non-public information that is personally identifiable to you and obtained for us to provide you with a product or service. PII may include information such as your name, address, phone number, and other related information that you provide to us.

**Our Commitment to Your Privacy**

Our Privacy Policy tells you what PII we may collect from you, how we may share your PII, and how you can limit our sharing of your PII.

Readingtree.org and its affiliated entities are committed to the security and privacy of all our customers. We take your privacy seriously, and we will work with you to ensure that you have an enjoyable online experience.

Readingtree.org, its affiliated entities and our affiliates respect your privacy and recognize the need for appropriate protection and management of your PII you share with us.

As a part of our commitment, we have adopted the guidelines used by the Direct Marketing Association Privacy Promise to American consumers. Other than as necessary to provide you with goods and services, we agree to (1) provide our customers with notice of their ability to opt out of information exchanges with our affiliates; (2) honor our customers’ requests not to have their information transferred to our affiliates; and (3) honor our customers’ requests not to receive solicitations from our affiliates.

**Links to Other Websites**

Our Website may contain links to other websites. You understand that these websites are not under our control and are not subject to our Privacy Policy.

**Information We Collect**

We may analyze NPI for trends and statistics as to how people use our Website. Unless you wish to acquire goods or services through our Website, we typically will not require you to provide PII.

We receive and store PII that you provide to us when you place an order, register with us, send an email or call us, enter a contest, subscribe to a service, request to receive a catalog or brochure, or participate in a promotion. In addition to your PII, we may also collect PII that you submit to us about other people, such as the name and address of someone you are referring to us. Ultimately, you have the choice in deciding whether or not to provide PII to us.

**How Information is Used**

We use PII that you provide for our internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking your order, subscription or registration; analyzing statistics and demographics; and informing you of new products, services, and offers as provided by us and/or our affiliates.

Our affiliates may have products, services, or offers about which you may be interested in receiving information and they may use the PII we have for you to contact you. If you don’t want to receive information from our affiliates, you can let us know so you’re no longer contacted by our affiliates about their products, services, or offers.

We may also combine information you give us online or through printed forms; publicly available information; and information we receive from other parties. We use this combined information for your online experience and to let you know about new products, services, offers, and other promotion.

To give you the best possible service, we may use our affiliates to provide contracted services for our business, including, but not limited to processing credit cards, hosting our website, shipping products to you, or advertising. In many cases, we will need to provide some if not all the PII you provide to use so our affiliates can perform these services. Our affiliates are only authorized to use your PII as provided within this Privacy Policy.

There are times that we may have to disclose your PII to comply with state and federal laws; to assist law enforcement and governmental agencies in preventing or investigating fraud or other crimes, or in response to a court order. In such instances, we will only provide the PII requested and your PII will only be used for legal purposes as opposed to marketing.

Finally, if we sold or transferred our business, we would transfer your PII to the purchaser as appropriate and might also retain a copy of your PII for any new business ventures we would start.
