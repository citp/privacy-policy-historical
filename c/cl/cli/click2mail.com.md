The following Privacy Policy sets forth Click2Mail's commitment to the protection of our customers' information. 

Click2Mail complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Click2Mail has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (the "Principles") of Notice; Choice; Accountability for Onward Transfer; Security; Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation; Access; and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

This Privacy Policy covers Click2Mail and applies to all customer information that Click2Mail obtains when a customer registers for or uses a Click2Mail online service, including visiting a Click2Mail owned and controlled web site (a "Click2Mail Web Site"). Top Level Domains (TLDs) covered by this Privacy Policy are: Click2Mail.com and Click2EDDM.com. 

From time to time Click2Mail may offer special promotions, contests or other unique marketing efforts which would be governed by their own specific terms and conditions.

Customer Information 

Online privacy concerns focus on the use and protection of customer information which a customer reasonably expects to be kept private. "Customer information" is information which can be associated with a specific individual or entity, including, for example, a customer's name, address, telephone number, email address, financial information and information about online activities that are directly linked to the Customer. As is common practice, we collect customer information, such as name, address, telephone number, credit card information and a variety of other information in the course of providing products and services to a customer and billing a customer. 

Information collected and stored automatically 

During the course of your use of the Click2Mail Web Site and internet services, we automatically track and store certain information about your visit. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. We use this information in the normal operation of the Click2Mail Web Site and we may disclose or use this information but only on an aggregated basis.
