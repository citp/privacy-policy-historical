# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy sets out our practices with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in connection with www.ClickIndia.com (the Site). This Privacy Policy may be updated by us at any time by posting on the site without any prior notice. Also, this Privacy Statement may be supplemented or modified by agreements entered into between us and an individual from time to time. In this Privacy Statement, personal information means any information about an identifiable individual, including contact and demographic details, not including collective information or information regarding a group in summarized form.  


Collection of Personal Information  
The Site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as name and email address) and demographic information (such as postal code, age, or income level) and other information that is used by us to provide services. We use the customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information that he or she has requested regarding the Site or regarding services offered by us. This Site uses an ad form for customers to place online and/or print ads. One of the express purposes of the Site is to gather contact information provided voluntarily by customers to be published either online or in print, as the case may be, and in connection with items that are for sale by customers. We have no control over who views online or print ads. Contact information provided may be used to contact customers when necessary. We collect customers financial information (such as account or credit card numbers) to bill the user for products and services, but retain this information only as required to process the transaction and for as long as may be required by law.

Demographic and profile data is also collected at the Site. We use this data to tailor each visitor's experience at the Site, showing the user content that we think he or she might be interested in, and displaying the content according to the users preferences.  
Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (such as email addresses) and demographic information (such as postal code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send users information about our products and services. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the Opt-Out section below).  
We may use customer information for additional purposes that may be identified at or before the time that the information is collected. We also use information from customers for accounting and transaction completion purposes.

We use third-party advertising companies like google to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
