#####  (b) Cookies for the expansion of our reach

So that we can distribute our content in the internet we utilise cookies with your consent in order to display the content of our website on other websites or in social networks.

###### Google Adsense

clipmyhorse.tv uses the online advertising service, Google AdSense. Advertising is intended through its use to be presented to you which is designed for your interests. These advertisements can be recognised by the information “Google Ads” in each of the advertisements.

Due to your visit to our website Google receives the information that you have called up our website. For this, Google places a cookie on your computer. The data listed under item 3.2.1 of this data protection declaration are transmitted. Additionally, so-called web beacons are utilised; these are invisible graphic images with whose use your user behaviour on our website can be evaluated. The IP address communicated by your browser as part of Google AdSense will not be combined with other Google data. We neither have any influence on the data collected nor is the full extent of the data collection known to us. These data are transmitted to the USA and analysed there. It is possible that these data are passed on to contractual partners of Google and to authorities. This website has also activated Google AdSense advertisements of third-party providers. The above-mentioned data may be transmitted to these third-party providers (the list may be found under [https://developers.google.com/third-party-ads/adx-vendors?visit_id=0-636589427183379249-3187330481&rd=1](https://developers.google.com/third-party-ads/adx-vendors?visit_id=0-636589427183379249-3187330481&rd=1)). 

You can prevent the installation of the Google AdSense cookies in various ways  
a) through an appropriate setting in your browser software, in particular the suppression of third-party cookies leads to you receiving no advertisements from third-party providers;  
b) by deactivating the Google interest-related advertisements via the link <http://www.google.com/ads/preferences>, whereby this setting is deleted if you delete your cookies;  
c) by deactivating the providers’ interest-related advertisement which are part of the self-regulating campaign “About Ads“, via the link <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>, whereby this setting is deleted if you delete your cookies;  
d) through a permanent deactivation in your browsers, Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome, under the link <https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996?hl=en>;  
e) by not giving us the required consent for the use of Google Adsense. However, we would like to point out that this may result in you being unable to fully utilise all of our website's functions.

Further information on the purpose and extent of the data collection and its processing and further information on your rights and setting options in this context for the protection of your private sphere may be obtained from: Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountainview, California 94043, USA; data protection conditions for advertising: <https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en> and information on the DoubleClick cookies: <http://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2839090>. 

###### Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking

We use the online advertising program “Google AdWords” and, as part of Google AdWords, Conversion Tracking. Google Conversion Tracking is an analysis service of Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; “Google”). If you click on an advertisement placed by Google, a cookie for Conversion Tracking will be placed onto your computer. These cookies are valid for 30 days, contain no personal data and are thus not used for personal identification.

If you visit certain pages of our website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we can detect that you have clicked on the advertisement and have been forwarded to this page. Every Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. There is thus no possibility that cookies can be tracked back via the websites of AdWords customers.

The information which is obtained with the aid of the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have decided on Conversion Tracking. From this, customers discover the total number of users who have clicked on their advertisement and who have been forwarded to a page which is marked with a Conversion Tracking tag. However, they receive no information with which users can be personally identified.

We use Google AdWords solely with your consent. You can revoke a consent which you have granted by

  * proceeding as described above;
  * Download and install the browser plug-in to be found under the following link: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en> or

Please note that you must activate the opt-out cookie in each of the browsers used by you on all your end devices and must also reactivate it where necessary if you delete all cookies in a browser. More detailed information and the data protection declaration from Google can be found under: <https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en>



###### Google Tag Manager and Google Publisher Tags

We use the Google Tag Manager from Google on our website. The Google Tag Manager is a solution with which the marketer can manage website tags via a user interface.

The Google Tag Manager service ensures the triggering of other tags which in turn may collect data under certain circumstances. Google Tag Manager does not access these data. If a deactivation has been undertaken at domain or cookie level, it remains in existence for all tracking tags which are implemented using Google Tag Manager, more detail on this may be found under: <https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en>. 

###### Facebook Pixel and links to social media pages

The behaviour of users can be backtracked using Facebook Pixel after they have been forwarded to the website of a provider by clicking on a Facebook advertisement.

The collected data are anonymous for us and therefore provide us with no indication of the personal identities of the users. However, the data of Facebook are stored and processed so that a connection to the relevant user profile is possible and Facebook is able to use the data for its own advertising purposes in accordance with the Facebook data usage guidelines ( <https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/>). They can enable Facebook and its partners to place advertisements within and outside Facebook. Additionally, a cookie may be stored on your computer for these purposes.
