**PARENTS: Please Note Our Privacy Policy Regarding Children**

Given the ever increasing exchange of information and materials in today’s internet world, we are extremely sensitive to privacy issues especially when it comes to children. Therefore, we are especially careful in any communications involving children and their families. We do not knowingly collect any information whatsoever from children 13 and under. We do not verify the age of any registrant and simply rely on the veracity of any registrant when such registrant provides us with information. Consequently, if you are uncomfortable with this lack of verification procedures, we urge you to not register with us or on any of our sites. We treat any child over the age of 13, as disclosed to us in the registration process, the same way as we treat all other registrants. 

We urge parents to regularly monitor and supervise their children's on-line activities.
