# PRIVACY POLICY – CLOUT MAGAZINE

**STATEMENT**  
Since your privacy is of the utmost importance to us, we have provided this Statement about privacy and information usage by CloutOnline.com. Any information gathered by CloutOnline.com will be kept strictly confidential and will only be used or shared in ways for which you have specifically consented. CloutOnline.com will not sell, rent or trade your personal information to any third party. We will take special care to protect the privacy and security of your information. By visiting CloutOnline.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Statement.

**YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS PROTECTED** All personal information and transaction details you provide on CloutOnline.com’s Online Store, from your e-mail address to credit card number, is protected by 128 bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. All payments (credit, debit, bank transfers, e-checks) are processed through PayPal, so we never see your credit card information or bank account number. When shopping online, on CloutOnline.com or elsewhere, we’d like to offer you these tips on shopping securely: Check if the web address on the page that asks for your personal information and credit card information begins with “https:” instead of “http:”. You can tell a web site uses security software if your browser displays the icon of a locked padlock at the bottom of the screen (Netscape Navigator™; – versions 4.0 and higher); if you see the icon of an unbroken key at the bottom of the screen (earlier versions of Netscape Navigator™); or if you see the icon of a lock on the status bar (Microsoft Internet Explorer®).

PayPal does not share your credit card information or phone number with us. From time to time we may send you announcements regarding CloutOnline.com’s updates, new arrivals and special offers through e-mail to the e-mail addresses that we have collected from PayPal. If you would not like to receive such announcements, please e-mail info@cloutonline.com.

Contact CloutOnline.com with a question or suggestion in which we collect your name, e-mail address and any comments you have.
