	<h1 class="page_header">Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.</p>
	<h1>1. What information do we collect?</h1>
	<p>We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>(a) information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website (including your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of page views);</li>
		<li>(b) information relating to any transactions carried out between you and us on or in relation to this website, including information relating to any purchases you make of our goods or services;</li>

	<h1>2. Cookies</h1>
	<p>A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.</p>
	<p>We may use both "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies on the website. We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the website. We will use the persistent cookies to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit.</p>
	<p>Our payment services providers may also send you cookies.</p>
	<p>Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking "Tools", "Internet Options", "Privacy", and selecting "Block all cookies" using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.</p>

		<li>(e) send statements and invoices to you, and collect payments from you;</li>
		<li>(f) send you general (non-marketing) commercial communications;</li>
		<li>(g) send you email notifications which you have specifically requested;</li>
		<li>(h) send to you our newsletter and other marketing communications (relating to our business or the businesses of carefully-selected third parties which we think may be of interest to you or, where you have specifically agreed to this, by email or similar technology (you can inform us at any time if you no longer require marketing communications);<br><strong>provide third parties with statistical information about our users - but this information will not be used to identify any individual user;</strong></li>
		<li>(j) deal with enquiries and complaints made by or about you relating to the website;</li>

	<h1>4. Other disclosures</h1>
	<p>In addition to the disclosures reasonably necessary for the purposes identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may disclose information about you:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>(a) to the extent that we are required to do so by law;</li>
		<li>(b) in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings;</li>
		<li>(c) in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk);</li>
		<li>(d) to any of our agents, suppliers or subcontractors (but only as reasonably necessary for our purposes as set out above);</li>
		<li>(e) to the purchaser (or prospective purchaser) of any business or asset which we are (or are contemplating) selling.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>5. International data transfers</h1>
	<p>Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate in order to enable us to use the information in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

	<p>You expressly agree to such transfers of personal information.</p>

	<p>We will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.</p>
	<p>We will store all the personal information you provide on our secure (password- and firewall- protected) servers.</p>
	<p>Of course, data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.</p>
