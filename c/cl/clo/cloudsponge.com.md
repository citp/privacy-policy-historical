  1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT 

    1. _Generally_. We collect personal information from our users in order to provide you with a personalized, useful and efficient experience. The categories of information we collect can include:

      1. _Information you provide_. You can browse our site without providing personal information, but you must register in order to access most of the features of the Service. We ask for certain information such as your company name, your name, email address, and password when you create an account on the Service, or if you correspond with us. We may also collect payment information in connection with a transaction on the Service. If you decide to try the Service by uploading your team members’ contact information to your account through the Service, we may request your log-in credentials for the third-party service from which you would like us to access the information in your web-based or desktop address book.

      2. _User Content and Messages_. After you setup your account, you may choose to provide additional information such as the names and email addresses of additional members of your team or an additional phone number. You may also test the Service by uploading your team members’ name and email address to your account from your address book using the Service. At times, you may choose to send us messages. We may retain any messages you send to us.

      3. _Information about others_. Upon creating an account on the Service, you may use the Service to request that your users grant you access to their various contact lists and make these contact lists available to you through the Service in order for you to invite their friends and contacts to connect with your information system. We support the OAuth standard and will use the OAuth standard to facilitate your users’ upload of their data from their respective contact management provider whenever possible. **Use of the Service with respect to third-party contact management providers that support the OAuth standard does not require Cloud Copy to have access to, and Cloud Copy will not in fact have access to, your users’ passwords in such instances**. We may request your users’ log-in credentials in order to complete the upload of their address book information from any source that does not support the OAuth standard.

We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages and permit you to make requests of your users through the Service. We may also send you Service-related emails or messages (e.g., account verification, order confirmations, change or updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). For more information about your communication preferences, see "Your Choices Regarding Your Information" below.

    2. _Use of cookies and other technology to collect information_. We automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our website or use our Service.

      1. _Cookies and Similar Technologies_. When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click, how frequently you access the Service, and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us to track your usage of the Service over time. We may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.

      2. _User Agent Data_. We may collect user agent information from your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. User agent information may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, information about your mobile device, referring / exit pages and URLs, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. When you access our Service by or through a mobile device, we may receive or collect and store a unique identification numbers associated with your device ("Device ID"), mobile carrier, device type and manufacturer, phone number, and, depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device.

      3. _Links_. We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Service, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Service and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on, even if it was only clicked on once.

      4. _Third Parties_. We may receive reports from third party analytics providers, which we may combine with the personal data we collect from you directly to provide and improve the Service.. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit, your use of third party applications, and other information that assists us in analyzing and improving the Service. We also use advanced analytics service providers, such as Inspectlet and CrazyEgg to analyze how you interact and engage with our Service. The collection and storage of your data by these service providers is governed by their respective privacy policies, which can be accessed here: [Inspectlet Privacy Policy](https://www.inspelect.com/legal#privacy) and [Crazy Egg Privacy Policy](https://www.crazyegg.com/privacy). You can opt out of the collection and storage of your data by either of these companies at any time by using the links below:

[Opt Out Inspectlet](https://www.inspeclet.com/optout)

We use or may use the data collected through cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including advertising; (c) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our website and our Service; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (f) otherwise to plan for and enhance our Service.

Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Cloud Copy or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Cloud Copy or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.
