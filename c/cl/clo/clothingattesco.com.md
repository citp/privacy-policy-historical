The data controller (who determines the purpose and manner in which your personal data is used) is Tesco Stores Limited (referred to in this policy as “we” or “us”).

We are committed to doing the right thing when it comes to how we collect, use and protect your personal data. That’s why we’ve developed this privacy and cookies policy (“Policy”), which:

They have their own privacy policies that explain how they use your personal data.

Our Websites or Mobile Apps may contain links to other websites operated by other organisations that have their own privacy policies.

This section explains how and why we share personal data with other companies within the Tesco Group.

Where we have mentioned above our use of your personal data is based on our “legitimate interests”, these are:

      * to service our customers’ needs, including delivering our products and services;
      * to promote and market our products and services;

      * to understand our customers including their patterns, behaviours as well as their likes and dislikes;
      * to protect and support our business, colleagues, customers and shareholders;
      * to prevent and detect anti-social behaviour, fraud and other crime;
      * to test and develop new products and services as well as improve existing ones.

We may share the personal data we collect with other companies in the Tesco Group. For example, we share personal data with the following Tesco Group companies.

    * ### 

    

Tesco Bank use your Clubcard data to help them work out whether they can offer you certain products, and what discounts, deals or offers they can make you.

Tesco Bank may use data that you provide, such as your name and address, to find any Clubcard(s) that are linked to your address. They may use data about these Clubcard(s) to help tailor offers to you. When they do this, they will only ever use the Clubcard linked to your address which gives you the best terms, deals or offers.

Tesco Bank may look at your Clubcard data in different ways to help understand more about you (we call this ‘profiling’). Profiling includes things such as how likely Tesco Bank think you are to pay back money they lend you, how often you use other Tesco products and services, and how you prefer to shop. Profiling helps Tesco Bank create a number of ‘Clubcard scores’, which they then use as one of the factors in their automated decision-making process.

Where applicable, at the point of applying, individual offers you receive may be affected by your credit rating. Tesco Bank may also take into account whether or not you are a Clubcard customer.

Profiling allows Tesco Bank to tailor offers specifically to its customers. This means that different Clubcard customers may get different offers. For its banking products profiling means that customers will receive better offers and/or be more likely to be accepted for the product requested than non-Clubcard customers who have a broadly equivalent credit rating.

Where Tesco Bank are offering insurance products, Clubcard profiling means that although different Clubcard customers may get different offers, Clubcard customers will always receive better offers than non Clubcard customers.

We make Clubcard information (including information about purchases when you use your Clubcard) and information about your online behaviour we have collected through cookies available to Tesco Bank. This helps them to improve their service and make their marketing communications more relevant to you.

We may also use data provided to us by Tesco Bank, for example information about the Tesco Bank products you hold, to improve our service and make our marketing communications more relevant to you.

You can find more information about the way in which Tesco Bank use your data in their [privacy and cookies policy](http://www.tescobank.com/help/privacy-and-cookies/).

#### Tesco Mobile

    

We make Clubcard information (including information about purchases when you use your Clubcard) and information about your online behaviour we have collected through cookies available to Tesco Mobile.

    * This section explains how and why we share personal data with Retail Partners and Service Providers.

When we share personal data with these companies, we require them to keep it safe, and they must not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes.

    * ### 

    

We work with a number of Retail Partners who:

      * sell products through our services; or 
      * offer products, services and/or the ability to earn points through Clubcard.

We only share personal data that enable our Retail Partners to provide their services.

    * ### 

    

We work with carefully selected Service Providers that carry out certain functions on our behalf. These include, for example, companies that help us with technology services, storing, combining and analysing data, processing payments, provide us with legal or other professional services as well as delivering orders. We only share personal data that enable our Service Providers to provide their services.

Some of the Service Providers we work with operate online media channels1, and they place relevant online advertising for our products and services, as well as those of our suppliers and our Retail Partners, on those online media channels on our behalf. For example, you may see an advert for our products and services as you use a particular social media site or watch television through your pay TV account.

When we introduce a customer to a product or service this is referred to as onboarding. We use partners to help us ‘onboard’ you as a customer to any marketing you receive from us.

Examples of our Service Providers include Facebook, Adobe, dunnhumby, Liveramp and WorldPay.

  * ## 

    

This section explains how and why we share personal data with other organisations. 

We may share personal data with other organisations in the following circumstances: 

    * if the law or a public authority says we must share the personal data or for the administration of justice;
    * if we need to share personal data in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (this includes providing personal data to others for the purposes of preventing fraud); 
    * where we restructure, sell or transfer our business (or a part of it). For example, in connection with a takeover or merger.
  * ## 

    

We know how important it is to protect and manage your personal data. This section sets out some of the measures we have in place.

    * We apply physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personal data;
    * We protect the security of your information while it is being transmitted by encrypting it;
    * We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption to keep this data safe;
    * We only authorise access to employees and trusted partners who need it to carry out their responsibilities;
    * We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we carry out penetration testing to identify ways to further strengthen security;
    * We will ask for proof of identity before we share your personal data with you; and
    * We will reveal only the last four digits of your payment card number when confirming an order.

Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard your personal data, it is important that you keep your login details and devices protected from unauthorised access.

The personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by companies operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers. If we do this we ensure that your privacy rights are respected in line with this Policy. The most common way we do this is to put in place a specific type of contract, a copy of this type of contract can be found [here](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm) or through an approved scheme such as the [Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome).

  * ##
