### The Information We Collect And Store

We also use “cookies”. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and authenticaion information for future logins to the Service. We also use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service.
