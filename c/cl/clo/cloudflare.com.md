## CloudFlare privacy & security policy

CloudFlare will not sell, rent, or give away any of your personal information without your consent. It is our overriding privacy principle that any personal information you provide to us is just that: private. We do not presume that you are granting us permission to share your personal information with third parties wanting to sell you products or services that you have not requested. In order for us to provide some of the services we do we may on occasion need to provide information you supply us to external parties. When this is necessary we will provide you explicit notice and the ability to opt-out. CloudFlare may need to purge information from its system from time to time, and does not promise to keep any information beyond what is required by applicable law or regulation.

### INFORMATION DESIGNATED AS PUBLIC

As part of our service you may decide to provide information specifically to be shared with third parties. For example, you may allow us to build statistical reports based on what malicious visitors have visited your site. In cases such at these, we will try to make it clear whenever any information you provide us will be made public. Even when you give us permission to make certain information public, we will still protect the information designated private (such as your name, email address, and other information specifically tagged to your identity) from being disclosed. 

### INFORMATION COLLECTION

CloudFlare is the sole owner of the information collected on this site and through any CloudFlare service. As visitors browse our web site, or your sites if they are protected by CloudFlare, we sometimes track them and their interactions in order to provide a better service (e.g., using visitor log data in order to detect new threats).

### CORRECTIONS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION

This web site makes it easy to correct any mistakes in your personal information at any time. Whenever possible, we will give you an opportunity to review and change any information you provide to us. If you notice a mistake in the information you provide us, you can always revise it. This can be done either online or contacting us directly.

### COOKIES

Our site uses "cookies" in order to provide a better service to our users. Cookies are placed by your browser on your computer's hard drive to assign a unique identification for your computer. CloudFlare never stores information we consider personal or private in a cookie. This eliminates the chance of other sites reading our cookies and learning your personal or private information. Instead, we use cookies to help direct you to the appropriate part of our web site. For example, a cookie may indicate that you are a repeat visitor to our site. We will then use that information to present you with more informative pages customized to your preferences. Our goal is to use cookies in order to provide a personally customized and easy-to-use service.

If you do not want CloudFlare or other websites to use cookies, you can disable them within your browser. Some portions of the CloudFlare website are still functional without cookies. You may delete CloudFlare's cookies through your browser's cookie manager. Be aware that this will reset your session, disable auto-login, and may adversely affect other functions on the CloudFlare website.

As part of our service, CloudFlare may place cookies on the browsers of your visitors to your CloudFlare-protected sites. We do this to in order to track malicious visitors and reduce the chance of blocking legitimate users.

### DATA AGGREGATION

CloudFlare may aggregate data we acquire about you and the visitors to your site. For example, we may assemble data to determine how spiders crawl the Internet and whether they are engaged in malicious activity. If we assemble this sort of data and provide it to external parties, your personal information (such as your name, email address, and other information specifically tagged to your identity) will never be attached to or included in the aggregated data. Please note, public data you provide us, such as log files of your site's visitors, may be included in the aggregate data, reports and statistics.

### PROMOTIONAL PARTNERS

From time to time, CloudFlare may notify you about an offer from one of our promotional partners (e.g., Apps Marketplace partners) via our website or email. While we may target particular types of users for these offers, we will do all of the targeting within our system. Our business partners will not have any access to the targeting information, including the names of the people who may be interested in a particular product or service. Until you affirmatively respond to a promotional offer, we will not reveal any identifying information about you to any of these partners. Note that these partners may have their own Privacy Policies and may not be covered by CloudFlare's policy.

### THIRD PARTY WEBSITES

The CloudFlare website and the other websites contain links to the sites of third parties. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites. We encourage users to be aware when they leave our website, and to read the privacy statements of other websites. We cannot guarantee that these third parties abide by the privacy principles outlined here.

### LAW ENFORCEMENT

It is possible that CloudFlare may be required by court order to provide information about our customers. CloudFlare may also be required to provide information pursuant to law, applicable regulation, subpoena or other legal process. If we are ever required to provide information under these circumstances, we will, whenever possible, attempt to inform users whose information we are compelled to reveal.

### NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES

We will always maintain the overriding principle that we will not sell, rent, or give away any personal information you share with us without your consent. We do not believe we will need to change that principle going forward. However, if we do need to change any other aspect of the policy, we will post changes on the website.
