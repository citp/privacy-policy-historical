# Privacy Policy | CloudMagic

##### Introduction

This Policy describes what information we collect when you use our service and how we use this information collected. We are not in the business of loaning, renting or selling information to others. We only use the information collected to better the service offered to you. 

##### Your privacy is important to us

CloudMagic, Inc. is committed to protect your privacy. Through the CloudMagic website and mobile applications, we collect two types of user information: General Statistical Information and Personal Identifying Information. 

##### Collection, use and disclosure of General Statistical Information

When you visit our website and use our applications we gather usage statistics. This information is referred to throughout this Policy as "General Statistical Information". We use and store this data only on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us to determine how and the extent to which certain parts of our website and applications are used. The stored General Statistical Information does not contain any Personal Identifying Information about you or any of our other users. 

##### Collection and use of Personal Identifying Information

In addition to collecting General Statistical Information, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information. Information that can reasonably be used to identify you is referred to in this Policy as "Personal Identifying Information". The following describes each aspect of Personal Identifying Information: 

  1. Account info

The first email address you add to CloudMagic app becomes the username for your CloudMagic account. If you were to use CloudMagic app in a different mobile device, you can log in using CloudMagic account and all your email accounts will be available instantly. We might also use that email address to reach out to you periodically. 
  

  2. Account authentication/passwords and data

Accounts are added to CloudMagic through OAuth authentication (where possible). OAuth is a secure mechanism which gives us access to your data without letting us know your password.

Where OAuth is not supported, we keep your account username and password in an encrypted form safely in our servers. 

We then use the authorization provided by you to build an index of your data, as well as to continuously keep your index updated. This index is stored securely in our servers. We use AWS servers to store your data. [Here is an overview of AWS’ security policies](http://aws.amazon.com/security/). Apart from that we take a number of security measures to ensure that your data is never read by anyone else.

Your data is used only to deliver emails to your CloudMagic app on your device. We also ensure that all transmission is secure using HTTPS so that no one else can access your data. 

  

  3. Our policy towards children

CloudMagic does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personally identifiable information such as email address or name from children under the age of 13, we will promptly delete it. Parents and guardians can contact us on [hello@cloudmagic.com](mailto:hello@cloudmagic.com) if they are aware that their child has provided us with personal information without their consent. 
  

  4. Support queries

The support queries you write to us about might contain personal information. We use this information solely to help you resolve the issues reported and improve the product quality. 



##### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is sent from a web server to your browser and stored on your computer. We use persistent session cookies which ensure that you don't have to log in each time you visit. CloudMagic never stores your information that we consider personal or private in a cookie. In addition to our own cookies, we make use of third-party services like Google Analytics to track usage and volume statistics to help us analyse how the service is used. Because CloudMagic is entirely personalized, your browser must accept cookies for us to provide our services to you.

##### Deletion of account authentication/passwords and data

In the event you delete your data from CloudMagic, or revoke access to your data, or delete your CloudMagic account, your entire index as well as your authentication/password information is completely and permanently deleted from our servers, and we therefore do not have access to any of your data anymore.

##### Disclosure of Personal Identifying Information

We will only disclose your Personal Identifying Information to third parties if we are required to do so by law, or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with legal processes such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order. 

We never loan, rent or sell your Personal Identifying Information to others. 

If CloudMagic should have its assets sold to or merged with another entity, user information collected through the service may be among the items sold or transferred. The user will have the rights to delete his/her data.

##### Third-party websites

The CloudMagic website may contain links to third-party websites over which we have no control or responsibility regarding content, privacy policies, or practices. We suggest that you review the Privacy Policy applicable to any third party site that you visit. This Privacy Policy applies only to our own website at [https://cloudmagic.com](https://web.archive.org/).

##### Financial information

We use Stripe, a secure third party payment processor to process all the credit card transactions. This means that your credit card information never reaches CloudMagic servers/employees, and is sent directly from your web browser to Stripe over a secure SSL connection. Stripe has the most stringent level of PCI compliance in the industry. [Here's more on how Stripe handles security](https://stripe.com/help/security). We also use Apple iTunes and Google Play Store to collect payments directly within apps. Their respective security policies can be found [here](http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html) and [here](http://support.google.com/googleplay/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=2450225&parent=1100168&ctx=topic). 

##### Changes to the CloudMagic Privacy Policy

CloudMagic may amend this Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on our website. All amended terms will be automatically effective without further notice, 30 days after they are first posted. If you have any comments on this Privacy Policy please email us at [hello@cloudmagic.com](mailto:hello@cloudmagic.com) or write to us at:
