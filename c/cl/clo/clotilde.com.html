These policies do not apply to the collection and use of consumer information by DRG offline. By using our Web sites, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Pledge. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our Web sites.</p>
<p><b>Anonymous Information Collected By DRG<br>
</b>When you visit a DRG <a href="http://drgnetwork.com/pages/privacy_websites.html" target="_blank">Web site</a>, DRG will capture certain anonymous information from our visitors. This includes the Internet provider's name (e.g. AOL), paths taken through a given site, and "click stream" activity such as when you click on a banner advertisement. No information that could identify you as an individual is collected in this manner.</p>
<p>Cookies are used as part of our statistical reporting and have no personal information tied to them. We use this technology to enhance your experience on our sites such as to help ensure that you are exposed to offers and products that are of interest to you.&nbsp;We do not capture e-mail addresses or personal information through our use of cookies.</p>
<p>Information that is collected through the use of cookies and standard Web server log files may be used to enhance the content of our Web sites to provide you with a better experience in the future, to respond to customer inquiries and suggestions, or to provide special offers to you.</p>
<p>DRG may also share this non-identifiable information with third parties from time to time.</p>
<p><b>Personal Information Collected By DRG</b><br>
From time to time while on a DRG <a href="http://www.drgnetwork.com/pages/privacy_websites.html" target="_new">Web site</a>, we may ask you to provide personal information such as your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. We may ask you to provide personal information when making a purchase, setting up an account, or joining one of our online programs. DRG will use your personal information for the purpose for which it was provided and as otherwise set forth herein. DRG may combine your personal information with information collected by its  <a href="http://www.drgnetwork.com/pages/privacy_companies.html" target="_new">subsidiaries</a> or share it among its   <a href="http://www.drgnetwork.com/pages/privacy_companies.html" target="_new">subsidiaries</a>. DRG may also supplement the information we collect with information from other sources to tailor our <a href="http://www.drgnetwork.com/pages/privacy_websites.html" target="_new">Web sites</a>, products and offerings to your needs.</p>
<p><b>Your E-mail Address<br>
</b>If you have provided your e-mail address to DRG, from time to time you will receive e-mails from us that we feel would be of interest to you. With every commercial e-mail, we will provide you with a link to opt-out from receiving future commercial e-mail. You can also opt-out of receiving future e-mail messages from us by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:Privacy@DRGnetwork.com">Privacy@DRGnetwork.com</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that if you elect not to receive commercial e-mail messages from us, we will continue to send you transactional related e-mail, such as product recall information, or safety or security information, subscription information, membership details, account status, order confirmations, shipping confirmations, invoices and customer service related e-mail.</p>
<p>DRG will not share your e-mail address with any third party except as expressly set forth in this policy.</p>
<p><b>E-mail handling procedures</b><br>We will provide an opt-out link on all of our commercial e-mail announcements. Opt-out requests are usually handled as soon as the request is made. However, it may take up to ten days to process an opt-out request.</p>
<p>Because we want to ensure that those people who have opted out no longer receive commercial e-mail from us, we may share our opt-out e-mail addresses with our trusted third-party advertising partners who engage in e-mail marketing to their customers on our behalf. As such, we may share the e-mail addresses of persons who have opted out with these third parties for the sole purpose of scrubbing their e-mail marketing lists with our opt-out list to remove the e-mail addresses of those persons who have opted to no longer receive our commercial e-mail announcements.</p>
