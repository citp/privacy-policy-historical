## Purposes in Automatic Data Collection and Processing

The data we collect is processed for the purposes indicated in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms). Beyond the personal information your are giving us to register for an account, CloudWork will gather some generic information automatically. This information may include the IP address or cookie information assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors to the Site, the URL that you just came from and where you next go to, and your computer browser information. This data may help us determine better customer service and Site needs. CloudWork may use this data with third parties in aggregate form, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. We may provide aggregate information, not information about you personally, to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Site and Service. We may store a 24 hours log of your data for troubleshooting reasons. If an error occurs the log may be stored for longer period of time to help us troubleshoot user issues.

## External Links

This Privacy Policy applies to the CloudWork Site and Service only. We do not exercise control over any sites that you may visit from a link on our Site. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.

## User Consent

By sending your personal data, you declare to have read and accepted the terms of this Policy. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, you expressly and unequivocally consent to:

  * the collection and processing of your professional contact details by CloudWork in accordance with the indicated purposes established by CloudWork and this Policy;
  * the processing of your data outside the European Economic Area by third party data processors (e.g. for the purpose of providing professional services to us such as hosting or database management services); and
  * the reception of commercial e-mails from CloudWork, in accordance with the applicable laws on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce.
  * the communication of the data to other site Users outside the European Economic Area at the request of the User.



Your consent to personal data collection and processing may be revoked in accordance to Sections 6 and 11 of Spanish Data Protection Basic Law 15/1999.

## Data Disclosure

CloudWork warrants that it treats your personal data with strict confidentiality in accordance with applicable law. However there are some situations in which CloudWork shall disclose any personally identifiable and/or non personally identifiable information about you or your use of our Site and Service, in compliance with a legal obligation or in order to correctly deliver its services or perform other obligations in accordance to the applicable regulations and rules set forth in the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms) of the Site and Service.

In relation to international disclosures, Users expressly accept that we may disclose or internationally transfer your data to other Users and third parties that are located outside the European Union. This international disclosure or transfer will only be performed for the sole purposes stated under these Terms and Conditions.

We may use third party service providers to facilitate or outsource some aspects of our business and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these service providers. These service providers are subject to legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced related operation. We may share our data, including personal information about you with our partners and joint ventures in furtherance of our business. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users. Our partners and joint ventures should follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law. In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if CloudWork, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that CloudWork goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that may be transferred to or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of CloudWork may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Data Security

We have implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures set forth to preserve your personal information protected from unauthorized use or access and from being altered, lost or misused, taking into account the technological state of art, the features of the information stored and the risks to which information is exposed, in accordance with Royal Decree 1720/2007 implementing the Spanish Data Protection Law 15/1999.

We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to protect the security of your personal information during transmission, which encrypts all of the information you input. All personal information collected from other services that you provide through the use of the Service is stored securely. Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (i.e. customer services) are granted access to it.

However, due to the nature of the information and related technology, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of your personal information and expressly disclaims any such obligation. If we learn of a security breach, then we will attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate steps.

## Usernames and Passwords

You need to protect against unauthorized access to your usernames and passwords. You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password. Therefore we recommend that you do not disclose your password to any third parties. If you choose to share your User ID and password or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.

## Authentication Information

When you use CloudWork to make connections between various web services we need authentication information to enable those connections on your behalf. Once you provide authentication details CloudWork will retrieve and modify data providing from these web services on your behalf, but only in a manner that is specified by the Service you choose.
