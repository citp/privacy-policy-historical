# Privacy Policy - Cloud Foundry

**PRIVACY POLICY OF CLOUD FOUNDRY.ORG FOUNDATION, INC.**  
(Effective Date January 26, 2017)

Cloud Foundry.Org Foundation, Inc. (“Cloud Foundry Foundation”) is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes the information Cloud Foundry Foundation collects about users of the Site (as defined below) and how that information may be used. This Privacy Policy applies to all Cloud Foundry Foundation websites (whether currently or in the future supported, hosted or maintained, including without limitation, cloudfoundry.org and any subdomains (each a “Site” and collectively, the “Sites”)). If you do not consent to the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy, then do not submit any information to Cloud Foundry Foundation and do not use the Sites.

**Changes to the Privacy Policy**

Cloud Foundry Foundation may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will be posted at cloudfoundry.org and will govern Cloud Foundry Foundation’s use of information about you. Cloud Foundry Foundation will notify users of material changes to the Privacy Policy by posting the amended terms on the cloudfoundry.org site prior to implementation or by directly sending users notification.

**Scope of Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy covers Cloud Foundry Foundation’s use and treatment of information collected by the Sites and personal information that you provide in connection with your use of the Sites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the data collection and use practices of third parties that Cloud Foundry Foundation does not own or control, including but not limited to, any third party services you access through Cloud Foundry Foundation, or to individuals that Cloud Foundry Foundation does not employ or manage.

**Children Under 13 Years of Age**

The Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13, and Cloud Foundry Foundation will never request personally identifiable information from anyone whom it knows to be under the age of 13 without verifiable parental or guardian consent. Cloud Foundry Foundation does not knowingly collect, or wish to obtain, personally identifiable information from children.

**User Information That Cloud Foundry Foundation Collects; Use of Cookies**

On the Sites, users may order products or services, register to receive materials or attend events, and submit responses to surveys or comments generally. Through user interaction with the Sites, Cloud Foundry Foundation may collect personal information submitted by such users to the Sites, including community forum content, diaries, profiles, photographs, names, geographic location, unique identifiers (e.g., social media handles or usernames), contact information (e.g., email address, postal address, telephone, fax), and transaction information. Cloud Foundry Foundation may also collect information users provide regarding their interests, demographics, industry, title, experience, and detailed contact preferences.

In order to access certain personalized services on the Sites, you may be asked to create a username and password for an account, which Cloud Foundry Foundation will store. However, users are responsible for all actions taken in their accounts and should select and safeguard their password accordingly.

When you make a payment to Cloud Foundry Foundation through Cloud Foundry Foundation’s payment page, our third party payment processor may collect credit card information from you in order to properly process your payment. Cloud Foundry Foundation does not store your credit card information and no one at Cloud Foundry Foundation can access your credit card information. We use RegOnline by Lanyon Solutions, Inc. (“RegOnline”), a PCI-certified third-party payment service to process payments. Although we do not process payments, we may require you to provide RegOnline with contact information (e.g., name, email address, and company name) and financial and billing information (e.g., billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of employees within your company). RegOnline’s privacy policy is found here: <http://lanyon.com/Terms-Conditions.aspx>.

Cloud Foundry Foundation and third-party service providers and advertisers who interact with Cloud Foundry Foundation, may also collect certain technical information about your use of the Sites. This technical information may include information about user device(s), browser type and version, geo-location, computer, computer connection, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Service, ad data, Wi-Fi connection, internet protocol (“IP”) address, and standard web log.

Cloud Foundry Foundation and third-party advertisers and service providers may use cookies, web beacons, locally shared objects (sometimes called “flash cookies”), and similar technologies in connection with your use of the Sites (collectively referred to as “Cookies”). If Cookies are used, they may be used to collect information about you and your use of the Sites, such as your browser type, preferences, data relating to content that has been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use. Cookies may also be used in order to further features and processes on the Sites, provide authentication and security for user transactions using the Site, store user preferences, facilitate relevant advertising, and help Cloud Foundry Foundation learn more about how users engage with the Sites.

Cloud Foundry Foundation also uses third-party service providers to provide certain products and services or to integrate other Site features. These third-party service providers may collect information when you view or use them, including information about you and your device or browser. They may do this using Cookies or similar technologies. These third-party service providers also may use Cookies or similar technologies to help share information with us, like how you use their website or application. Cloud Foundry Foundation encourages users to evaluate privacy and security policies of any of the Sites’ transaction partners before entering into transactions or choosing to disclose information.

For example, Cloud Foundry Foundation works with a service called Google Analytics provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help analyze how users use the Sites. The information generated by these cookies (including user truncated IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your, and other users’, use of the Sites and services, compiling reports about how you and others use the Sites and services and providing other services relating to activity on the Sites and Internet usage. Please note that Google only receives your truncated IP address. This is sufficient for Google to identify (approximately) the country from which you are using the Sites, but is not sufficient to identify you, or your computer or mobile device, individually. Google’s privacy policy is found here: <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245>. To opt-out of analysis by Google Analytics on our products and services and other services, please visit: <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.

As another example, Cloud Foundry Foundation works with a service provided by Salesforce.com, Inc. called Pardot B2B Marketing Automation (‘Pardot”) that uses Cookies for storing and organizing information Cloud Foundry Foundation receives from user interaction with the Sites, including but not limited to, your email address, name, company, the country from which you are using the site, and any comments.

**How Cloud Foundry Foundation Uses the Information Collected**

Cloud Foundry Foundation may use collected information for any lawful purpose related to Cloud Foundry Foundation’s business, including, but not limited to:

  1. To understand a user’s needs and create content that is relevant to the user;
  2. To generate statistical studies;
  3. To conduct market research and planning by sending user surveys;
  4. To notify user referrals of Cloud Foundry Foundation services, information, or products when a user requests that Cloud Foundry Foundation send such information to referrals;
  5. To improve services, information, and products;
  6. To help a user complete a transaction, or provide services or customer support;
  7. To communicate back to the user;
  8. To update the user on services, information, and products;
  9. To personalize a Site for the user;
  10. To notify the user of any changes with a Site which may affect the user;
  11. To enforce terms of use on a Site; and
  12. To allow the user to purchase products, access services, or otherwise engage in activities the user selects.



User names, identifications (“IDs”), and email addresses (as well as any additional information that a user may choose to post) may be publicly available on a Site when users voluntarily and publicly disclose personal information, such as when a user posts information in conjunction with content subject to an open source license, or as part of a message posted to a public forum or a publicly-released software application. The personal information you may provide to Cloud Foundry Foundation may reveal or allow others to discern aspects of your life that are not expressly stated in your profile (for example, your picture or your name may reveal your hair color, race or approximate age). You should be aware that your information may continue to be viewable to others after you close your account, such as on cached pages on Internet search engines. Users may not be able to change or remove public postings once posted. Such information may be used by visitors of these pages to send unsolicited messages. Cloud Foundry Foundation is not responsible for any consequences which may occur from the third-party use of information that a user chooses to submit to public pages. If you do not wish for others to view or access this information, please do not provide it to Cloud Foundry Foundation or post it on the Sites.

From time to time, Cloud Foundry Foundation may contact you with information, including promotional, marketing, and advertising information and recommendations that Cloud Foundry Foundation believes may be of interest to you. Consistent with applicable laws, including United States CAN-SPAM laws, if you do not wish to receive commercial emails, you may unsubscribe following the instructions on any email. Cloud Foundry Foundation may still send you administrative notices, however.

**Links to Third Party Web Sites**

The Sites may permit you to access or link to third party websites and information on the Internet, and other websites may contain links to the Sites. When a user uses these links, the user leaves the Sites. Cloud Foundry Foundation has not reviewed all of these third party sites, does not control, and is not responsible for, any of the third party sites, their content or privacy practices. The privacy and security practices of websites accessed from the Sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and Cloud Foundry Foundation is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites, including but not limited to, the third party services you access through Cloud Foundry Foundation. Please check the privacy and security policies of these websites before you submit any personal data.

**Sharing of Information**

Cloud Foundry Foundation may share the personally identifiable information a user provides online with other entities that are part of the Cloud Foundry Foundation corporate family, including our parent company, corporate affiliates, joint-venturers, and companies under common control, and/or outside service providers who may be used to distribute materials, create surveys, process credit cards, provide technical support, handle transaction processing, or otherwise act on Cloud Foundry Foundation’s behalf. Third-party service providers and suppliers receiving personal information are authorized to use such personal information only for the purpose it was originally intended or as required or permitted by law. Further, Cloud Foundry Foundation may share a user’s email and other personally identifiable information with its third party management services provider, The Linux Foundation, which may send email correspondence to the user on behalf of Cloud Foundry Foundation.

Cloud Foundry Foundation may disclose personal information that is associated with your profile as described in this Privacy Policy, as permitted by law or as reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) investigate and enforce our then-current Terms of Use, if any; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties, including DMCA notifications; (4) respond to customer service inquiries; (5) protect the rights, property, or safety of Cloud Foundry Foundation, our users, or the public; or (6) as part of the sale of all or a portion of the assets of Cloud Foundry Foundation or as a change in control of the organization or one of its affiliates or in preparation for any of these events. Cloud Foundry Foundation may supply any such information to any organization into which Cloud Foundry Foundation may merge in the future or to which it may make any transfer of assets. Any third party to which Cloud Foundry Foundation transfers or sells all or any of its assets will have the right to use the personal and other information that you provide in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.

**Data Security**

To keep your information safe, prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, Cloud Foundry Foundation implements industry-standard physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information Cloud Foundry Foundation collects. However, Cloud Foundry Foundation does not guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never defeat measures taken to prevent improper use of personally identifiable information. As a result, Cloud Foundry Foundation cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information transmitted on or through the Sites and you do so at your own risk.

Internal Cloud Foundry Foundation access to users’ nonpublic personally identifiable information is restricted to Cloud Foundry Foundation’s personnel, including contractors on a need-to-know basis. These individuals are bound by confidentiality agreements.

In the event Cloud Foundry Foundation becomes aware that the security of a Site has been compromised or users’ personally identifiable information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, Cloud Foundry Foundation will take reasonable response measures, including but not limited to, investigation and reporting, and notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities.

**International Data Protection**

Given the international scope of Cloud Foundry Foundation, personal information may be visible to persons outside your country of residence, including to persons in countries that your own country’s privacy laws and regulations deem deficient in ensuring an adequate level of protection for such information. If you are unsure whether this Privacy Policy is in conflict with applicable local rules, you should not submit your information. If you are located within the European Union, you should note that your information will be transferred to the United States, which is deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data protection.

**California Privacy Rights; Do Not Track**

Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code permits California residents to request from a business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, information related to the personal information disclosed by Cloud Foundry Foundation to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of the third parties with whom the business has shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident, you may make one request each year by emailing Cloud Foundry Foundation at info@cloudfoundry.org or sending a letter to:

Cloud Foundry Foundation  
1 Letterman Drive  
Building D, Suite 4700  
San Francisco, CA 94129

Please note that Cloud Foundry Foundation does not respond to “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms intended to allow California residents to opt-out of Internet tracking under The California Online Privacy Protection Action. Cloud Foundry Foundation may track and/or disclose your online activities over time and across different websites to third parties when you use the Sites. Cloud Foundry Foundation and third party advertising companies may track information concerning a user’s use of the Sites, such as a user’s IP address.

**Retention of Your Information**

We retain information about you for as long as it is necessary and relevant for Cloud Foundry Foundation’s operations. Information about you that is no longer necessary and relevant for our operations will be disposed of securely. In addition, we may retain information from closed accounts collected from you to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect fees, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, and take other actions permitted by law or disclosed in this Privacy Policy to enforce the Site’s terms and conditions and take other actions permitted by law. The information we retain will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy. ** **
