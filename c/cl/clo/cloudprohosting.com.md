# Privacy Policy - Cloud Based Web Hosting by Cloud Pro Hosting - 99.9% Uptime Web Hosting

## 1\. Introduction

Welcome to the Cloud Pro Hosting website, a company registered in and governed by the laws of the United States. 

Protecting your privacy is a serious matter and doing so is very important to cloudprohosting.com (also hereinafter referred to as "Cloud Pro Hosting", "we", "us" or "our").

However, none of the information stored in the Cloud Pro Hosting log files, including but not limited to IP addresses, is linked to Personal Information.

## Clear Gifs

We may use third party advertising partners that employ a software technology called Clear Gifs (also known as Web Beacons or Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our website by indicating to us which content is effective. Clear Gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
