## Security

### Totally Secure Shopping, Payment and Delivery

Our shopping platform has achieved the highest possible industry standard, independently reviewed security audit to achieve [Tier 1 PCI Compliance](https://web.archive.org/page/tier1pcicompliance). We are also independently accredited by the industry body for Interactive Selling Online - the [Interactive Media and Retail Group](http://www.imrg.org/isis) (IMRG.org). We have achieved BOTH ISIS (Internet Shopping is Safe) and IDIS (Internet Delivery is Safe) Accreditations from this body. You can only fully trust online shops from computer to delivery, that have correctly achieved both these accreditations.

Cloggs.co.uk uses the industry standard secure server software (Secure Socket Layer - 128 bit SSL Global Server Certificate) in association with DataCash and Verisign. Your financial and personal information, including credit card number, name and address, and phone number, are encrypted so that they cannot be viewed while travelling over the internet.

**Cloggs never takes payment for ordered goods until those goods are actually shipped or without the express prior consent of the customer.**

### Browser Warnings

Our website is designed to incorporate some sophisticated navigation and internet browsing technology which gives our customers the highest levels of functionality and buying options. In order to do this, it is necessary to use particular internet software languages like Java Script, and therefore if you have disabled certain browser features like Java Script, you will not be able to complete the checkout part of our website. Similarly, if you have activated the very highest levels of security on your browser, this sometimes disables Java Script automatically and inserts warning or dialogue boxes on https or secure web pages. All our information transfer, storage and use is 100% secure and verified by Verisign as per the seal above.

If you want to complete your purchase on Cloggs.co.uk, [click here](https://web.archive.org/page/noscript) to learn how to activate the Java Script settings in your browser. You can always reset them on completion of your transaction. Alternatively, you could place a telephone order with us without having to change your settings, just call +44 (0) 121 237 5510 (or visit our Birmingham Bullring store if you are in the area!).
