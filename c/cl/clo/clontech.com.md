We use third party service providers to perform functions or services on our behalf. When we transfer your information, we require all our service providers to maintain the privacy, confidentiality and security of the Personal Information and data. We take steps to ensure that these parties take protecting your privacy as seriously as we do.

_**Types of Service Providers.** _We engage third parties to perform services on our behalf such as software maintenance services, hosting services, email service providers, database management, web analytics, and other services.

The third-party processor does not store any credit card data associated with any purchases processed on the website.

_**Job Applicant Tracking System.** _When you apply for a job opening posted on our website, you submit Applicant Information through a third-party applicant tracking system that processes and stores your information and data.

_**Marketing Support Services.**_ Like many companies, we contract with third parties to provide customer relationship management ("CRM") tools for marketing purposes. Typically, these CRM tools are available for our use through a cloud-based platform (such as Salesforce). We engage third parties to provide CRM tools that compile customer Personal Information and data that may be collected through various channels, such as through the through the Sites, telephone, direct mail, marketing materials.

We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify users about law enforcement or court ordered requests for data unless otherwise prohibited by law. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to any third-party request to compel disclosure of your information.

_**Affiliates and Business Transfer.** _We may share your Personal Information with our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates. TBUSA may also sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.

**Security**

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. To help protect privacy and personal information you transmit through use of our Sites, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction by taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal data. For example, we encrypt your credit card number when you provide such information to us for processing your orders.

We restrict access to your Personal Information to those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, we train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information. However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we store, process or transmit.

TBUSA will use your Personal Information only for the purposes for which it was collected, unless you provide prior consent. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.

TBUSA complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries (including Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. TBUSA has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, TBUSA is subject to the regulatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, EU and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States. Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also may correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States under Privacy Shield, should direct their query to [privacy@takarabio.com](mailto:privacy@takarabio.com "privacy@takarabio.com"). If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

We will provide an individual opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive data, before we share your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to [privacy@takarabio.com](mailto:privacy@takarabio.com "privacy@takarabio.com").

In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

TBUSA's accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, TBUSA remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless TBUSA proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
