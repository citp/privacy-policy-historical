# Privacy Notice... - Clothes2order.com

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We want you to be able to place your order with us free from worry.

#### Information required to process your order

We require certain information to allow us to process your order. This includes your name, address, telephone number, and email address, as well as your credit or debit card number and expiry date.

We ask for your e-mail address to send you an order confirmation. We ask for your telephone number so that we can contact you should we need to discuss any details of your order.

#### Other information

From time-to-time we will e-mail you with exciting offers and promotions. This will help you take advantage of savings we may have on a product you normally order or an item that may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive emails regarding promotions, just 'opt out' and you will just receive emails regarding orders that you have placed.

Occasionally we may ask you to email us with your opinion on a particular subject, and may publish these comments, if you advise us that you do not wish to have your comment and name published, we will not do so.

#### Site tracking

We use tracking software to monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the site to better meet the needs of our customers. This software does not enable us to capture any personally identifying information.

#### Security facts

We offer the use of the latest secure server software (SSL version 3) which encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. When you place orders we offer the use of a secure server.

Furthermore, as required by the UK Data Protection Acts of 1984 and 1998, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you.

#### Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive, and enable us to provide features such as remembering your address, so that you don't have to re-enter it each time you make a booking (this service is opt-in). Cookies can be deleted from your hard drive if you wish. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to prevent that. Even without a cookie you can use most of the features on the web site.

#### Disclosure to third parties

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.

#### Security

Using your credit card to make purchases via our web site is a secure way to pay for your goods.

We have put a number of security steps in place to give you, the customer, total confidence when purchasing through the Internet:

  1. All sensitive information, including personal details as well as credit card information, is encrypted through the use of our secure server software (SSL). This means that information can only be exchanged between you and us, and that no third party can access this data. The padlock symbol on your browser () shows which pages are covered by this security system.
  2. All historical information regarding credit card, name, and address details is held on a secure computer. We do not retain live records of customer personal details or credit card information on our web servers after the transaction has been completed (i.e. you will need to enter your details each time you book over the Internet). 



#### Notes

Using a credit card may give you additional protection. Under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, if you have a claim against the seller for breach of contract or misrepresentation, you may also have a claim against your credit card issuer. This applies to goods or services costing more than £100 for one item (but less than £30,000), even if you have only used your card to pay a deposit. Further advice can be obtained from your local trading standards department or Citizen's Advice Bureau.

In addition, all the major credit card companies, along with IBM, Netscape Communications, and many others, are committed to the continuing development of open standards, in order to further improve the security of online transactions.

We want you to feel totally at ease every time you visit our site to get information, request a sample and place an order. If you still do not feel comfortable about leaving your credit card information on our secured Web site, please click on payment options or contact one of our customer care representatives at 0161 236 2206 and they'll be happy to help you with your order.
