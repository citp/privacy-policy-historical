<h1>Cloze, Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>
    <span id="_Toc511317819"></span>
    <span id="_Toc511316210">Effective: April 26, 2018</span>
</h2>
<p>
    Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy sets forth Cloze,
    Inc.’s (“Cloze”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) privacy practices in connection with
    Cloze’s websites located at cloze.com, clz.es (“Site” or “Sites”), the
    Cloze mobile applications, the Cloze web browser extensions, and the Cloze
    chat bots (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy applies only
    to information collected by Cloze from users of our Services and visitors
    of our websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information
    collected by Cloze in other ways, including offline. Access to the Services
    is provided pursuant to the Terms of Service accessible on our Sites and
    Services. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy,
    shall have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Service.
</p>
<h2>
    <span id="_Toc511317820"></span>
    <span id="_Toc511316211">Summary</span>
</h2>
<p>
    Because Cloze integrates with a variety of content imported, with your
    authorization, from your email, notes, files, reminders, calendar, phone,
    messaging, contacts, social media and other services, we take precautions
    to ensure that your personal information is protected.
</p>
<p>
    Rather than a dense legalistic Privacy Policy we have tried to write a
    clear, open and transparent Privacy Policy that an average human can
    understand without retaining a lawyer. Here are a few highlights about the
    personal information we collect through our Services, how we use it, and
    your choices about its use:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>We won’t sell your data.</li>
    <li>We won’t spam your email or social networks.</li>
    <li>We’ll be open and transparent as to how we will use your information within Cloze.</li>
</ul>

    <span id="_Toc511316237">The Cloze Services</span>
</h2>
<p>
    Cloze organizes and provides efficient means to access and receive updates
    regarding your contacts that may have been previously dispersed over many
    different Third Party Platforms.
</p>
<p>
    “Third Party Platforms” are software that integrate with our Services and
    that you have authorized to connect with Cloze. This may include email,
    calendar, messaging, file storage, phone services, note taking, reminders,
    social networking, and other cloud services such as Office 365, Gmail,
    Slack, Facebook, Dropbox, Evernote and other similar platforms from which
    you authorize us to import, search, and access, content.
</p>
<h2>
    <span id="_Toc511317827"></span>
    <span id="_Toc511316238">What Is Personal Information?</span>
</h2>
<p>
    “Personal Information” means any information relating to an identified or
    identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can
    be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
    identifier such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number or
    e-mail address, an identification number, location information, an online
    identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
    physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of
    that natural person. “Sensitive Personal Information” means racial or
    ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or
    trade union members, the processing of genetic, biometric data for purposes
    of uniquely identifying a natural person, and information concerning an
    individual’s health, sex life, or sexual orientation. We treat your
    Personal and Sensitive Personal Information as confidential.
</p>
<p>
    “Other Information” is any information that is not Personal Information or
    Sensitive Personal Information. Personal Information does not include
    anonymized or “aggregate” information, or publicly available information
    that has not been combined with Personal Information or Sensitive Personal
    Information.

    <span id="_Toc511317828"></span>
    <span id="_Toc511316239">
        What Information Do We Collect And When Do We Collect It?
    </span>
</h2>
<p>
    We may collect your Personal Information in the following circumstances:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        When you voluntarily provide it to us, such as when you register for an
        account by creating a username and password (“Cloze Login Credentials”),
        send us an email or post information or other content to our Site or
        Service;.
    </li>
    <li>
        When you choose to sign in to, or create a Cloze account, using a Third
        Party Platform login (for example, by choosing the “Sign in with Google”
        option on the Cloze website);
    </li>
    <li>
        When you connect a Third Party Platform with your Cloze account we may
        collect your credentials to that Third Party Platform if this is required
        in order to connect;
    </li>
    <li>
        If you apply for or purchase a Premium Service requiring billing or
        payment information on our Websites, we require that you provide certain
        additional Personal Information, including your address, phone number, and
        credit card number (“Payment Information”). This information is necessary
        to process your requests and to contact you.
    </li>
    <li>
        We may also collect Personal Information about you from your employer
        when your employer engages us to provide the Services to you. For example,
        we may obtain your name and email address from your employer.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When you utilize the Services, we also receive certain Other Information
    about you or your use of the Services. Such Other Information may be
    collected using various technologies, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Logs:</b> We track the data you see in Cloze and how you interact with it by
        automatically collecting certain information such as, the pages you visit
        or features you use within the Services, the date and time of your
        activities on the Services, the URLs from the websites you visit before and
        after navigating to the Services, your software and hardware attributes
        (including operating system type and version, App version, device type, and
        device identifiers, including IDFA and/or Advertising IDs), your browser
        type and version, and your general geographic location derived through your
        IP address (e.g., your city, state, or metropolitan region). To obtain such
        information, we may use web logs or applications that recognize your device
        and gather information about its online activity. We treat this information
        as Private Data if we combine it with or link it to any of the your
        Personal Information. Otherwise, it is used in aggregate form only. We use
        tracking data about individuals in an aggregated form to inform us about
        how Cloze is being used to help us provide a better user experience.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Cookies:</b> Like almost all websites today, Cloze uses cookies to determine
        whether you are logged in on your computer and to recognize repeat
        visitors. We send cookies to your computer in order to uniquely identify
        your browser and improve the quality of our Services. Cookies are small
        pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive
        while you are viewing a site. We may use both session cookies (which expire
        once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your
        computer until you delete them). If you wish to restrict or block the
        cookies which are set by Cloze, or by any other website, you can do this
        through your browser settings. Please note, if you choose to disable
        cookies, some of our Services may not work properly or at all.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Web beacons:</b> The Services or the emails that you receive from us may use
        an application known as a “web beacon” (also known as a “clear gif” or
        “pixel tag”). A web beacon is an electronic file that usually consists of a
        single-pixel image. It can be embedded in a web page or in an email to
        transmit information. For example, it allows an email sender to determine
        whether a user has opened a particular email.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Local storage:</b> We may collect and store information (including Personal
        Information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web
        storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Cloze keeps Personal Information contained in your cookies and obtained
    through the other tracking technologies confidential. We do not set any
    cookies outside of the cloze.com and clz.es domains.
</p>
<p>
    We also may partner with certain third parties to collect, analyze, and use
    some of the Personal and Other information described in this section. For
    example, we may allow third parties to set cookies or use web beacons on
    the Services or in email communications from Cloze. This information may be
    used for a variety of purposes, including analytics and online behavioral
    advertising.
</p>

<h2>
    <span id="yourcontent">Your Content</span>
</h2>

<p>
    When you authorize Cloze to access Third Party Platforms, we collect,
    store, and process “Content” on your behalf. Content are all communication
    records and documents (including your contacts, messages, files, call
    records, notes, meetings, email and other similar information) from Third
    Party Platforms that you have authorized Cloze to access, similar
    information you directly enter in Cloze (for example, when sending emails,
    creating new contacts, adding notes, setting reminders, etc.), as well as
    information Cloze discovers and provides to you (for example, public
    information about your contacts, when contacts of yours open emails you
    sent from Cloze, etc.). By its nature, Content will often contain Personal
    Information (for example, an email will contain the sender and recipient’s
    email addresses).
</p>
<p>
    Cloze has no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personal
    Information is contained in your Content. An individual who seeks access,
    or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his
    query to you. We provide tools to allow you to export, delete, or update
    Content so you can comply with these requests.
</p>

</h2>
<p>
    As with your Personal Information, we will treat your Content as
    confidential private data except for the uses and disclosures described in
    this Privacy Policy. Your Content is stored securely on our servers and
    will remain private to you, within your Cloze account, unless you choose to
    share or disclose it to another user or service, or as described below when
    you join a Cloze Business Team.
</p>
<p>
    We use a number of technologies to help you get the most out of the
    Service. Our systems automatically analyze your Content to power Cloze
    features and to continually improve the Service for you. This may include,
    for example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Making sure you find what you’re looking for when you search your
        Content;
    </li>
    <li>
        Showing you the most relevant contacts in any given situation;
    </li>
    <li>
        Suggesting actions based on previous communication or other Content;
    </li>
    <li>
        Suggesting updates to your contacts with new or additional information;
        and
    </li>
    <li>
        Linking Content to relevant contacts so you see everything related to
        them.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You may explicitly choose to share Content with other Cloze users or with
    Third Party Platforms.
</p>
<p>
    When you share Content with another Cloze user, Cloze provides privacy
    controls to allow to you to choose what information to share (by default,
    Cloze will not share the following Content with your co-workers: home or
    personal addresses from your contacts or messages from friends and
    families). There are many privacy controls within Cloze that you can take
    advantage of to control what information gets shared and when. When you
    choose to share Content with other Cloze users, the shared Content becomes
    Private Data in their Cloze account as well as yours. However, there are no
    restrictions on these users from sharing that Private Data, through the
    Service or otherwise, with any third parties, or using that Private Data
    for any purpose. For example, if you share a note with another Cloze user,
    they could copy, paste, and email that note to a colleague – just as if you
    email someone, they could forward that email to someone else. Once you
    share Content with other users, there are no restrictions on those users
    from sharing that Content through the Services or otherwise with any third
    parties or using the Content for any purpose.
</p>
<p>
    When you authorize a Third Party Platform to access Content from your Cloze
    account (for example, to make contacts in your Cloze account available on
    another device), please be aware that those platforms are not operated by
    Cloze and Cloze is not responsible for the content or practices of those
    platforms. The collection, use, and disclosure of your information will be
    subject to the privacy policies of the Third Party Platforms, and not this
    Policy.

        What Content gets shared when you join a Cloze Business Team?
    </span>
</h2>
<p>
    If you accept an invitation to join a Cloze Business Team, some of your
    Content, or aggregate information about your business-related Content, may
    be shared with other team members automatically, while other Content will
    only be shared if you choose to share it. Summary Information and some
    Contact Information may be shared automatically, while Communications
    Information will be shared only after you have been presented with the
    opportunity to approve or decline sharing.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Summary Information:</strong>
        Summary information may be visible to other team members at any time,
        but the content of your communication and your contact information will
        not be visible. Some examples of summary information are counts of the
        number of calls, emails, and other communication you have exchanged
        with business (not personal) contacts, and when you last communicated
        with a business (not personal) contact.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Contact Information:</strong>
        When you are assigned to follow-up with a business contact or you are
        added to a project or deal team, you will be notified, and
        business-related contact information (such as work email addresses –
        not home, personal, or private fields) may be shared with your team.
        You can separately control whether communication will be visible to
        other team members. Any contacts that you have flagged as personal or
        private will never have contact information shared with your team.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Communications:</strong>
        Details of your communications with business contacts are only shared
        once you have been notified and have had a chance to either approve or
        deny sharing either in bulk or on a per message basis. Cloze provides
        many privacy controls to allow you to choose what content is shared and
        when. Any contacts that you have flagged as personal or private will
        never have their communication information shared with your team.

        What Information Do We Share With Third Parties?
    </span>
</h2>
<p>
    Cloze exists to make your professional network more actionable, not to sell
    your data. However, we share personal information as follows:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Service Providers, Agents and Related Third Parties:</strong>
    We sometimes hire other companies to help us provide the Services to you.
    Examples include third-party payment processors, companies who send emails
    on our behalf, and providers who are working with us in connection with the
    operation of our Services. Such service providers are only provided with
    the information they need to perform their specific function, will only use
    your Personal Information to perform the services requested by us, and we
    make efforts to ensure they are subject to confidentiality restrictions
    consistent with this Privacy Policy.<strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Requests to other Cloze users (and non-users):</strong>
    Some communications you initiate through Cloze (e.g., an invitation sent to
    a non-user or a task you assign to another Cloze user) will list your
    primary email address and name in the header of the message.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Contact Enrichment:</strong>
    In order to ensure your contacts are as complete and accurate as
    possible, we may search for public information about your contacts in
    Third-Party Platforms you have connected to your Cloze account. In
    addition, we may check for public information about your contacts from
    third party data providers. In order to do so, we share a subset of
    information from your contacts (such as your contact’s email address), but
    do not disclose any information about you to the data provider (the data
    provider does not know on whose behalf we are making the requests). In such
    cases, we require such third parties to agree to confidentiality
    restrictions and to meet privacy standards at least as stringent as ours in
    protecting your data for such purpose.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Your direct sharing of Personal Information through third-party
            websites and services:</strong>
    The Services may enable you to explicitly share Content with websites or
    online services operated by third parties. For example, the Services
    contain links to third-party websites that incorporate comment and social
    media features. The Services also contains a Facebook “like” button and a
    Twitter “follow” button. If you choose to use these features, you may
    disclose your personal information not just to those Third-Party Platforms,
    but also to their users and the public more generally. Because these
    Third-Party Platforms are not operated by Cloze, Cloze is not responsible
    for the content or practices of those platforms. The collection, use, and
    disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy policies of
    the Third-Party Platforms, and not this Policy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Third-party plugins:</strong>
    The Services integrate certain third-party plug-ins (such as a Facebook
    “like” button). Even if you do not click on these plug-ins, they may
    collect information about you, such as your IP address and the pages that
    you view. They also may set and/or access a cookie. These plugins are
    governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Facebook Custom Audiences and Similar Programs:</strong>
    We may partner with Facebook and other social media partners to deliver
    advertisements to our users via the Facebook Custom Audiences program or
    similar third-party programs. In order to identify and reach our users on
    Facebook or another third-party service, we may share information such as
    an email address or phone number with Facebook or another third-party
    service. For more information about custom audience targeting and how to
    adjust your social media advertising preferences, please review the privacy
    policy of your social media provider.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>With Your Consent:</strong>
    We may share your Personal Information when you give us your consent to do
    so, including if we notify you on our Services that the information you
    provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such
    information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Legal Processes:</strong>
    We may also disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law
    or when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or
    required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate
    to comply with the law or legal processes or respond to lawful requests or
    legal authorities, including responding to lawful subpoenas, warrants or
    court orders; when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our
    rights or the rights, property or safety of others; to enforce or apply our
    Privacy Policy, our Terms of Service or our other policies or agreements.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Business Transfers:</strong>
    We might sell or buy business assets. We may share your Personal
    Information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale
    of company assets, financing or acquisition, or in any other situation
    where Personal Information may be disclosed or transferred as one of the
    business assets of us.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Analytics:</strong>
    We partner with certain third parties to collect the Other Information
    discussed above and to engage in analysis, auditing, research, and
    reporting. These third parties may use web logs or web beacons, and they
    may set and access cookies or use similar tracking technologies on your
    computer or other device. In particular, our Services use Google Analytics
    and Mixpanel. You may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics
    <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>,
    and Mixpanel <a href="https://mixpanel.com/optout/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Online Interest-Based Advertising:</strong>
    The Services also enable third-party tracking mechanisms to collect your
    Other Information for use in online interest-based advertising. For
    example, third parties may use the fact that you visited our website or
    used our mobile app to target online ads to you. In addition, our
    third-party advertising networks might use information about your use of
    our website or app to help target advertisements based on your online
    activity in general. For information about interest-based advertising
    practices, including privacy and confidentiality, visit the
    <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/">
        Network Advertising Initiative
    </a>
    website or the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>
    website.
</p>
<p>
    The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to those
    third parties’ own privacy policies, and not this privacy policy. If you
    prefer to prevent third parties from setting and accessing cookies on your
    computer or other device, you may set your browser to block cookies.
    Additionally, you may remove yourself from the targeted advertising of
    companies within the Network Advertising Initiative by opting out    <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/">here</a>, or of
    companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance by opting out    <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/">here</a>. If you are an
    individual of the EU or Switzerland, you may opt-out    <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">here</a>. Although our Services
    currently do not respond to “do not track” browser headers, you can limit
    tracking through these third-party programs and by taking the other steps
    discussed above.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the opt-out will apply only to the specific browser or
    device from which you opt out, and therefore you will need to opt out
    separately on all of your browsers and devices. If you delete or reset your
    cookies or mobile identifiers, change browsers, or use a different device,
    any opt-out cookie or tool may no longer work and you will have to opt out
    again.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Aggregated information:</strong>
    We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with
    our partners. Such aggregated information does not identify individual
    users. We do not link this aggregate user data with personal information.
    Our Privacy Policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of
    aggregate user data.
