         Clover may also collect IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) to track a user’s
session while the user remains anonymous. We analyze this data for certain trends in statistics,
such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there.
         3.        How is my information used?
         Clover will not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information to others
without your consent. The information you provide will be used to support your organization’s
customer relationship with Clover. Your information may be shared with agents, contractors or
business partners for the purpose of performing services for Clover.
        We want to help you quickly find information on Clover and alert you to specific offers,
updated information, and other new products and services from Clover. Accordingly, we may
send you direct mailings or contact you by telephone about our various products and services or
other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive such
mailings, simply “opt-out” by the means provided for in the mailings or by contacting
privacy@cloversites.com.
         Please note that Clover does research on our users’ demographics, interests and behavior
based on the information provided to us during your use of the Clover Web site. This research is
compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. Aggregated data does not include personally
identifiable information. Clover may share this aggregated data with others.
         4.        Who is collecting my information?
        When you are on Clover’s site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing
that information with Clover alone, unless specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected
and/or maintained by any company other than Clover or an agent for Clover, you will be notified
prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you
can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service or purchasing those
particular goods.
         5.        With whom does Clover share my information?
        We may share the personal data you provide with other Clover agents, contractors or our
business partners for the purposes of performing services for Clover. Clover also may share
aggregated data with others. Aggregated data does not include personally identifiable
information. We also believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent,
or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to
the physical safety of any person, violations of the Terms of Access, or as otherwise required by

law. Except as provided above or in the event of a merger, consolidation, or sale of all or
substantially all of Clover’s assets, we will not share any of your information with any third
party without your permission.
         6.        How do I access, update or delete my information?
        You can request the individual information that Clover has collected about you, correct
factual inaccuracies in your information, remove personal information from Clover’s databases
and/or update your personal information by contacting privacy@cloversites.com.
         7.        What does “opt-out” mean?
        To “opt-out” means that you have notified Clover that we no longer have permission to
use your information for one or more purposes identified on the notice. For example, when we
send you information on a new product, you will be given the opportunity to “opt-out” of
receiving such information in the future.
         8.        What else should I know about my privacy?
        Third party Internet sites and services accessible through Clover have separate privacy
and data collection practices, independent of us. Clover has no responsibility or liability for
these independent policies or actions. Please be careful and responsible online. If you post
personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited
messages from other parties in return. While we strive to protect your information, Clover cannot
ensure or warrant the security of any information through the transmission process and you do so
at your own risk.

Use ( http://www.cloversites.com/legal/terms_of_service.pdf), including limitations on damages
and application of the law of the State of California. If you have any concern about your privacy
in connection with this policy, please send us a thorough description to
privacy@cloversites.com, and we will try to resolve it. We may post a revised privacy policy on
our site. Please note that the use of information that we gather is subject to the privacy notice in
effect at the time of use. You should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes.
