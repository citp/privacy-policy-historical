This CloudBerry Lab Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") describes how CloudBerry Lab and its affiliates (together, "CloudBerry Lab" or "we") gather and process your information. CloudBerry Lab Ltd. recognizes the importance of protecting your personal information and is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.

### Where This Privacy Policy Applies

This Privacy Policy applies to use of public portions of CloudBerryLab.com (including <https://www.cloudberrycentral.com/>), registered users of our [standalone products](https://www.cloudberrylab.com/products.aspx), and registered users of the CloudBerry Managed Backup Service ([https://mbs.cloudberrylab.com](https://mbs.cloudberrylab.com/), [https://mspbackups.com](https://mspbackups.com/)) (collectively, the **"Services"** ). If a particular part of the Services posts its own privacy policy (for example, such as the Privacy Policy for the CloudBerry Managed Backup Service), then that policy, not this Privacy Policy, applies when inconsistent.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that is collected by any third-party website or service that you access through the Services.

It requires businesses to protect the personal data and privacy of EU citizens. It also requires that companies have appropriate data security in place to protect personal data. The GDPR comes into force on May 25, 2018.

CloudBerry Lab is compliant with new regulation requirements. It acts as a data processor for customers personal data; all processing of personal data is performed in accordance with privacy rights and regulations following the GDPR.
