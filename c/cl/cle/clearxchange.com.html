					<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
					<p>
						This Privacy Policy only applies to the information collected on
						the website located at www.clearxchange.com ("Website"). By
						visiting the Website, you accept the practices described in this
						Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions,
						you are not permitted to use the Website. Please also make sure
						you read our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a> to understand
						the additional terms and conditions that apply to your use of the
						Website.
					</p>
					<p>The terms "you" and "your," as used in this Privacy Policy,
						refer to each individual and entity accessing this Website for any
						reason. The terms "we" and "CXC" both mean clearXchange, LLC.</p>
					<b>Overall privacy statement</b><br> <br>
					<p>We gather certain types of information about our users, so
						we want to help you understand the terms and conditions
						surrounding the collection and use of that information. This
						Privacy Policy discloses the types of information we gather, how
						we use it, and with whom the information may be shared, and how to
						correct or change it. The Website contains links to other sites,
						and those sites might have privacy policies that differ from this
						Privacy Policy.</p>
					<b> 1. What information does CXC collect, and what does CXC do
						with it?</b><br> <br>
					<p>Your Internet browser has a feature called "cookies" which
						stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to
						our Website. However, cookies tell us nothing about who you are
						unless you specifically give us personally identifiable
						information. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit
						our Website, but certain features may not be available to you if
						you disable or delete cookies created during your visits. You may
						elect not to allow cookies to be collected by selecting certain
						options on your browser. CXC also automatically receives and
						records information from our servers and from your browser,
						including your IP address, the time, and information about the
						page you requested. We may use tracking technologies for a variety
						of purposes, including but not limited to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>keeping count of return visits to our Website;</li>
						<li>accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate,
							statistical information regarding our Website and usage of the
							Website for CXC’s own use and summary distribution to third
							parties;</li>
						<li>determining which pages you use most;</li>
						<li>providing content targeted to your interests and usage of
							our Website;</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We also collect information when you voluntarily submit it
						to us. In many cases, your submission will include personally
						identifiable information. We may use this personally identifiable
						information for a variety of purposes, including but not limited
						to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>contacting you about a question or feedback that you have
							submitted through the Website;</li>
						<li>contacting you about potential business opportunities if
							you have expressed an interest in such opportunities;</li>
						<li>contacting you regarding sales and marketing activities;
							and</li>
						<li>communicating with you regarding changes or enhancements
							to our policies and services or issues regarding your account.</li>
					</ul>
					<b>2. Will CXC share my information?</b><br> <br>
					<p>
						CXC will not share your personally identifiable information with
						any third-party advertiser or marketing organization without first
						receiving your consent, unless (a) we are working with other
						companies to provide you with information or services that you
						have requested, (b) CXC reasonably believes that your personally
						identifiable information should be shared to respond to a
						subpoena, court order or other legal process, or (c) your actions
						violate the law, our Website’s <a href="terms.html">Terms of
							Use</a>, or threaten the rights or safety of CXC or any person. If
						you use the services of one of CXC’s affiliates, you grant us
						permission to send your personally identifiable information to
						that affiliate. Our affiliates’ use of such information is
						governed by their respective privacy policies. Additionally, we
						may share non-personally identifiable information with anyone for
						any legal purpose, including but not limited to sharing it with
						advertisers, investors, and in the course of making presentations.
						If CXC is acquired by or merged with another company, CXC may
						transfer personally identifiable information about you to the
						acquiring company.
					</p>
					<b>3. What are my options?</b><br> <br>
					<p>
						Users that need to change their information with CXC, or users
						that do not want to receive updates and information about new CXC
						services, may contact us with the request by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@clearXchange.com">privacy
							@clearXchange.com</a>. Additionally, users who would rather not
						provide any of the user data requested by our online forms may
						contact us via telephone with their question or comment. If you
						have a question about the opt-out process that is not answered in
						this Privacy Policy, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@clearXchange.com">privacy
							@clearXchange.com</a>.
					</p>
					<b>4. What security procedures are in place to protect against
						the loss, misuse or alteration of information in CXC’s control?</b><br>
					<br>
					<p>CXC uses commercially reasonable security measures to
						attempt to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of
						your user data under our control. While we cannot guarantee that
						loss, misuse, or alteration to data will not occur, we take
						commercially reasonable precautions to prevent such unfortunate
						occurrences. No data transmission over the Internet can be
						guaranteed to be 100% secure. Indeed, as you probably know,
						despite our use of industry standard security technologies, third
						parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or
						private communications. As a result, while we will use reasonable
						efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or
						warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.</p>
					<b>5. How will I know if the Privacy Policy changes?</b><br> <br>
					<p>Any modifications to our privacy practices will be reflected
						first in this notice of our Privacy Policy. If there is a material
						change in our privacy practices, we will indicate on our Website
						that our privacy practices have changed and provide a link to the
						new privacy statement. If we are going to be using the information
						collected from users in a manner materially different from that
						stated at the time of collection, we may notify affected users of
						the change via e-mail. Please note that, at all times, you are
						responsible for updating your personal information to provide us
						your current email address. If the last email address that you
						have provided us is not valid, or for any other reason is not
						capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our
						dispatch of the email containing such notice will nonetheless
						constitute effective notice of the changes described in the
						notice. Changes to this Privacy Policy may affect our use of
						personal information that you provided us prior to our
						notification to you of the changes. If you do not wish to permit
						changes in our use of your information, you must notify us prior
						to the effective date of the changes that you wish to deactivate
						your account with us.</p>
					<b>Questions, comments</b><br> <br>
					<p>
						Questions regarding this privacy statement, or regarding any other
						aspects of the Website, should be sent via e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@clearXchange.com">privacy
							@clearXchange.com</a>.
