<b><b>CLEVELAND LIVE</b> PRIVACY POLICY</b>
</p><p>

The <b>Cleveland Live</b> Web site is maintained by <b>Cleveland Live, 700 West St. Clair Avenue, Suite 414, Cleveland, OH 44113</b>.  We can be reached  by e-mail at <b><a href="mailto:webmaster@cleveland.com">webmaster@cleveland.com</a></b>.
</p><p>
<u><b>HOW <b>Cleveland Live</b> USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU:</b></u> This site does not
collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when
specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals.  A user’s
personally identifiable information may be used by <b>Cleveland Live</b> and its
affiliates for editorial purposes.  <b>We</b> may also use such
information for marketing and promotional purposes. <b>Cleveland Live</b> may share
your personally identifiable information with other companies with which it
conducts business.  For example, if you enter our contests, make a purchase,
or use our e-mail services, we sometimes rely on outside companies to
provide these services to you. In such cases, we need to provide your
personally identifiable information to them. We also sometimes provide your
information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet
your needs. While <b>Cleveland Live</b> will seek to require such third parties to
follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this
information except for the express purpose for which it was provided,
<b>Cleveland Live</b> does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies
of any third parties.
</p><p>
<b>Except for purposes outlined above, we do not provide, sell or lease your
personally identifiable information to any third parties, unless otherwise
stated at the time of collection.  If you have any questions or concerns
regarding what is done with your information on any part of <b>Cleveland Live</b>,
please e-mail us at <b><a href="mailto:webmaster@cleveland.com">webmaster@cleveland.com</a></b>, <i>before</i> submitting any information.</b>
</p><p>
We also collect anonymous, aggregated data and provide it to our advertisers
and other companies that we do business with for market research and
statistical purposes.  For example, we might report to our advertisers that
a certain percentage of users are between the ages of 30-35.
</p><p>
Finally, you should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally
identifiable information  (e.g., first and last name, address, e-mail
address, etc.) on the forums or in the chat areas, that information can be
collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from
other posters or parties.
</p><p>
<b><u>COOKIES:</u></b> <b>Cleveland Live</b> may place a “cookie” in the browser files of <b>Cleveland Live</b>
user’s computer.  The cookie may contain personally identifiable
information.  Cookies enable <b>Cleveland Live</b> to serve information that you have
requested, or to relate your use of  <b>Cleveland Live</b> to information that you
have specifically and knowingly provided to <b>Cleveland Live</b>.  You also may
occasionally get cookies from our advertisers.  <b>Cleveland Live</b> does not control
these cookies and these cookies are not subject to this policy.  The use of
advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is common in the Internet
industry.  Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.  If you
prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when
cookies are being sent.  However, it is possible that some portions of
<b>Cleveland Live</b> will not function properly if you do so.  For further

provide help regarding your browser’s cookie settings.

<b>CHILDREN:  Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any
information about yourself (your name, address, e-mail address, etc.) to us
or anyone else over the Internet, and before making any purchases online.
If you are under the age of 13, you are not allowed to use this service. 
</b>
</p><p>
<b>PARENTS:</b>  We encourage you to get involved with your children’s online usage
and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating.  
This service is not intended for users under the age of 13.  This service does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13.  Such users are expressly prohibited from submitting their personally identifiable information to us, and from using our forums and chat areas; any information submitted by such users will not knowingly be used, posted, or retained by us. Any personally identifiable information collected by Cleveland Live from children above 13 (that we are aware are children above the age 13)
will be used only for <b>Cleveland Live</b>
internal purposes such as market research, sweepstakes fulfillment, and for
fulfilling requests for information or materials, and may sometimes be
included in our database.  However, such information will not be posted or
published by us, or provided to any third parties, without your prior
consent.  Additionally, anonymous aggregated data is sometimes provided to
other companies with which we do business, for statistical and market
research purposes as described above.  Finally, you should be aware that if
your child voluntarily discloses his name,
e-mail address, etc. on various forums or chat areas, such disclosure may
result in unsolicited messages from other parties.  Accordingly, you should
discourage your child from doing so.
