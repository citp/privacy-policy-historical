**MAINTAINING THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO CLEARFIT.**

This Privacy Policy applies to ClearFit. This Privacy Policy describes how ClearFit collects and uses the personal information you provide to our Site: http://www.clearfit.com and other related ClearFit sites.  It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy you should first contact ClearFit Customer Service at [info@ClearFit.com](mailto:info@ClearFit.com).

**We want to ensure that your experience with ClearFit is a comfortable, safe and secure one.   **It is important to us that you are aware of exactly where and how both general information concerning your visit to our Site and your submitted personal information is or may be used. This will be described in this Privacy Policy below.

### Privacy Information for Users of the Site – Collection, Use and Disclosure

When you arrive at ClearFit.com you may visit various areas of our Site and click on certain links and buttons to search for and review additional information about career opportunities, potential candidates, and the ClearFit Program.

### Log Files

ClearFit gathers information by logging IP addresses, browser type, operating system, referring/exit page, date/time stamp, and aggregate survey results. The logged information is only used in the aggregate and is not tied to personal information unless you have registered to join the Site. For example, we will keep a record of the aggregate number of visitors who access each area of our Site, which areas of our Site receive the heaviest traffic and what services offered through ClearFit are utilized most frequently. The information collected by us will assist in the continual process of updating and improving our Site so that your visit to ClearFit will be as rewarding and complete as possible. From time to time we may share this aggregate statistical information with our participating Employers and partners.

### Using the Services

Candidates who join the Site (as defined in the Terms of Use) to obtain Services receive Career Feedback Reports.  Employers will receive special products, pricing and promotions that are not otherwise available. Candidates can learn more about their work-related personality and motivation characteristics and learn what jobs and Employers fit them best.  In order to provide our unique service to Users, we are required to collect relevant personal information, including psychometric, job search, and recruitment-related information during User registration.

For Candidates, this personal information includes the results of their ClearFit Online Survey, employment history, past education, skills, certifications and contact information and such personal information is stored in a secure third-party cloud environment. We call this the Candidate’s personal profile information.

For Employers, collected information includes their job description criteria, candidates, hiring criteria, including education, personality, motivation, experience criteria and contact information and this information is stored in a secure third-party cloud. We call this the employer’s job profile and Registration information.

Employers collect personal information when they obtain the results of the psychometric survey answered by Candidates, which involves a series of questions and employment/education-related criteria which compares Candidates against Employers’ corresponding job-related criteria in the database, based on personality, interests and other job-related criteria. The Career Feedback Reports Candidates receive as part of the ClearFit application process are theirs alone and completely confidential. Candidates always control who has access to their personal information. Participating Employers may access Candidates’ personal profile data and the interpretation of raw survey scores to create their own reports, but not their personal information without that Candidate’s consent. When a Candidate applies to an Employer using the Site, they consenting to the use of their personal information by that Employer solely in connection with the hiring process to make more accurate hiring decisions, based on how candidates’ personal profiles match against their job profiles.

All Users acknowledge and agree that their personal information collected by ClearFit may stored, transferred, and processed across national boundaries in any of the countries where ClearFit and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices, including, without limitation, the United States, United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Philippines, Australia and of course, Canada.  These jurisdictions may have data protection laws differ from those of Canada and as a result, personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions.  For example, information may be shared in response to valid demands or requests from government authorities, courts and law enforcement officials in those countries or when required by law where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with an appropriate law enforcement investigation, current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Site. Subject to applicable laws in such other jurisdictions, ClearFit will use reasonable efforts to ensure that appropriate protections are in place to maintain protections on personal information that are equivalent to those that apply in Canada.

### Feedback/Communication and Choice

From time-to-time our Site may contact Users via surveys, email communications, or contests. Participation in these surveys, email communications, or contests is completely voluntary and the User therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose their job search-related information. Information requested may include any job search-related information, such as contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Information collected will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use, satisfaction and services of this Site.

### How else is personal information used?

ClearFit may, on occasion, share some or all of your personal information with third party service providers for processing and data analysis.. For Employers, in order to process credit card transactions, ClearFit must share your credit card information with our credit card processors to complete our billing process. For all users, in order to analyze our sites’ performance, we use emails to identify users inside our third party systems. These third parties may be located in other jurisdictions that may have data protection laws differ from those of Canada and as a result, personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions. Therefore, your information may be processed and stored in other jurisdictions and, as a result, other governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through foreign laws. As discussed earlier, subject to applicable laws in such other jurisdictions, ClearFit will use reasonable efforts to ensure that appropriate protections are in place to maintain protections on personal information that are equivalent to those that apply in Canada. Regardless, all third party service providers that do work for ClearFit are bound by various legal agreements that do not permit them to use the Users’ personal information except as to otherwise specifically provided and explicitly prohibit them from using such personal information for their own purposes (including their own marketing purposes or otherwise disclose such information to any third parties). We may disclose and ultimately transfer personal information in the context of a business transaction involving the reorganization, acquisition or amalgamation of our business or the sale of all or some of our assets provided that the personal information disclosed is required to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring this information. In such event, after a reorganization, acquisition, amalgamation or sale has occurred, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you (either by posting notice on the Site or by email to you at the last known email address) that such a business transaction has occurred.

## Anti-Spam Policy

### Spam Defined

ClearFit.com strictly prohibits members engaging in spam and other tactics which may constitute abuse of the Internet in order to seek referrals. What is Spam? Generally speaking, activities which would constitute spam include the sending of: (i) unsolicited commercial e-mail, (ii) unsolicited bulk e-mail, (iii) mass e-mail, and/or (iv) junk e-mail, containing a message that advertises goods or services. The defining feature of spam is that the e-mail is sent to someone without their prior consent or in the absence of a previous relationship between the sender and the recipient. Spam is the electronic equivalent of the junk mail you receive in your postal mailbox every day or those telemarketers who call at dinner time!

Spam can take several different forms. When someone logs on to Usenet or message boards and sends or posts messages which are unrelated to the topic of discussion, that’s spam. In addition, the sending of an electronic mail message addressed to a recipient with whom the sender does not have an existing business or personal relationship or is not sent at the request of, or with the express consent of, the recipient constitutes spam. The act of engaging in activities which constitute spam is called spamming.

Other types of Internet abuse may also qualify as spam. Examples include, spamming of chat rooms and spamming via Internet Relay Chat or “Instant Messaging” systems (such as ICQ). In reality, the various methods of spamming will continue to evolve with the Internet as new ways of online communication between people develop.

### We Don’t Like Spam

No one likes sorting through junk mail or talking to telemarketers, but spam is even worse! Electronic junk mail costs recipients of spam more time and money than it costs the sender. The unwitting recipient of spam is required to download, sort through, and identify what e-mail is legitimate and what e-mail is junk e-mail, and then discard it. If the recipient pays for Internet access by the hour or minute, then sorting through spam messages leads to increased time online, which translates into higher monthly bills from their Internet Service Provider.

Conduct on the Internet is governed by an unwritten set of rules called ‘Netiquette,’ and one of those rules is that it’s not acceptable to send out unsolicited mass e-mail. Spam can also slow the performance of the Internet. There have been instances where large volumes of spam have slowed down e-mail delivery for hours (or even days!). Spam sometimes causes computers on the Internet to crash. Most importantly, we feel that spamming is just plain rude.

### Our Anti-Spam Policy

ClearFit’s referral program is meant to encourage people to introduce the benefits of ClearFit to their friends and family, and to people with whom they transact with online. We do not intend to, nor do we encourage, the use of spam under any circumstances.

Upon receipt of a credible complaint concerning spamming, ClearFit may immediately suspend the membership of the individual who is alleged to have conducted the spamming. A suspension of membership privileges is intended to prevent a possible spammer from continuing to benefit from their activities by prohibiting the registration of referrals or the accruing of additional referral payments. If the spamming incident is not verified after a through investigation by ClearFit , the suspension may be lifted and all referrals and referral payments which have accrued during the period of suspension will be restored. ClearFit may, but is not obligated to, lift a suspension imposed on a member due to alleged spamming activities.

Anyone who is found by ClearFit to have spammed other Internet users in an attempt to gain referral bonuses will lose their ClearFit membership privileges and their account will be terminated. Any referral bonuses acquired in the spammer’s account will be confiscated by ClearFit . Any monies which remain in the spammer’s account after confiscation of referral bonuses will be returned to the account holder.

### How to Report Spammers

If you feel that a member of ClearFit has spammed you, please contact info@ClearFit.com. Be sure to include evidence of the spamming such as a copy of the e-mail, posting or message with full message headers or the usenet message. It would assist our efforts in confirming your complaint if you include any other information that can be used to identify the parties involved. An incomplete complaint may result in delays in the enforcement of our Anti-Spam Policy.

### How do I avoid engaging in Spam when making Referrals?

We created the ClearFit Referral Program to reward our members for introducing the ClearFit Program to their friends and family, and to people they transact with online. There are many ways in which you can participate in our referral program without resorting to spam. Here are a few guidelines to help you:

* Make sure you know the Person.

You can tell anyone who you know and whom you think might benefit from our service about ClearFit.com and the ClearFit Program. This includes friends, family, business and other acquaintances. In addition you should feel free to talk to anyone who asks you for information about ClearFit.com or the ClearFit Program.

### * Spreading the Word!

Email is the fastest and easiest way to tell your friends, family, business and other acquaintances about ClearFit.com and the ClearFit Program, however, you can also use old-fashioned word-of mouth to tell your friends about us. When you visit the ClearFit Referral Center, you will be able to select a referral e-mail that you can personalize or forward as is to interested parties. In the e-mail, we include your User Name, identifying you as the referring party. When your friend enters your User Name when they sign up, you are automatically eligible for a referral bonus whenever they are hired successfully by a ClearFit company.

Please use the ClearFit Referral Program responsibly. We strictly enforce our Anti Spam Policy!
