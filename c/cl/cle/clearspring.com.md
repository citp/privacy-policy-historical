# Privacy Policy - Clearspring

### Our Commitment to Privacy

Clearspring Technologies ("Clearspring", "we" or "our") has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information about users of Clearspring.com (the "Site"). Our commitment to you is that we will not disclose information collected from you other than as described in this policy. The following discloses in detail our information collection, utilization and dissemination practices of information collected through our Site. 

**Our Privacy Policy in short:**

  * We will only use personal information you provide us according to the terms outlined in this document.
  * In order to utilize the features and services offered through this Site, you must provide a limited amount of information; however, we will not disclose.
  * We will never provide personally identifiable information about you to third parties without your consent.



**What information do we collect?**

During general use of the Site or as otherwise identified below, we collect personal, demographic and preference information, email address, usage data and other personally identifiable information ("Personal Data") from all users or visitors to the Site and users of the Site. All users must agree to the applicable Terms of Service posted on the Site. 

In addition, we collect certain information, which cannot be used to personally identify any user, and which may be provided to third parties, such as auditors . Such non-personal data ordinarily includes aggregate, summary, or other usage data, and may include, by way of example, statistics regarding total users, information regarding types of Internet browsers used by users, and widget usage patterns. We also collect non-personal data about each users IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Site. 

When using the Site, we may create "cookies" on your computer for purposes of facilitating and maintaining your current user session, and may collect personal data using those cookies in order to enable us to identify you in connection with the Site and to track use of the Site for purposes consistent with this policy. 

Any user providing personal data is certifying that he/she is over the age of 13. As such, we do not collect or maintain personal data from individuals we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site is designed to attract people under 13. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. Thus, if we ever obtain knowledge that that a user is under 13, we will take steps to remove that user's personal data from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Site. 

**How do we use and disclose collected information?**

We track product usage data and user traffic patterns throughout our site to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service. 

We do not share personal information collected on this web site with third parties for their direct marketing. We do not share personal information about site users with third parties unless doing so is appropriate to carry out a user's request or it reasonably believes that doing so is legally required or is in Clearspring's interest to protect its property or other legal rights or the rights or property of others. 

**Accessing your personal data.**

Each user selects a unique username and password that enables their access to the Site. Users may access their account profiles at any time to update personal data contained within that account profile. Subsequent uses or disclosures of information by us will reflect those changes. Certain information is necessary in order for us to provide the services; therefore, if you delete such necessary information you will not be able to use the Site 

**Our commitment to data security.**

Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information in our possession and control, no security system can prevent against all potential security breaches, and we bear no liability for uses or disclosures of personal data or non-personal data arising in connection with the theft thereof. Likewise, you are responsible for safeguarding the confidentiality of passwords to the Site, and we bear no liability for access to, or use or disclosure of personal data if such access, use or disclosure arises in connection with the theft or disclosure (whether intentional or negligent) of such user's password. 

**Changes to this policy.**

If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on the Site so that users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we will disclose it. Any such posted changes will be effective upon the date indicated by the posting. Your continued access to and/or use of the Site or our services constitutes your assent to, and acceptance of, this policy, including all posted changes for which we have provided notice.
