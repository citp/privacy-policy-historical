			<p>
			At Clear Books we recognise the importance of your privacy. This policy outlines the information we collect, how we use it and how we safeguard your information.</p>
		
			<p>
			Clear Books may be required to revise this Privacy Policy in the future to comply with any applicable European regulations, in order to utilise new technologies or to improve your Clear Books experience, so please check back periodically.
			</p>
			<p>	

			</p><p>
			This Privacy Policy forms part of, and should be read in conjuction with, our Terms and Conditions. Please <a href="/static/terms/">click here</a> to access our Terms and Conditions.
			</p>	
		
			<h2>When you access Clear Books</h2>
		
			<p>
			Clear Books uses <a href="/static/privacy-terms/">cookies</a> to store and collect information about your usage of the Website in order to enhance your online experience and to help us improve the quality of our services.

			<p>
			Your personal details will never be passed on to any other companies or third parties including affiliates and will never be added to any third party mailing lists or databases.
			</p>
			<p>
			Clear Books collects <a href="/static/privacy-terms/">personal information</a> when you register on the Website. Your information will be stored confidentially by us and only used by Clear Books in order to provide you with access to our products, services and information that we believe will interest you.
			</p>
			<p>

			<h2>Your preferences and the Fubra Passport</h2>
		
			<p>
			Clear Books uses the Fubra Passport to manage the user log in process. Fubra Limited operates various other popular websites managing them via a central login system called the Fubra Passport. This system is a database of the users who can access Fubra websites and also contains a set of preferences for each subscriber.
			</p>
			<p>
			When you sign up to a Fubra partner website, such as Clear Books, a Fubra Passport account is opened for you and you can use this to access the content on any of the Fubra websites.
			</p>
			<p>
			As Fubra are usually providing expensive data sets to consumers free of charge, its aim has been to establish a database of subscribers who Fubra can communicate with when new features are added to current websites or when a new website is launched. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The data held in the Fubra Passport system is not available for sale to any third parties and will only ever be used with your consent.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you would prefer not to receive alerts about Clear Books then you can manage your alerts on the My Alerts page.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you remove all your alerts then Fubra will no longer send you any automatic update emails. However you will still remain a subscriber to Fubra websites via the Fubra Passport system and will therefore still have access to Fubra websites when you choose to search for information.
			</p>
			<p>
			As a subscriber of the Fubra Passport, Fubra will occasionally email you with news and information about the company, new website features and new websites. If you do not wish to receive any emails from Fubra, you must cancel your subscription to the Fubra Passport login system.
			</p>
			<p>
			Please note once you have done this you will no longer be able to log in to any Fubra websites without re-subscribing.
			</p>
			<p>
			You can use the Fubra Passport page to join or leave any of Fubra website that is currently supported by the system. By leaving just one website you will continue to receive emails about other websites if you remain a member of those.
			</p>
