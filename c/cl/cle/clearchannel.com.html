		<td align="left" class="style5"><p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Privacy Statement</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This statement informs you of Clear Channel’s practices with respect to the online collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from this Clear Channel Website. Personal information is information that allows us to contact you (such as email address, home address, or telephone number) or other information that, when linked to your name or contact information, allows us to personalize your visit to our site by providing you with information that suits your interests. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clear Channel is the owner of this website and retains all ownership rights to the information collected at this site. Clear Channel reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of this Privacy Statement. Any changes to this Privacy Statement will be posted here, and we encourage you to check back from time to time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Personalization</span><br>Although you may use many features of this site without completing a registration or sign-up form, visitors who do register and/or sign up for special services may have access to additional features of the site and are more likely to receive information suited to their interests. For example, a registered user is eligible for additional services provided by this website such as listener clubs and personalized content. Our registration and special services sign-up forms may ask you for contact information (like name or email address) and demographic information (like zip code or age). You must provide the information in order to receive the benefits of registration or of the special service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may use the contact information you give us to better tailor your website experience to your interests, and to send you information about Clear Channel and its services as well as promotional material on behalf of some of our partners. We use other information that you provide to us to show you content in which you may be interested and to display the content according to your preferences. We will also share this information within the Clear Channel family in order to enhance your experience on this and other Clear Channel Websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, we may share this information with advertisers or other third parties that are not part of the Clear Channel family on an aggregate or other basis that does not disclose your identity or contact information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Online Surveys/Contests<br></span>From time to time, we may conduct online surveys and contests. These ask you for contact information (like name or email address) and demographic information (like zip code or age). We may use this contact information from our surveys and contests to provide you with information about our company and promotional material on behalf of some of our partners, and to contact you when necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Supplemental Information <br></span>To enhance Clear Channel’s ability to tailor this site to your preferences, we may combine information that you provide us on registration and other online sign-up forms with other information about you that we may obtain. We do not share that information with any other party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Shopping/Commercial Services</span><br>This Clear Channel site may offer shopping services, which may be offered by us or by a firm that operates a store under contract with us. If our site offers shopping or other commercial services, you will use a customer order form to request information, products, and services. The order form will ask you to give us contact information (like name or email address), financial information (like account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like zip code or age).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will use the financial information that you provide to bill you for products and services. By giving our site your credit card and related personal information, you are authorizing our store to give that information to the merchant and credit card company in order to confirm and fulfill your order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will use contact information from the order form to fulfill your orders. We may also use contact data to get in touch with you when necessary. We will not otherwise use or distribute your financial information without your prior approval.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Public Forums</span><br>This site may make available chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups. Please remember that any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Information Sharing With Third Parties<br></span>From time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by Clear Channel to provide additional features at this site. These special relationships may include “powered by” partners, business partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as “co-branded pages”). These might include, for example, pages that share our name and that of another entity, such as TicketMaster. You should look for a specific privacy statement on any such co-branded page. Any personal information that you provide when signing up at one of those co-branded pages may be shared with our third party partner. You should also check our partner’s website for information regarding its privacy policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the nature of some features of our site may require that we share personal information about you with persons or companies outside of the Clear Channel family. For example, this may occur at a feature that enables you, via our site, to ask questions of persons or entities that are not part of the Clear Channel family. By responding to those features of the site, whether by email or direct entry of information on our Website, you are consenting to our transferring that information to such persons or entities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With respect to specific registration modules, like contests, we may disclose personal information collected, and we will post a conspicuous statement on the registration module to the effect that we will be disclosing the information collected with third parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, we may share any of the information collected from you with these other non-Clear Channel companies in an aggregate basis. The aggregated information is not linked to any information that can identify you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">IP Address and Log Files</span><br>We may use your IP address to administer our Website, to help diagnose problems with our server, to analyze trends, to track users’ webpage movements, to help identify you and your shopping cart, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Cookies</span><br>This Clear Channel site may use a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how you use the site. Cookies reside on your computer and help our website to recognize your computer’s browser as a previous visitor. This information allows us to customize delivery of information. For example, our site may use cookies to save and remember registration information or preferences that you may have set while browsing the site, to keep track of your shopping cart, to ensure you don’t see the same ad content repeatedly, to deliver content specific to your interests, and to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. We use cookies only to gather information as indicated in this policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, on occasion our site may also set a “session cookie” which helps us administer the site. The session cookie expires when you close your browser and does not retain any information about you after it expires. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, we may also use an ad network provider to help present advertisements on this and other Clear Channel Web sites.&nbsp; This ad network provider, like other advertising service vendors, uses cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on the hard drive of your computer to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, and to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements.&nbsp; In doing so, the provider collects non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data.&nbsp; The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours.&nbsp; If you do not want the benefits of these advertising cookies, you may opt-out by visiting <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>.&nbsp; However, if you do so you may not receive the full benefit from the use of our site</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Banner Advertising</span><br>We license ad-server software from another company to place banner advertising on our sites. All of the data provided and generated by the ad-server software remains in our possession and no data is transferred to the licensor of the software. This feature of our site may, on occasion, set “cookies” on your computer. Any information collected or stored by the ad-service or the cookies is treated in the same manner as other information as described in this statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Children’s Personal Information</span></p>
<p>Consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act:</p>
<p>This site does NOT collect, use, or disclose personal information (including online contact information) of children under the age of 13. <br>In the event that a child under the age of 13 attempts to register on our site, we will NOT accept the registration and will delete information received from the child. </p>
<p><br>In the event that a child posts personal information in a public forum such as a chat room, we will attempt to delete that information once we become aware of it.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Your Choices</span><br>This Clear Channel site provides you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving email communications from us and our special relationship partners. To opt-out of receiving email communications, you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modify your registered user information on our website; or <br>Send an email to Clear Channel Radio Interactive Support. Please include the web address, call letters or station's name. (Please note that this email address should only be used for specific technical issues related to the website such as unsubscribing from a database. The recipients of these emails will not be able, in general to answer concerns regarding on-air programming, promotions or other non-web related issues.)<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Access to Personal Information</span><br>Clear Channel gives you the opportunity to modify or remove personal information that you have provided to us. You may do so by modifying your password-protected registered user information on our website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Security of Your Personal Information</span><br>Clear Channel employs reasonable security measures consistent with standard industry practice, for information collected through this website. We believe that we have adequate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information we collect on our website. We also use internal protections to limit access to users’ personal information to only those employees who need the information to perform a specific job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Sale or Merger</span><br>If this site is sold to, or merges with, another company not owned by Clear Channel, you should expect that some or all of the information collected from this website may be transferred to the buyer/surviving company. If so, Clear Channel will seek to obligate the acquiring company to use any personal information transferred by this site in a manner consistent with this statement, but cannot guarantee that it will be able to impose that requirement or that the acquiring company will comply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Legal Process</span><br>You should be aware that Clear Channel may be required to disclose your personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, such as in court or regulatory proceedings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Contacting the Website</span><br>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this website, you can contact Clear Channel Radio Interactive Support. Please include the web address, call letters or station's name. Please note that this email address should only be used for specific technical issues related to the website such as unsubscribing from a database. The recipients of these emails will not be able, in general to answer concerns regarding on-air programming, promotions or other non-web related issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Leased Content</span><br>Neither Standard &amp; Poor nor any third-party licensor shall have any liability for the accuracy or completeness of this service or any component thereof or for delays, unauthenticity, omissions, or other defects therein nor for any claims or losses arising therefrom or occasioned thereby, including, without limitation, any lost profits, indirect, special, or consequential damages. Either Standard &amp; Poor or third party licensors have exclusive proprietary rights from the information received via the service. Customer, end-user, or visitor, as applicable, shall not use or permit anyone to use the information provided through the service for any unlawful or unauthorized purpose. Customer, end-user, or visitor, as applicable, is not authorized or permitted to furnish such information to any person or firm for reuse or retransmission without prior written approval of the source of such information. Provision of the information on the service is subject to termination in the event that any agreement between a third party licensor and a provider of information distributed through the service is terminated in accordance with its terms. Third party licensor and its subsidiaries, affiliates, information providers and content partners shall have no liability for investment decisions based on the information provided hereby. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">General Information</span><br>This Agreement and the Additional Terms shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, as it is applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within such state, without regard to conflict of law principles. You agree that any cause of action you or Clear Channel brings to enforce this Agreement and/or the Additional Terms, or in connection with any matters related to this Clear Channel Website and/or the Privacy Statement, shall be brought only in either the state or Federal courts located in San Antonio, Texas.

You agree to file any cause of action with respect to this Agreement within one year after the cause of action arises. You agree that a cause of action filed after this date is barred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid or for any reason, unenforceable including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, then such provision shall be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that matches, as closely as possible, the original provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The failure of either party to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Unless expressly provided otherwise, this Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Clear Channel with respect to the use of this Clear Channel Website and shall not be modified except in writing, signed by an authorized representative of Clear Channel.</p>
