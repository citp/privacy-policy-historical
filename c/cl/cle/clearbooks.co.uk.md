### Your preferences and the Fubra Passport

Clear Books uses the Fubra Passport to manage the user log in process. Fubra Limited operates various other popular websites managing them via a central login system called the Fubra Passport. This system is a database of the users who can access Fubra websites and also contains a set of preferences for each subscriber.

When you sign up to a Fubra partner website, such as Clear Books, a Fubra Passport account is opened for you and you can use this to access the content on any of the Fubra websites.

As Fubra are usually providing expensive data sets to consumers free of charge, its aim has been to establish a database of subscribers who Fubra can communicate with when new features are added to current websites or when a new website is launched.

The data held in the Fubra Passport system is not available for sale to any third parties and will only ever be used with your consent.

If you would prefer not to receive alerts about Clear Books then you can manage your alerts on the My Alerts page.

If you remove all your alerts then Fubra will no longer send you any automatic update emails. However you will still remain a subscriber to Fubra websites via the Fubra Passport system and will therefore still have access to Fubra websites when you choose to search for information.

As a subscriber of the Fubra Passport, Fubra will occasionally email you with news and information about the company, new website features and new websites. If you do not wish to receive any emails from Fubra, you must cancel your subscription to the Fubra Passport login system.

Please note once you have done this you will no longer be able to log in to any Fubra websites without re-subscribing.

You can use the Fubra Passport page to join or leave any of Fubra website that is currently supported by the system. By leaving just one website you will continue to receive emails about other websites if you remain a member of those.

### What is Personal Information?

Personal information is information you provide to us which personally identifies you including your name, address and e-mail address.

### What is Non Personal Information?

Non personal information is collected and recorded about users when they use the Website. This information is collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or represents any individual user and is used purely for statistical purposes.

### What is an IP address?

Each Internet connection is identified by a unique address which is referred to as an IP address (Internet Protocol address).

An IP address is made up of four numbers, separated by dots, for example: 87.124.10.1. This address allows any website visitor to be identified with the co-operation of the relevant Internet Service Provider (ISP). In practice an ISP would not give out this information because they would be in breach of the Data Protection Act. You should be aware that it is technically possible to connect an IP with a user with the help of a court order and the relevant ISP.

Some ISPs publish the name of the company or individual who uses the connection which allows anyone to see who is using that IP from central registries held by R.I.P.E. and other Regional Internet Registries (RIR). You can check if your IP address is listed using the whois service provided by all RIRs.
