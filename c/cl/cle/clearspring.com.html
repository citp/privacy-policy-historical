<p>
    Welcome to <strong>www.clearspring.com</strong> (the "<strong>Site</strong>"), a website operated by Clearspring Technologies, Inc. 
    ("<strong>Clearspring</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", or "<strong>our</strong>").  
    We provide our users (collectively, "<strong>you</strong>" or "<strong>your</strong>") with resources and information about the AddThis content sharing platform, as well 
    as a number of related services (collectively, the "<strong>Services</strong>").  We know you are concerned about your privacy, so we developed this 
    privacy policy ("<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>") to explain how we collect, use, and disclose information from and/or about you.   This Privacy Policy 
    does not apply to any information submitted on AddThis.com or through the services provided on or through AddThis.com. <a href="http://www.addthis.com/privacy">More information 
    about privacy and AddThis</a>.
</p>


<p>
    YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) 
    WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.  BY USING THIS SITE AND PROVIDING 
    ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE TRANSFER OF DATA FROM YOUR COUNTRY TO A COUNTRY THAT HAS LESS STRINGENT LAWS, AND THE 
    PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CONFORMANCE WITH THIS POLICY.
</p>
<p>
    So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase "<strong>Personal Information</strong>" in this Privacy Policy, we mean your 
    contact information (e.g., your name, address, email address, or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is associated with your contact information. 
    "When we use the phrase "<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>" in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information. 
    Anonymous Information does not enable identification of or contact with individual persons.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Advertising Choices</strong><br>
We believe that delivering targeted and relevant advertising enhances your internet experience. We collect non-personally identifiable information and use that information to deliver
targeted advertising on many of the websites you may visit.  If you prefer that we do not collect non-personally identifiable information about your website visits for the purpose of delivering
targeted advertising, you may opt out by <a href="/legal/advertising-choices">clicking here</a>. </p>

<p>When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out cookie tells us not to use your information for delivering relevant online advertisements. Please note that if you
delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Children.</strong><br>
    The Site is not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Services.  Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us.  We do not collect 
    or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 18 years of age, and no part of our Site or Services is designed to attract people under 18 years 
    of age. If we later learn that a User is under 18 years of age, we will take steps to remove that User's Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the User 
    from utilizing the Site and the Services.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>How We Collect Information.</strong><br>
    <u>Personal Information</u><br>
    In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Services to you and helps us learn more about the use of the Site and/or Services.  We collect 
    Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily. For example, to receive product notifications from us, you must provide your email address. To leave comments on 
    our Site, we require you to provide your name and email address, as well as additional optional information. When you communicate with us through our Site or by sending 
    us an email, we may collect and store any information that is contained in your communications with us.  You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but

    of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed. "<strong>Cookies</strong>" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your 
    browser while you are viewing a website.  We use session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) but we do not currently use persistent Cookies.  You can 
    instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, 
    however, you may not be able to use all portions or functionalities of the Site or Services.
