## Social Plugins

CleverReach uses “social plugins” by Facebook such as the “Recommend” or “Like” buttons on the CleverReach website as well as in CleverReach products. These plugins are provided by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA and either have the Facebook logo or a “thumbs up” symbol. If you open a website by CleverReach that contains such a plugin, your browser will establish a connection to the Facebook servers. Facebook sends the content of the plugin directly to your web browser and displays it accordingly on CleverReach websites. CleverReach has no control over the content of the plugins.

With the transfer of data Facebook might be able to trace your visit on our website and associate it with your Facebook account if you are a Facebook user or if you recently visited either a Facebook website or a website with content by Facebook. If you actively use those plugins, for example by clicking on a Recommend or Like button, information on this will be sent directly from your browser to Facebook, without CleverReach having any control over this. For information on what data is collected and sent to Facebook or what happens to that data, please visit Facebook’s Privacy Policy (<http://www.facebook.com/policy.php>) which provides information on your rights in this respect and allows you to adjust your privacy settings on Facebook.

If you wish to prevent Facebook from collecting information while you are visiting our websites or using our software, log off Facebook before visiting our website or using CleverReach software. You should also make sure that any Facebook cookies are deleted from your browser.

## The Google +1 Button

In addition to social plug-ins by other providers, we also use the +1 button by Google.com, which is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. This button can be found at the bottom of each page and is marked by the “+1” logo. 

When a page on our website is accessed, the browser establishes a direct connection with Google’s servers, allowing the button to be transmitted to the browser and displayed on our website. Via the button, Google receives the information that this specific page of our internet presence was accessed. If you are logged in to your Google account at the time of the visit, Google is able to associate that visit with you. If you then click on the +1 button, this information is sent to Google directly and will be saved in your user account. 

For information about the purpose and the scope of the data collection as well as the further use of data by Google, please see Google’s privacy policy. There you can also find out how to change this to protect your privacy. If you do not agree with the submission of your data to Google, log out of your Google account before visiting our websites.
