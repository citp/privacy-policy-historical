  <h1>Censys Privacy Policy</h1>
  <hr>

  <p><b>Effective Date of Privacy Policy:</b> January 19, 2018.</p>

  <p>The Censys Team at ZCorp Technology, Inc. ("we", "our" or "us") values
  your privacy, and we appreciate that many of your interactions with Censys
  products and services on <a href="https://censys.io">https://censys.io</a>
  (the "Site") (collectively with the Site, "Censys") involve sensitive data,
  including personally identifiable information ("Personal Information"). We
  are committed to being transparent about our privacy practices. This privacy
  policy broadly describes the Personal Information we collect and what we do
  with this data. When you use Censys, you're consenting to the collection and
  use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy, so please make
  sure you review its terms carefully.</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy doesn't apply to the practices of third parties
  ("Third Party Services") that you opt to access through Censys. While we try
  to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our
  respect for your privacy, we are in no way responsible for Third Party
  Services and encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any
  Third Party Services you access.</p>

  <h2>What information do we collect?</h2><hr>

  <p>When you use Censys, we collect information about you and your actions on the Site. This includes:</p>
  <ol>

	  <li><b>Your IP address:</b> we automatically receive and record information from
		  your web browser when you interact with Censys, including your IP
		  address. This information is used to prevent abuse and also to
		  facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with Censys
		  (e.g., what links you have clicked on). We may collect some
		  device-specific information if you access Censys using a mobile
		  device. Device information may include but is not limited to unique
		  device identifiers, network information, and hardware model, as well
		  as information about how the device interacts with Censys.</li>

	  <li><b>Personal Information:</b> by creating an Account and providing Personal
		  Information to us, such as the name and contact information you
		  provide when you establish a Censys account ("Account"), you allow us
		  to identify you and therefore may not be anonymous. To make things
		  easier for our users, you may be able to use your account credentials
		  with Third Party Services (e.g. Google) to sign in to Censys. By
		  doing so, you acknowledge that some third party account information
		  may be transmitted into your Account with us, and that such third
		  party account information transmitted to Censys is covered by this
		  Privacy Policy. The Third Party Service may be collecting information
		  about your browser or online activity through its own tracking
		  technologies and subject to its own privacy policy.</li>

	  <li><b>Logs of your search queries and other interactions with our servers:</b>
		  all content submitted by you to Censys may be retained by us
		  indefinitely. Please note that if you terminate your Account, any
		  association between your Account and information we store will no
		  longer be accessible through your Account but may remain stored on
		  our servers. We may continue to disclose such content to third
		  parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as
		  described in this Privacy Policy.</li>

	  <li><b>Cookies:</b> When you use the Site, we set a first-party cookie to
		  uniquely identify your browser software over time on our site, and
		  this cookie is recorded in our logs. Most browsers have an option for
		  turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from
		  accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of
		  your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each
		  new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave
		  cookies active; turning off the cookie feature may stop you from
		  using some Censys products and services. This Privacy Policy covers
		  our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by
		  third parties. We don't control when or how third parties place
		  cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which
		  a link on the Site points may set cookies on your computer.</li>

	  <li><b>Email communications:</b> We may receive a confirmation when you
		  open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our
		  service.</li>

	  <li><b>Location information:</b> Some of our Services may include features based
		on users' actual locations and may report on users' current locations
		("Location-Based Services"). To the extent you voluntarily opt to use
		any Location-Based Services, we may collect and store information about
		your location at the time you use those Location-Based Services. This
		information can come from a variety of sources depending on the client
		you use to access the Services; for example, a mobile phone may report
		its GPS location at the time Location-Based Services are used.</li>

  </ol><br>

  <p>In addition, we use third-party service providers and hosting providers who collect data on our behalf:</p>

  <ol>

	  <li>We use a variety of third-party analytics services, including, but
		  not limited to, Segment, Intercom, and Google Analytics, to measure
		  user engagement with our products. These services record data about
		  how you use our services, and Intercom reports to us when you open
		  messages we send.</li>

	  <li>We use Google Cloud to host parts of our servers. Google Cloud
		  maintains additional logs of your computer's interaction with its
		  servers.</li>

	  <li>We use Stripe to process payments. However, we do not receive your
		  credit card information; use and storage of that information is
		  governed by Stripe's terms of service and privacy policy located at
		  <a href="https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal">https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal</a>.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>Your interactions with these third-party service providers will be
  governed by their privacy policies.  Your participation and interaction with
  Censys on third-party social media sites will be governed by the relevant
  vendors' privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>What We Share</h2><hr>

  <p>We use the information we collect (either ourselves or through third-party
  services) to improve our service offerings, troubleshoot system issues,
  prevent abuse, and develop new features. We will sometimes use your contact
  information to send you information about our products and services, but we
  will not sell it to third parties for marketing.</p>

  <p>We may share information we collect with our authorized third-party
  vendors, consultants, and service providers who perform services for Censys.
  These third-parties may only use or disclose information about you to perform
  services on Censys' behalf, to comply with legal obligations, or as described
  in their privacy policies.</p>

  <p>If we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired, or if we go out
  of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets
  that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
  transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue
  to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>

  <p>We reserve the right to access, read, preserve and disclose any information
  about you if we reasonably believe it is necessary:</p>
  <ol type="i">
	  <li>to comply with any
		  applicable law, regulation, governmental request or legal process,
		  to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or as
		  may be required for the purposes of national security;</li>
	  <li>to protect our
  rights or property, or to prevent physical, mental, financial or other harm,
  injury or loss to us, our users or the public;</li>
	  <li>to detect, investigate,
  prevent, or otherwise address suspect or actual illegal or inappropriate
  activity or exposure to liability, including fraud, security or technical
  issues (which includes exchanging information with other companies and
  organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention);</li>
  <li>to
  enforce this Privacy Policy and our <a href="/tos">Terms of Service</a> and any other agreements
  between us, including investigation of potential violations of the same, or</li>
  <li>to respond to user support requests.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>We reserve the right, solely at our
  discretion, to object to certain information disclosure requests that we
  believe to be improper.</p>

  <p><b>California Privacy Right:</b> Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents
are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information which we
share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information
for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this
notice, please submit a written request to the following address: 2531 Jackson Ave #106 Ann Arbor,
MI 48103.</p>

  <h2>Information Security</h2><hr>

  <p>We seek to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept private;
  however, we cannot guarantee the security of any Account information.
  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors,
  may compromise the security of user information at any time. We otherwise
  store all of our information, including your IP address information, using
  industry-standard techniques.  We do not guarantee or warrant that such
  techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we
  store, Personal Information or otherwise.</p>

  <h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2><hr>

	<p>We may need to revise our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make
	changes, we will post the most-up-to-date version at <a href="https://censys.io/privacy">https://censys.io/privacy</a>. To
 facilitate easier review, we will update the policy version and effective date
 on that page. If we make major changes, we will notify registered users by
 email. Your continued use of Censys after the effective date of such changes
 constitutes your acceptance of such changes.</p>

	<h2>Contact Us</h2><hr>

	<p>If you have any questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact
	us by email at <a href="mailto:legal@censys.io">legal@censys.io</a>.</p>
