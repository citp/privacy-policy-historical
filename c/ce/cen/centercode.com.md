# Centercode Privacy Policy | Centercode

We take the privacy of our visitors, testers, and customers very seriously. Below are the details of our web site's privacy policy. Please email [security@centercode.com](mailto:security@centercode.com) with any questions.

Centercode respects the privacy of anyone who uses the Centercode Web site (www.centercode.com) and Centercode Connect™ online application. Centercode gathers important information from our visitors and customers. We publish this Privacy Policy to communicate how we gather and use information about you, how we protect it, and how you can participate in its protection.

Centercode provides its service to you subject to the Centercode Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy, which shall be deemed part of the Terms of Service. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy. If we change it, we will provide notification of the change at least thirty (30) business days before the change takes effect and include directions for how you can respond to the change. 

### Safe Harbor

Consistent with its commitment to protect personal privacy, Centercode complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

Centercode has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Centercode's certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

### Information Collected

We require people who register to use the Centercode online applications (the "Services") to give us contact information. Depending on the services chosen, we ask for contact and account information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, e-mail address, password, and the number of users in the organization who will be using the Services, in addition to financial and billing information, such as billing name, address and credit card number. When you express interest in additional information, when you register for the Services, or after you become a user, we may ask for additional personal information, such as title, department name, fax number, number of employees, or industry. You can opt out of providing additional information by not entering it when asked. Centercode does not distribute or share customer e-mail addresses, except as noted in its Terms of Service, or as may be required by law. 

Centercode uses the information we collect to set up the Services for individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information to contact customers and prospects to further discuss their interest in our company, the Services we provide and ways we can improve them, and to send information such as announcements of promotions and events regarding our company or partners. We may also e-mail a customer newsletter and updates about the Services or the company. You can opt out of receiving these communications by replying to them at the time they are distributed or at any time by e-mailing [security@centercode.com](mailto:security@centercode.com).

All financial and billing information that we collect through the centercode.com Web site and the Services is used solely to bill for the Services. Centercode does not use this billing information for marketing or promotional purposes. Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as provided for in the Centercode Terms of Service, we do not disclose to any third party the information provided.

Centercode has referral relationships with third-party companies and individuals ("Referral Partners") who refer their customers to the Centercode Services. Customers who become paying users of the Centercode Services through a Referral Partner are considered customers of both Centercode and the Referral Partner. Centercode and a Referral Partner may share customer contact as well as account, financial and billing information with respect to their joint business relationship with the customer. The sharing of this information allows Centercode and the Referral Partner to establish the identity of the shared customer and determine referral fees owed. This sharing also allows Referral Partners to provide consolidated billing services to the shared customer. Shared contact and account, financial and billing information is governed by the Centercode Terms of Service. Centercode does not share your business data with Referral Partners. 

Centercode uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing. 

Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide information on the Web site, but they are not permitted to collect any information, nor does Centercode share any personally identifiable user information with these parties. 

Centercode customers use the Centercode Services to host data and information. Centercode will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such data except as provided in the Centercode Terms of Service, or as may be required by law. We will view or access individual records only with your permission (for example, to resolve a problem or support issue). Of course, users of the Services are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and passwords. 

Centercode may also collect certain information from visitors to the Web site and customers of the Services, such as Internet addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems and to administer the Centercode Web site and Services in order to constantly improve quality. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties. 

### Security

Centercode has security measures in place for Centercode Services to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the data under Centercode's control. When the Services are accessed using common web browsers (e.g. Chrome, IE7+, Firefox, Safari, etc), Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure data is safe, secure and available only to you. Centercode also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications and hosts the Services in a secure server environment using a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, Centercode requires unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of data. 

### Third Party Sites

The Centercode Services and Web site contain links to other Web sites. Centercode is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other Web sites. Customers and visitors must check the policy statement of these others Web sites to understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information. It is your responsibility to keep such information private and confidential

### Cookies

Cookies are files Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive. They are used to help us authenticate clients and provide time-saving shortcuts and preferences. Centercode uses a persistent encrypted cookie, if the client requests, to save and retrieve individual authentication information as well as other per-client device preferences. When a visitor follows a link to the Centercode Web site from an affiliate or promotion, Centercode stores information about that affiliate or promotion in a session cookie. Acceptance of these cookies is optional. Centercode issues a mandatory session cookie to each user of the Services only to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session. If you reject this cookie, access to and usage of the Services will be denied.

### Opt-Out Policy

Centercode offers you a means to choose how we may use information you provided. If, at any time after registering for information or ordering the Services, you change your mind about receiving information from us or about sharing information with third parties, send us a request specifying your new choice. Send your request to [security@centercode.com](mailto:security@centercode.com). 

### Enforcement and Dispute Resolution

Centercode utilizes the self-assessment approach to assure its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Centercode periodically verifies that this Privacy Policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented, and in conformity with the Safe Harbor Principles.

Centercode encourages interested persons to raise any concerns about its implementation of this Privacy Policy using the contact information below. Centercode will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this Privacy Policy.

Centercode has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the ICDR/AAA (International Centre for Dispute Resolution – a Division of the American Arbitration Association). If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Centercode, please visit the ICDR/AAA web site at <http://go.adr.org/safeharbor> for more information and to file a complaint.

Centercode is also subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
