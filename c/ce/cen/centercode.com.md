# Centercode Privacy Policy | Centercode

Effective May 25th, 2018

## Introduction

The following is intended to explain how Centercode uses this website, and any information we collect, to market and sell our products, and to explain the tools, services, and technologies we leverage to do so. Above all, our goal is to always be responsible in how we collect, store, and use your information, while complying with all relevant regulations.

To simplify this for our audience, we’ve split our policy into two parts. The first section is intended to provide a walk-through of the primary ways we handle your data. These are the things that we feel are most interesting to the majority of our audience. The second section provides the comprehensive details.

Regardless, we comply with and are passionate about this entire policy, and would encourage you to take your time in reviewing it. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us at [privacy@centercode.com](mailto:privacy@centercode.com).

### Intended Audiences

The primary audience of this website is businesses interested in learning more about Centercode and its offerings. The secondary audiences are individuals seeking employment at Centercode, vendors, and others seeking to have a business relationship with us.

If you’re not with a business, or looking for a job, but rather are an individual interested in testing new products, you should instead visit our [Betabound](https://betabound.com/) portal (which has its own [Privacy Policy](https://betabound.com/privacy)). Betabound is always looking for enthusiastic testers.

Alternatively, if you’re a company actively using the Centercode Platform or our services, or are a user of such a company, please see our [Customer Data Handling Policies](https://web.archive.org/customer-data/).

## Data Handling Overview

The following explains how your data is handled as you navigate and interact with Centercode and our website.

### Visitor Tracking

When you visit our website, your activity as you navigate is tracked by [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) and [Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/) via cookies. Google Analytics lets us study aggregated (or de-identified) data about our traffic patterns in order to improve our site design and the information we offer. Marketo tracks your ongoing activity on our site. If at some point you choose to provide information to us that reveals your identity, then your prior activity will be matched to your new record in Marketo. This is intended to help us to prioritize our efforts by focusing on our most engaged visitors.

### Gated Content

We offer significant industry and educational resources on our site. These include things like [white papers, ebooks, and recorded webinars](https://web.archive.org/library/), and are typically “gated”, meaning we require information from you in order to download them. Our goal in investing significant resources in developing these valuable materials is to create an opportunity to learn about you and begin building a relationship. To achieve this goal, we use Marketo to collect your full name and job title, email address, phone number, company name and size, and the intent of your download (e.g. researching vs. interested in purchasing).

We use this information to determine your likely interest in our offerings. If we feel we’re a fit, the information we collected is sent to our CRM System ([Insightly](https://insightly.com/)). We use [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) to make this transfer, and leverage a platform known as [Clearbit](https://clearbit.com/) to enrich this data, reducing what we need to ask of you directly.

If we feel you’re an ideal prospect, a member of our internal account team will study your company and reach out to attempt to continue to build a relationship with you, in the hope that there will be an opportunity to work together. Our team is not pushy, and are trained to be as consultative as possible. If you ask that they stop contacting you, they’ll politely and immediately respect your wishes, and follow an internal process to remove your data.

By downloading our gated content, you’ll likely receive marketing email from us, such as future content and webinar announcements. We consider your attention limited and time valuable, and therefore deliberately limit our outreach. In addition, every email will include a very simple opt-out mechanism, which will remove you from future outreach.

### Other Web Site Activities

Beyond downloading content, there are a few other ways to engage with us that do collect personal or use information.

  * **In-Site Chat** – You’ll notice a small circle in the bottom right of our site. This allows you to communicate with us in real-time via [Intercom](https://intercom.com/). While you don’t need to provide any personal information to use our real-time chat (and we don’t send information to it), your email will be requested if we’re not actively available, so that we can get back to you. 
  * **Webinar Registration** – If you happen to participate in any of our webinars, the [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) platform will collect basic contact information in order to access our live webinar event. Recorded webinars do not require interacting with Zoom. 
  * **Event Registration** – If you register to attend one of our live events (e.g. Conference, Roadshows), your contact information will be collected and stored on the [Bizzabo](https://bizzabo.com/) events management platform. 
  * **Meeting Scheduling** – If you schedule a meeting with our team, we’ll collect basic contact information and schedule preferences via the [YouCanBookMe](https://youcanbook.me/) platform. Alternatively, our sales team uses [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) for individual meeting scheduling. 
  * **Email, Calendar, and Drive** – Our back-office productivity platform is the business version of [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/) , including Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive. If we interact with you directly, these email and calendar details will be stored by Google. 
  * **Job Applications** – If you apply for a job on our site, you’ll be asked to provide information relevant to the position via to the [JazzHR](https://jazzhr.com/) Applicant Tracking system. We use this platform for all applicant communication and scheduling. 



Where relevant, these systems typically feed information to or from Marketo (for marketing automation) and Insightly (for CRM), which are our primary marketing and sales platforms. Our goal is to always centralize information as much as possible, but in every case, **we manage your data, know where it is, and how to delete it.**

Finally, it’s important to understand that we only use your information for our own purposes. **We never sell your information, and none of the systems or partners that we leverage have that right.**

## Detailed Policy

This policy describes how Centercode collects, uses, and discloses information, and the choices you have about the information we collect. When we refer to **Centercode** , we mean **Centercode, Inc.** , a California corporation.

Centercode owns and operates the [Centercode.com](https://web.archive.org/) website and runs its business of providing [Customer Validation](https://web.archive.org/what-is-customer-validation/) services to businesses developing products based on its cloud-based software platform known as the [Centercode Platform](https://web.archive.org/software/).

Centercode also owns and operates [Betabound](https://betabound.com/), the web-based test participation portal known as Betabound, which we use to announce a wide variety of third-party Customer Validation opportunities, and to register and collect information about individuals interested in participating in Customer Validation tests. Our Betabound offerings are outside of the scope of this Centercode Privacy Policy (see Scope).

You should read this entire privacy policy. If you do not agree to its terms, you should not use our sites or services or submit personal information or other content to us. By using our sites or services and/or providing data to us you are accepting and agreeing to the practices outlined in this privacy policy.

## The Data We Collect and Receive

In order to operate and enable your use of the Centercode Sites, operate our business and services, and for other legitimate business interests described in this policy, we receive and collect certain information from you and about you, which includes **Personal Data**.

When we use the term **Personal Data** , we mean information that identifies an individual or that relates to an identified or identifiable individual (e.g. name, email address, phone number, location data, mailing address).

**By submitting or providing Personal Data or other information to us, you are representing that you have authority to do so and that we have full authorization to use this information in accordance with this privacy policy, even if the information relates to other individuals or entities.**

When you request more information or otherwise contact us through the Centercode Sites or otherwise (e.g. when you request a free trial or demo, register for a webinar, download content, complete a contact form, attend one of our events, interact through our social media pages, email, or call us), we may collect Personal Data such as your name, title, company name, job function, address, telephone number, email address, and other Personal Data and information that you voluntarily provide to us.

When customers establish services, we may collect, process, and use Personal Data such as name and address, company name and details, work contact information, financial, payment, and billing information, and other Personal Data and information that the customer voluntarily provides to us, such as when a customer contact completes a form or calls or submits an email to our sales, customer support, or services teams. We process this data through our trusted third-party service providers, including billing and credit card processing providers.

### Other Information

We may collect information from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, social media platforms, and from other third parties (such as Clearbit) in order to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing, offers, and content to you. The information we collect this way is from publicly accessible sources, such as business details and business contact information (e.g. your name, business email, address, and phone number, and job title), and social media handles.

### How We Share Data with Our Third-Party Service Providers and Partners

In addition, we use cloud hosting providers (such as Amazon Web Services and Rackspace), shipping providers (e.g. UPS, FedEx, USPS), and general office services such as email and file storage (e.g. Google). These third parties may have access to your data (including Personal Data) for the purpose of providing services to us and in compliance with our documented instructions. We diligently choose these third-party service providers, evaluate their privacy, security, and confidentiality practices, and enter into agreements with them specifying their obligations.

## Cookies, IP Addresses, and Other Passive Information Collected

This information is used to operate the Centercode Sites, to prevent fraud and misuse of our services, to measure how people use the Centercode Sites, to analyze how people respond to our emails and other communications, to analyze trends, to improve our services, and to improve your overall experience.

The information generated about your usage is transmitted to Google and is used to compile statistical reports on activity on the Centercode Sites to help us improve these sites and your experience.

For example, Marketo cookies let us know whether our emails have been opened, which links are clicked, and how many unique visitors we have.

This information generated about your usage is transmitted to Marketo in the United States. The information we receive from Marketo cookies and tracking technologies does not, standing alone, personally identify you. However, if you have chosen to identify yourself to us, such as by providing personal information when responding to a promotional offer, filling out a web form, or downloading content, we may re-associate this information with the personal information you have provided to us. We encourage you to read the [Marketo Privacy Policy](http://legal.marketo.com/privacy/).

We maintain a written security policy for the security, integrity, and protection of the Personal Data we hold against unauthorized disclosure or loss. We have put in place physical, technical, and organizational processes and measures designed to safeguard all Personal Data.

These safeguards help prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, the Personal Data that we hold. However, you should be aware that no security procedures or protocols are guaranteed to be 100% secure, and there is always some risk assumed when you share information.

If you have reason to believe that your Personal Data with us is no longer secure or you would like more information about our security practices, please contact us at [privacy@centercode.com](mailto:privacy@centercode.com). In the event that any Personal Data under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will investigate the situation and, where appropriate or required by law, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

## Updating Email Preferences

## Data Modification, Deletion, and Other Rights

Individuals located in certain countries, including those residing in the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland (“ **European Residents** ”), have certain statutory rights regarding their Personal Data. For European Residents, reference to “Personal Data” in this privacy policy is equivalent to “Personal Data” as defined in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Subject to any exemptions provided by law, these individuals may have the right to request access to their Personal Data, or seek to update, delete, or correct Personal Data. If your request relates to Personal Data within the scope of the GDPR, your rights may be exercised by contacting [privacy@centercode.com](mailto:privacy@centercode.com). Any European Resident who is dissatisfied with our handling of a request regarding Personal Data within the scope of the GDPR, has a right to lodge a complaint with his or her local data protection authority responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR.

If your request relates to information that we hold and process for our customer, please contact our customer, or for more information, read [Customer Data Handling Practices](https://web.archive.org/customer-data/).

For your protection, we may need to verify your identity before implementing any request relating to your Personal Data. We will respond to your request promptly, and in no more than 30 days from your request, subject to applicable law. Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, such as retaining copies of agreements you have entered into with us and/or for audit and investigation purposes, or in the event of a court order or requirement of law.

Deleted or updated Personal Data stored in our backup systems will be automatically deleted or updated within a reasonable period of time during our backup procedures, except as otherwise required by applicable law.

These countries may not offer the same legal protections offered in your country and may be considered by your country to offer insufficient legal protections.

European Residents have a right to withdraw their consent to cross-border transfers of their data, and if you wish to do so with respect to your Personal Data that we control, you may contact us at [privacy@centercode.com](mailto:privacy@centercode.com).
