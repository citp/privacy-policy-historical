						<p>This Privacy Policy describes how CenterPoint Energy handles information we learn about you from 
						your visit to our website.  The information we receive depends on what you do when you 
						visit our site.</p>
						
						<p>For each visitor to our Web page, we automatically collect the domain name, IP address, 
						and e-mail address (where possible) of visitors to our Web page, the e-mail addresses of 
						those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers 
						access or visit, user-specific information on what pages consumers access or visit, 
						information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site 
						registrations.</p>
						
						<p>The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web page, to customize 
						the content and/or layout of our page for each individual visitor, to notify consumers 
						about updates to our Web site, and to contact consumers for marketing purposes. The 
						information may also be shared with other reputable organizations to help them contact 
						consumers for marketing purposes.  CenterPoint Energy reserves the right to transfer aggregated 
						user information to third parties, provided that no personal information relating to any 
						individual user is disclosed.</p>
						
						<p>With respect to cookies: We use cookies to store visitors preferences, record session 
						information, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, alert 
						visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our 
						site, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors 
						return to our site, and ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads.</p>
						
						<p>If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by 
						sending us e-mail at the above address.  From time to time, we make the e-mail addresses 
						of our customers and/or those who access our site available to other reputable 
						organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting. If you do 
						not want us to share your e-mail address with other companies or organizations, please 
						let us know by emailing us at the address provided above.</p>
						
						<p>If you supply us with additional information on-line (your name, postal address, 
						telephone number, or any other identifying information), you may be contacted by us or 
						by other reputable companies (by mail, e-mail, or telephone) with information on new 
						products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such 
						communications, you will be provided an opportunity to "opt-out" of such uses at the 
						time you provide the information to us.  Or you can e-mail us at any time and we will 
						remove your name from our contact list at your request.</p>
						
						<p>From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not 
						previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some 
						time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of 
						these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are 
						concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site 
						periodically.</p>
						
						<p>This site contains links to other sites.   CenterPoint Energy is not responsible for the privacy 
						practices of such other sites.</p>
						
						<p>CenterPoint Energy does not seek to collect personal information about or from minors.  However we 
						recognize that special concerns exist whenever children are online.  In areas of the 
						CenterPoint Energy website that may be of particular interest to children, we will use our best 
						efforts not to collect personal information from those identifying themselves as under 
						age 18.  CenterPoint Energy encourages parents to take an active role in their children's use of 
						the Internet and to spend time online with their children.  If you believe that your 
						child has submitted personal information to CenterPoint Energy inadvertently, we will delete all 
						such information from our database at your request.</p>
