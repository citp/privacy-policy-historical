# Privacy Policy

#### C7 Data Centers takes privacy and data protection issues seriously. Our Privacy Policy applies to basic contact information collected from customers who contract with C7 to use our services. As our services change, we may revise this policy. If you have questions about our privacy practices please [contact us](http://www.c7.com/contact-us/ "Contact Us").

#### Information Collected

C7 collects information from its customers through a Master Service Agreement and a Statement of Work for services. We only obtain information via our website when an individual or company requests a price quotation or has questions about C7 and its services. At that time, we will ask for contact information such as person’s name, phone number or e-mail address.

#### Information Disclosure

Protecting customer information is an important part of our business. We may release customer information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or to verify information with other companies for fraud protection and risk reduction.

#### Information Security

Information security is critical to our business. We work to protect the security of a customer’s information through the use of security and encryption software. Any information that is gathered is stored on servers located in a secure data center. The number of authorized people with access to these servers is limited. Firewalls and other security technology are used to prevent system servers and computers from being accessed by unauthorized persons. It is the customer’s responsibility to protect against misuse of the customer’s Login Name and Password.

#### System Access

C7 gives customers’ authorized personnel the ability to set system access and user permissions on an individual basis, including system view and administrative settings.
