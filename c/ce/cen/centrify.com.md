#### Customer Data

Centrify Customers may electronically submit information through the Software and Services ('Customer Data').

In accordance with our agreements with our Customers, Centrify may access Customer Data (other than as expressly set out in this Privacy Statement) only for the purpose of providing Software and Services, preventing or addressing service or technical problems, license enforcement and at a Customer's request in connection with other customer support matters, professional services, or as may be required by law.

#### Data Collected through the Centrify Software and Services

Centrify collects and processes 3rd party personal data in addition to the personal data referred to in the table above under the direction of our Customers and only to provide the Software and Services our Customer has agreed to. This includes, for example:

**Personal Data**

| 

**Why the Personal Data is used by the Software and Services**  
  
---|---  
  
Unique Device ID (UDID), a system generated unique user ID, and a device IP address

| 

To identify the device used  
  
End User login information in the form of a username and password

A user display name, one-time passcodes and user security question/answer

| 

To determine whether to request more information for multi-factor authentication  
  
User location which is determined using geolocation technology together with third party databases

| 

To provide functionality such as locating lost or stolen devices. End Users who do not want their location used can turn off location services in their account settings or mobile phone settings.  
  
We have no ownership of this information or any direct relationship with individual End Users whose personal data may be processed as part of providing our Software and Services. If you are a customer or End User of one of our Customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Customers that use our Services, please contact our Customer that you interact with directly. Centrify may transfer personal data to companies that help us provide our Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by our software subscription, licensing and service agreements with our Customers.

Centrify acknowledges that End Users have the right to access their personal information and to request erasure, rectification and data portability. An individual who seeks access to or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data which Centrify holds solely in order to provide its Software and Services should direct his/her query to the Centrify Customer they interact with directly (the data controller). If a Centrify Customer requests that we remove personal data on their behalf, we will respond to their request within one month. Our Customers’ right to receive their Customer Data is covered by the software subscription, licensing or services agreements with them.

#### Customer Provided Content

Some Services permit Customers to store customer content such as documents, images and other digital information (“Customer Content”). Centrify processes and stores Customer Content that Customers choose to upload into the Services. Customer Content is accessible only by the Customer and Centrify does not use Customer Content for any other purpose. Each Customer is solely responsible for its Customer Content including that Customer Content is not inappropriate or unlawful and that it does not contain any viruses or harmful content. If Centrify determines in its sole discretion that any Customer Content may be inappropriate or unlawful or that it contains a virus or harmful content, Centrify may remove the Customer Content from the Services.

#### Google User Data

Through Google Directory APIs, the Services access and store Google Directory user profiles and group membership information to allow the Services to implement federated identity across Google Directory. This provides Google Directory users with “single sign on” to the apps that are accessible through the Services portal. Centrify does not share Google Directory user profiles and group information with third parties.

Centrify will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Customers for as long as needed to provide services and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

#### Anonymous Data Collected

“Anonymous Data” is collected or generated by the Software and Services and is not associated or linked to Personal Data. Anonymous Data does not identify individual persons. Centrify de-identifies by removing Personal Data and aggregates data so the data cannot be traced to End Users or their devices. Centrify may share Anonymous Data with business partners for use for their business purposes.

#### Security

The security of our Customer’s personal data is important to us. Centrify uses robust security measures to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of Customer Data. When the Services are accessed over the Internet (from a browser or Centrify supplied on-premises Software) Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology protects Customer Data using both server authentications for data-in-transit and data encryption of Customer Data stored at rest in Centrify Services. These technologies are intended to ensure that Customer Data is safe, secure, and only available to the Customer to whom the information belongs and those to whom the Customer has granted access using unique encryption keys. Centrify hosts its Services in a secure server environment that uses firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other advanced technology designed to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, however, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee or warrant its absolute security. If you have any questions about security, you can contact us at [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f686849f8097958fb695939882849f908fd895999b). Customers are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of their End User usernames and passwords.

Simply send your request to [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#50202239263133291033353e24223936297e333f3d).
