  Policy and other terms in our Terms of Use. We may periodically make changes

<p><b>1. Information We Collect; How We Collect It</b><br>
  We may request at times that you voluntarily supply us with personal information. 
  Such personal information includes information that may be used to identify 
  an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or 
  other physical address, an email address, phone number, and other contact information, 
  whether at work or at home. Generally some or all of this information is requested 
  when you register on the Site.</p>
<p>Century21Grand.com, its service providers and all vendors providing products 
  or services through our Site use your personal information to, among other things: 
  operate the Site and fulfill your requests; conduct research; and market or 
  promote other products or services of interest to you.</p>
<p>Century21Grand.com also automatically receives and records information 
  on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information 
  and the pages you request. We intend to continue improving the content and function 
  of our Site, and we monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help 
  Century21Grand.com provide content of interest to you, add and improve features 
  of our Services and enhance the design and layout of our Site. We use cookies 
  to recognize you when you return to the site in the future. This is done as 
  a convenience to you so that you don't need to re-register."</p>
<p><b>2. Is Information Shared or Disclosed?</b><br>
  Century21Grand.com may store and disclose personal information as allowed 
  or required by applicable law, including making disclosures that are necessary 
  or advisable to: </p>
<p>(a) protect the rights, safety or property of users of our Site, the public, 
  Century21Grand.com or our suppliers; and </p>
<p>(b) conform to legal or regulatory requirements. </p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, Century21Grand.com may choose to trade, sell 
  or rent your personal information with trustworthy third parties. Also, if Century21Grand.com should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, we may 
  sell the information you provide to Century21Grand.com on this Site to a 
  third party or share your personal information with any company with whom we 
  merge. Users who would rather not provide any of the information requested by 
  our registration process do not need to register with Century21Grand.com. 
  You can still view some of the content available on our Site without registering. 
  You will, however, need to register to access most of the information available 
  on our Site.</p>
<p><b>3. Some Examples of When We Share Your Information</b><br>
  We work with many publishers and their agents to provide you with access to 
  the content available on this Site. Accordingly, certain items and content on 
  the Site are delivered to you by companies other than Century21Grand.com. 
  This includes property and community information. In the cases where you purchase 
  an item on our Site that is fulfilled by another company, you become a customer 
  of the publisher or seller of that item, and we will provide certain of your 
  personal information to that third party. We typically provide personal information 
  such as the item purchased, the price you paid, your name, your email address 
  and your mailing address. We may also ask you to provide us with certain marketing 
  or demographic information at the time of your purchase. If you choose to provide 
  us with any such marketing or demographic information, we may be contractually 
  obligated to share this information with the applicable third party. We generally 
  have no control over how the third party will use your personal information, 
  which might include direct marketing of other products from the same company, 
  or the marketing of your name and address to other companies for the purpose 
  of marketing other products and services to you.</p>
<p>In any case, we will not be liable for any damages that may result from the 
  use or misuse of your personal information by third parties from which you purchase 
  items through the Services or by third parties with whom we have marketing and 
  other partnerships.</p>
<p><b>4. How to Stop Sharing of Information</b><br>
  You can let us know that you do not wish to receive information about new features 
  and special offers by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@century21grand.com?subject=Privacy Policy">privacy@century21grand.com</a>. You can 
  also "opt-out" of having your information shared by sending and email 
  to <a href="mailto:privacy@century21grand.com?subject=Privacy Policy">privacy@century21grand.com</a>. Please note that you will not be able to opt out 
  of Century21Grand.com sharing certain of your personal information with 
  a third party from whom you choose to purchase items through this Site. To cancel 
  your Century21Grand.com account, you will need to contact <a href="javascript:mailpop('info','')">info@century21grand.com</a>.</p>
<p><b>5. Security and Passwords</b><br>
  The personally identifiable information we collect about you is stored in limited 
  access servers. Century21Grand.com intends to take reasonable and appropriate 
  steps to protect such information from unauthorized access or disclosure. While 
  we make efforts to ensure that your information is secure on our system, no 
  data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As 
  a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to 
  us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>When your password is requested on this Site, we use secure socket layer (SSL) 
  encryption to present secure pages to protect that information. You can tell 
  if you are using a secure server by looking at the bottom of your browser window. 
  In Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will see a lock icon. When the 
  symbol is unbroken or the padlock appears to be in its closed state, the page 
  is encrypted and therefore secure. If you wish to take advantage of the latest 
  encryption standards, be sure you have the latest version of the browser you 
  use. You can download the latest version from the Netscape or Microsoft web 
  sites. Using beta versions of browsers is not recommended.</p>
<p>You can change your password at any time, and you can set a new password in 
  case you forgot your old one which is accessible from our home page. Please 
  keep your password in a safe place and do not to divulge it to anyone. Also 
  remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have 
  finished your visit. This is especially important if you are sharing a computer 
  with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library 
  or Internet cafe.</p>
<p>Your account is protected by your password. You choose a password when you 
  first start an account with us. Your password needs to: <br>
  - be at least 5 characters long (case sensitive)<br>
  - include both numbers and letters<br>
  - not contain symbols (*, $, #, %, etc.)<br>
  Make sure to select a password that is not obvious. A good password includes 
  seemingly random letters and numbers, for example, F3M8N1.</p>
<p><b>6. Emails Sent to You</b><br>
  We will send you emails relating to certain activities including when you request 
  property information. We may send you email notices about new features, products 
  and services. We may also send you email notices regarding Site and service 
  announcements containing important information about the Services. You can unsubscribe 
  to these notifications by following the 'unsubscribe' instructions at the bottom 
  of the email you receive. </p>
<p><b>7. Cookies</b><br>
  Cookies are pieces of information that your browser receives from web sites 
  and stores on your computer's hard drive. Century21Grand.com uses cookies 
  to improve our Site and make it easier to use. Cookies permit Century21Grand.com to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information. 
  Century21Grand.com (or a third-party provider we contract with) may occasionally 
  include specific tags (also known as "clear gifs" or "web beacons") 
  on selected web pages or email messages to customers. The tags provide statistical 
  information to Century21Grand.com so we can better understand what communications 
  are successful. </p>
<p><b>8. Children/Minors</b><br>
  This Site is not intended for or directed to persons under the age of 18. Century21Grand.com does not sell products for purchase by children. Any person who provides 
  their information to Century21Grand.com through the registration page for 
  new users or any other part of the Site represents to Century21Grand.com 
  that they are 18 years of age or older.</p>
