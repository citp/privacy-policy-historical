# Our Privacy Policy - Chicago.com

### Introduction

To provide you with a single source for purchasing hotel reservations, Chicago.com has engaged Priceline Partner Network Limited ('PPN') to host this private label travel Web site. In order to make a reservation on this Web site it is necessary for you to provide personally identifiable information to PPN to execute the purchase. Your identity and other relevant details are then provided to the hotel company to process the reservation.

The following describes the privacy policy (as amended or otherwise changed from time to time, the 'Privacy Policy') applicable to our services available through the Chicago.com web site (the 'Site') from PPN, and also describes certain practices related to the EU Safe Harbor (as defined below). Certain services which you may access on the Site are provided by our third party partners, and protection of your information relating to such services will be governed by the privacy policy of such third party (see 'Sharing Your Personal Data-Certain Services,' below). By visiting the Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure and processing of your personal data described in this Privacy Policy.

On occasion PPN may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, our Personal Data collection and use practices, the features of our Site, or advances in technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your Personal Data, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. PPN will also prominently post such material changes prior to implementing the change.

### Our Commitment to Your Privacy

We process EU Affiliate Data on behalf of, and in accordance with the instructions of, our relevant affiliates in the EU, such as in connection with customer support and other business functions. In addition, in limited circumstances, we may also obtain EU Affiliate Data as necessary or appropriate in connection with litigation, government inquiries, internal inquiries, or similar matters. Questions about EU Affiliate Data should be directed to us as specified in the 'How to Contact Us' section below. If we or our EU affiliates cannot answer or resolve such questions directly, the individual concerned may contact the data protection authorities in their home country in the EU for further information. In addition, we maintain internal policies and procedures governing the handling of EU Employee Data.

We may revise this list from time to time if we decide to offer additional services through these or other third-party partners.

 _PPN's Agents_ : Many of the operations we perform require us to hire other companies to help us with these tasks. For example, PPN hires companies to help us handle mail and e-mail (including sending and delivering packages, postal mail and e-mail) analyze the data we collect, market our products and services, handle credit card transactions and provide customer service. The companies we employ to help us with these tasks have access to Personal Data to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
