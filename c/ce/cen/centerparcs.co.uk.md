It is essential for us to pass on certain details to subcontracted companies or organisations in order that your break or related services can be provided, for example, to send out brochures or arrival packs. When you make a brochure request or booking this means that you consent to our passing on such details to our subcontractors.  
When you use this site and provide personal information, you are agreeing that we may transfer, disclose, sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties (in addition to our authorised direct marketing agents and our subsidiary, parent or associated companies) unless you tell us that you do not wish this to happen.

**SECURITY  
**We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure.   In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect on line.   We use encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information.  
**OTHER WEB SITES  
**Our web site may contain links to enable you to visit other web sites of interest easily.   However, once you have used these links to leave our site you should note that we do not have any control over that other web site.   Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement.   You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the web site in question.  
**HOW WE USE COOKIES  
**A cookie is a piece of text which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive.   Once you agree, your browser adds that text in a small file.   A cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site.   Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual.   The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.   For example, when you visit an electronic store, a cookie makes it easier to shop, by allowing you to place things into a shopping basket; the basket itself is not the cookie, the cookie is placed on your hard drive and keeps track of your basket versus others in use at the same time.

We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The type of information we collect includes the pages visited, a booking and value of the booking. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of this website analysis tool by clicking here <http://centerparcs.112.2o7.net/optout.html> 

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better web site, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not.   A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.   This practice is strictly in force.   We know that people have concerns about cookies, but we believe that the benefit we both gain from their proper use is worthwhile.   You may set your web browser (Microsoft internet explorer or Netscape navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests or decline cookies completely.   You can delete the files that contain cookies - those files are stored as part of your internet browser.
