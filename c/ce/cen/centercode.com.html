<p class="pagehead">Centercode Privacy Policy</p>
<p>The following outlines Centercode's current policy regarding user privacy.</p><hr><p></p>


<style>
  .par { margin: 20px 0px 0px 0px;}
</style>

<p></p><div class="head">Introduction</div><p></p>
Centercode respects the privacy of anyone who uses the Centercode Web site 
(www.centercode.com) and Centercode Connect™ online application. Centercode 
gathers important information from our visitors and customers. We publish this 
Privacy Policy to communicate how we gather and use information about you, how 
we protect it, and how you can participate in its protection. 

<br><br>

Centercode provides its service to you subject to the Centercode Terms of Service 
and this Privacy Policy, which shall be deemed part of the Terms of Service. We 
reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy. If we change it, we will provide 
notification of the change at least thirty (30) business days before the change 
takes effect and include directions for how you can respond to the change.

<p class="par"></p><div class="head">Information Collected</div><p></p>

We require people who register to use the Centercode online applications (the "Services") 
to give us contact information. Depending on the services chosen, we ask for contact 
and account information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, e-mail 
address, password, and the number of users in the organization who will be using the 
Services, in addition to financial and billing information, such as billing name, 
address and credit card number. When you express interest in additional information, 
when you register for the Services, or after you become a user, we may ask for 
additional personal information, such as title, department name, fax number, number 
of employees, or industry. You can opt out of providing additional information by 
not entering it when asked. Centercode does not distribute or share customer e-mail 
addresses, except as noted in its Terms of Service, or as may be required by law. 

<br><br>

Centercode uses the information we collect to set up the Services for individuals 
and their organizations. We may also use the information to contact customers and 
prospects to further discuss their interest in our company, the Services we provide 
and ways we can improve them, and to send information such as announcements of 
promotions and events regarding our company or partners. We may also e-mail a 
customer newsletter and updates about the Services or the company. You can opt 
out of receiving these communications by replying to them at the time they are 
distributed or at any time by e-mailing <a href="mailto:support@centercode.com">support@centercode.com</a> 

<br><br>

All financial and billing information that we collect through the centercode.com 
Web site and the Services is used solely to bill for the Services. Centercode 
does not use this billing information for marketing or promotional purposes. 
Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as 
provided for in the Centercode Terms of Service, we do not disclose to any 
third party the information provided. 

<br><br>

Centercode has referral relationships with third-party companies and 
individuals ("Referral Partners") who refer their customers to the Centercode 
Services. Customers who become paying users of the Centercode Services through 
a Referral Partner are considered customers of both Centercode and the Referral 
Partner. Centercode and a Referral Partner may share customer contact as well 
as account, financial and billing information with respect to their joint 
business relationship with the customer. The sharing of this information 
allows Centercode and the Referral Partner to establish the identity of the 
shared customer and determine referral fees owed. This sharing also allows 
Referral Partners to provide consolidated billing services to the shared 
customer. Shared contact and account, financial and billing information is 
governed by the Centercode Terms of Service. Centercode does not share your 
business data with Referral Partners. 

<br><br>

Centercode uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. 
This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain and is not 
permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the 
sole purpose of credit card processing.

<br><br>

Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide information on the 
Web site, but they are not permitted to collect any information, nor does 
Centercode share any personally identifiable user information with these parties. 

<br><br>

Centercode customers use the Centercode Services to host data and information. 
Centercode will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such 
data except as provided in the Centercode Terms of Service, or as may be 
required by law. We will view or access individual records only with your 
permission (for example, to resolve a problem or support issue). Of course, 
users of the Services are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and 
security of their user registration and passwords. 

<br><br>

Centercode may also collect certain information from visitors to the Web site 
and customers of the Services, such as Internet addresses. This information 
is logged to help diagnose technical problems and to administer the Centercode 
Web site and Services in order to constantly improve quality. We may also 
track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical 
information from visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties. 

<p class="par"></p><div class="head">Security</div><p></p>

Centercode has security measures in place for Centercode Services to help protect 
against the loss, misuse and alteration of the data under Centercode's control. 
When the Services are accessed using <a href="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape Navigator 6.0</a> or higher, 
or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.0</a> 
or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects 
information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure data 
is safe, secure and available only to you. Centercode also implements an advanced 
security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications and hosts 
the Services in a secure server environment using a firewall and other advanced 
technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, 
Centercode requires unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time 
a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain 
data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of data. 

<p class="par"></p><div class="head">Third Party Sites</div><p></p>

The Centercode Services and Web site contain links to other Web sites. Centercode 
is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other Web 
sites. Customers and visitors must check the policy statement of these others Web 
sites to understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access a linked 
site may be disclosing their private information. It is your responsibility to 
keep such information private and confidential

<p class="par"></p><div class="head">Cookies</div><p></p>

Cookies are files Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive. They are used to 
help us authenticate clients and provide timesaving shortcuts and preferences. 
Centercode uses a persistent encrypted cookie, if the client requests, to save 
and retrieve individual authentication information as well as other per-client 
device preferences. When a visitor follows a link to the Centercode Web site from 
an affiliate or promotion, Centercode stores information about that affiliate or 
promotion in a session cookie. Acceptance of these cookies is optional. 
Centercode issues a mandatory session cookie to each user of the Services 
only to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a 
specific session. If you reject this cookie, access to and usage of the Services 
will be denied. 

<p class="par"></p><div class="head">Opt-Out Policy</div><p></p>

Centercode offers you a means to choose how we may use information you provided. 
If, at any time after registering for information or ordering the Services, you 
change your mind about receiving information from us or about sharing information 
with third parties, send us a request specifying your new choice. Send your 
request to <a href="mailto:support@centercode.com">support@centercode.com</a>.

<p class="par"></p><div class="head">Correcting &amp; Updating Your Information</div><p></p>

To update or change registration information, log on to centercode.com, and click 
links to these tasks. You can also correct and update information by e-mailing 
<a href="mailto:support@centercode.com">support@centercode.com</a>.

<hr>

Questions regarding this Privacy Policy or the security practices of the Services 
should be directed to Centercode's Security Administrator by e-mailing 
<a href="mailto:security@centercode.com">security@centercode.com</a>.
