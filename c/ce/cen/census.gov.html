<h3>Privacy Statement</h3>
</a>
<div class="INDENTED">

Thank you for visiting the U.S. Census Bureau's Internet web site and reviewing our privacy policy.  
The purpose of this policy is to explain how we handle information we collect from you during your 
visit to our web site.  It is important to keep in mind that we do not collect personally-identifiable 
information (name, address, e-mail address,social security number, or other unique identifiers) on our web 
site unless we specifically advise you that we are doing so. 
<h3>Privacy Policy for All Visitors</h3>

<b>Information Collected and Stored Automatically:</b>  When you visit our web site to read pages or download
information, we automatically collect and store the following non-identifying information: 
<ul>
        <li>The Internet protocol (IP) address from which you access our web site.  An IP address is a unique 
                number that is automatically assigned to the computer you are using whenever you are surfing the web. 

        <p></p></li><li>The type of browser, such as Netscape or Internet Explorer, and operating system, such as Windows 98 or
        Linux, used to access our site.

        <p></p></li><li>The date and time our site is accessed, for the purpose of monitoring demand. 

        <p></p></li><li>The pages visited, for the purpose of improving the usefulness of our web site by providing helpful links 
                and removing pages that are not read. 

        <p></p></li><li>The last site you visited, if that site contained a link to a Census Bureau web page, which indicates how you
        found this site.
</li></ul>
This information does not identify you personally.  We maintain the above information in system logs.  We use this
information to make our site more useful to visitors by learning the number of visitors to our site, the number of 
pages served, and the level of demand for specific pages.  We do not track or record information about identifiable 
individuals and their visits.
<p>
We generally do not use cookies, which are files or file entries placed on your computer's hard drive by a web site that
allows monitoring of your use of the site.  Some activities, such as using the American FactFinder, do require the use of
transient cookies.  Transient cookies are only held in memory and go away when you exit the browser.
</p><p>
<b>Information Collected from E-mail:</b> When you send us personally-identifying information in an e-mail, we use the
information you provide only to help us gather the information you might request.  In an effort to respond to your
request, information you submit may be viewed by various people within the Census Bureau.  Public notices issued by
the Bureau in which interested persons are invited to comment by e-mail will contain a notice of what we intend to do
with the data gathered.  Once received, the information in your e-mail is protected in accordance with law (e.g., the
Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act).
 </p><p> 
<b>Security, Intrusion, and Detection:</b>  For site security purposes and to ensure that 
this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs software programs to monitor
network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.  
</p><p>
An e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception.  Whether or not an e-mail is encrypted in transmission depends
on your software.
</p><p> 
<b>Links to Other Web Sites:</b> Our web site contains links to other federal agencies, international agencies, and private
organizations.  Once you link to another site you are subject to the policies of the new site. 

                </p><h3>Privacy Policy for Purchasers of Census Bureau Products</h3>

The following additional policies apply to purchasers of Census Bureau products.
 <p></p><blockquote> 
        To order products, you will have to provide us with <b>personally-identifiable</b> information to support the
        purchase.  The information you provide may be entered into a database maintained to service our customers. 
        While <b>personally-identifiable</b> information you provide is protected by law, we may be required by law to
        disclose the names and addresses of businesses that purchase our products.  
<p>
        If you are providing a credit card number, link to our catalog page to learn about our credit card security
        policy.  Any page describing a product for sale by e-commerce will include a "Buy" box at the bottom. 
        Clicking on the box will take you to a page linking to our credit card security statement.  
</p><p>
        Cookies are enabled to track your order through the process.    
</p></blockquote>
                 <h3>Privacy Policy for Respondents to Surveys and Censuses</h3>

Some Census Bureau surveys and censuses permit response over the Internet.  The following additional policies apply
to personally-identifiable information provided in response to a Census Bureau survey or census.  
<p>
</p><blockquote>
        To respond to a survey or census via the Internet, you will have to provide us <b>personally-identifiable</b>
        information.  For each survey and census, we provide an explanation to respondents about the
        confidentiality of the data and the laws that protect that data (e.g., Title 13, United States Code Section 9
        (a)). 
  <p> 
        To protect your privacy, in the remote chance that your survey or census responses are intercepted, all web
        data submissions are encrypted.

<h3>Document Accessibility</h3>
</a>
<div class="INDENTED">

The Census Bureau is committed to making every document on its 
internet server accessible to all.  Currently, we are reviewing our site
and making modifications to those pages which are not in compliance with
the Americans with Disabilities Acts.  We use Hypertext Markup 
Language (HTML) to create pages that are generally accessible to persons 
using screen reading devices, and we are careful in our construction of 
HTML documents to insure maximum accessibility.  We will include 
alternate text describing graphics.<p>

Many Census Bureau internet documents are in ASCII or HTML
formats.  These documents are accessible to persons using screen
reading software.  We also have a large number of documents in Adobe 
Acrobat PDF (Portable Document Format) files.  Currently, many 
people using screen reading devices cannot read documents in PDF format.</p><p>  

Adobe Systems, Inc., is producing various products designed to make 
Adobe Acrobat documents accessible to persons using screen reading 
software.  Their <a href="http://access.adobe.com/">
accessibility web pages</a> describe their efforts.  They also have a free 
downloadable accessibility plug-in, called Adobe Access, for use with the 
latest versions of the Adobe Acrobat Reader for Microsoft Windows 3.1, 
Windows 95, or Windows NT.  This plug-in, which is still in a beta 
version, helps to overcome some of the problems of reading PDF 
documents with screen readers.  While these tools are in development, 
we are committed to providing ASCII or HTML versions of these PDF files.
</p><p>

Comments on our accessibility policies are invited, and should be sent to:

<h3>Links to Third Party Sites</h3>
<div class="INDENTED">
For the benefit of our visitors, the US Census Bureau Web site contains 
links to third party sites not operated by the US Census Bureau.  
Such sites are not within the control of the 
US Census Bureau and may not follow the same privacy, security, or 
accessibility policies as the US Census Bureau Web site. The US Census 
Bureau is not responsible for the content or availability of those sites, 
their partners, or advertisers.

<h3>Census Bureau Statement on Statistical Quality </h3>
</a>
<div class="INDENTED">
<p>NOTE TO ALL DATA USERS: </p>
<p>All survey and census results contain measurement error and may contain sampling error. </p>
<p>Available information about these potential errors is provided or referenced in data products 
as they are presented. </p>
<p>The Census Bureau recommends that data users incorporate this information into their analyses 
as these errors could impact inferences. </p>
<p>Researchers analyzing the data to create their own estimates are responsible 
for their validity and should not cite the Bureau of the Census as the source of the 
estimates but only of the core data.</p>

Protection of Confidential Information -- Sections 9 and 214 of Title 13
<p>Sec. 9. <b>Information as confidential; exception</b>

</p><p>(a) Neither the Secretary, nor any other officer or employee of the
Department of Commerce or bureau or agency thereof, or local government
census liaison may, except as provided in section 8 or 16 or chapter 10
of this title or section 210 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and
State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998.<sup>(1)</sup>

</p><p>&nbsp; (1) use the information furnished under the provisions of
this title for any purpose other than the statistical purposes for which
it is supplied; or

</p><p>&nbsp; (2) make any publication whereby the data furnished by any
particular establishment or individual under this title can be identified;
or

</p><p>&nbsp; (3) permit anyone other than the sworn officers and employees
of the Department or bureau or agency thereof to examine the individual
reports.&nbsp; No department, bureau, agency, officer, or employee of the
Government, except the Secretary in carrying out the purposes of this title,
shall require, for any reason, copies of census reports which have been
retained by any such establishment or individual. Copies of census reports
which have been so retained shall be immune from legal process, and shall
not, without the consent of the individual or establishment concerned,
be admitted as evidence or used for any purpose in any action, suit, or
other judicial or administrative proceeding.

</p><p>(b) The provisions of subsection (a) of this section relating to
the confidential treatment of data for particular individuals and establishments,
shall not apply to the censuses of governments provided for by subchapter
III of chapter 5 of this title, nor to interim current data provided for
by subchapter IV of chapter 5 of this title as to the subjects covered

Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998, adds the reference to section 210.

</p><p>2. The Census Address List Improvement Act of
1994 (P.L. 103-430) amends section 214 making references to section 16
and "census liaisons."
