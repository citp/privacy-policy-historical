It is important to keep in mind that we do not collect personally-identifiable information (name, address, e-mail address,social security number, or other unique identifiers) on our web site unless we specifically advise you that we are doing so. 

### Privacy Policy for All Visitors

**Information Collected and Stored Automatically:** When you visit our web site to read pages or download information, we automatically collect and store the following non-identifying information: 

  * The Internet protocol (IP) address from which you access our web site. An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to the computer you are using whenever you are surfing the web. 
  * The type of browser, such as Netscape or Internet Explorer, and operating system, such as Windows 98 or Linux, used to access our site. 
  * The date and time our site is accessed, for the purpose of monitoring demand. 
  * The pages visited, for the purpose of improving the usefulness of our web site by providing helpful links and removing pages that are not read. 
  * The last site you visited, if that site contained a link to a Census Bureau web page, which indicates how you found this site. 



This information does not identify you personally. We maintain the above information in system logs. We use this information to make our site more useful to visitors by learning the number of visitors to our site, the number of pages served, and the level of demand for specific pages. We do not track or record information about identifiable individuals and their visits. 

We generally do not use cookies, which are files or file entries placed on your computer's hard drive by a web site, that allow monitoring of your use of the site. Some activities, such as using the American FactFinder, do require the use of transient cookies. In American FactFinder, transient cookies are used to keep track of user selections so that new requests for specific data or maps can be created more efficiently. No personally identifiable information is permanently retained on either the user's or the Census Bureau's computers. These transient cookies go away completely when you exit the browser. 

During December, 2002, we will be using a cookie to supress the prompt for our annual Web Site Survey. A '1' is stored as the prompt appears. The cookie will last for 8 days, after which it will expire. If the cookie is present on a user's computer, the user will not be prompted to participate in our survey. The cookie does not track wether or not a user has taken the survey. 

**Information Collected from E-mail:** When you send us personally-identifying information in an e-mail, we use the information you provide only to help us gather the information you might request. In an effort to respond to your request, information you submit may be viewed by various people within the Census Bureau. Public notices issued by the Bureau in which interested persons are invited to comment by e-mail will contain a notice of what we intend to do with the data gathered. Once received, the information in your e-mail is protected in accordance with law (e.g., the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act). 

**Security, Intrusion, and Detection:** For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. 

An e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. Whether or not an e-mail is encrypted in transmission depends on your software. 

**Links to Other Web Sites:** Our web site contains links to other federal agencies, international agencies, and private organizations. Once you link to another site you are subject to the policies of the new site.

### Document Accessibility

The Census Bureau is committed to making every document on its internet server accessible to all. Currently, we are reviewing our site and making modifications to those pages which are not in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Acts. We use Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to create pages that are generally accessible to persons using screen reading devices, and we are careful in our construction of HTML documents to insure maximum accessibility. We will include alternate text describing graphics.

Many Census Bureau internet documents are in ASCII or HTML formats. These documents are accessible to persons using screen reading software. We also have a large number of documents in Adobe Acrobat PDF (Portable Document Format) files. Currently, many people using screen reading devices cannot read documents in PDF format.

Adobe Systems, Inc., is producing various products designed to make Adobe Acrobat documents accessible to persons using screen reading software. Their [ accessibility web pages](http://access.adobe.com/) describe their efforts. They also have a free downloadable accessibility plug-in, called Adobe Access, for use with the latest versions of the Adobe Acrobat Reader for Microsoft Windows 3.1, Windows 95, or Windows NT. This plug-in, which is still in a beta version, helps to overcome some of the problems of reading PDF documents with screen readers. While these tools are in development, we are committed to providing ASCII or HTML versions of these PDF files. 

Comments on our accessibility policies are invited, and should be sent to: [James.R.Clark@ccMail.Census.GOV](mailto:James.R.Clark@ccMail.Census.GOV). 

### Links to Third Party Sites

For the benefit of our visitors, the US Census Bureau Web site contains links to third party sites not operated by the US Census Bureau. Such sites are not within the control of the US Census Bureau and may not follow the same privacy, security, or accessibility policies as the US Census Bureau Web site. The US Census Bureau is not responsible for the content or availability of those sites, their partners, or advertisers.
