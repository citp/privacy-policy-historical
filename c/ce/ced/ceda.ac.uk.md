Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) and Data Protection

At STFC (being a Council under, and part of, United Kingdom Research and Innovation), we intend to make sure that we maintain the UK as a world-leader in science and technology research - integral to this is our commitment to protecting and safeguarding your data privacy.

It is part of STFC’s public purpose to provide services such as the CEDA Archive and services and JASMIN Services, including the JASMIN Cloud service. In order to effectively provide that service to you, we need to collect information about you and may need to contact you from time to time with regards to its provision.

However, you must not sign up for a CEDA User or JASMIN User account if you are under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18 you must get someone with parental responsibility to open and manage an account on your behalf.

STFC considers it to be in its legitimate interest that it should be able to efficiently manage the CEDA and JASMIN services for the benefit of anyone who has signed up to access them. STFC therefore requests and securely holds the data which it requires for these purposes. Please ensure that, for so long as you are accessing these service, the information that you have provided to us is kept up to date via the CEDA and JASMIN user accounts or that you notify us if your information needs to be updated by [contacting us](http://www.ceda.ac.uk/contact/).

We may share your details with others outside CEDA's host organisation, STFC, to aid in the provision of data and services; for example: to gain third-party approval for your access to particular data and services; for external assistance in resolving user issues/answering enquiries.

####  UKRI and Data Protection

UKRI and STFC comply with the requirements of the GDPR with regard to the collection, storage, processing and disclosure of personal information and we are committed to upholding the GDPR's core data protection principles.
