We collect information needed to identify a Portal user and verify their authorization for the Portal. We also collect certain financial account information including credit card data, billing address and billing contact information for users making payments through the Portal. Portal users in the same customer account have access to each other’s email addresses and related information. The Portal assigns each Portal user a username and password upon account sign-up.

### Cedexis Radar, Openmix and Impact

Some Cedexis services require payment for which we collect financial information on third party sites. Cedexis relies on the services of Zuora for customer financial information storage (if any).

Cedexis undertakes reasonable security measures to protect data to guard against unauthorized access to personal data. If you use our Portal, you are responsible for safeguarding your username and password. For Customer Services, Cedexis’ security practices are governed by its agreements with its customers and partners.

### Data Retention and Disaster Recovery

We take reasonable efforts to backup data and distribute it among our geographically dispersed data centers in case of catastrophic failure. Integrity of these backups and the procedures for recovering from catastrophic failure are verified on a regular basis.

Cedexis Openmix and Cedexis Radar logs are typically kept for at least 13 months after use of the service unless otherwise agreed to with our customers and partners. Upon Portal account termination, information is typically retained for at least one year from the time of termination unless otherwise agreed to with our customers and partners.

### Sharing with Third Parties

Cedexis may share personally identifying information with your consent. Cedexis may also share information on an aggregate basis, for example through group-level usage reports.

If you have provided us with information as an employee of a customer, we may share your information with that customer.

We may share some or all of your information with our current or future affiliates, parent companies, subsidiaries, or other companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honor this policy. We may also share your information in connection with or during a merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving the sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets to another company.

Personal information may be disclosed to judicial or other government agencies subject to warrants, subpoenas, or other governmental orders or in the case of an emergency or to protect the rights and property of Cedexis, our agents, customers, and others.

Cedexis utilizes third party data processors in order to provide some functionality. We use infrastructure services for hosting of our platform and data processing, payment processors for billing, and authentication for security.

Third parties engaged by Cedexis to process personal data and any of our affiliates receiving personal data must: (i) comply with the Privacy Shield principles or another mechanism permitted by the applicable EU & Swiss data protection law(s) for transfers and processing of personal data; (ii) or agree to provide adequate protections for the personal data that are no less protective than those set out in this Policy.

Cedexis has responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives and subsequently transfers to a third party. Cedexis remains potentially liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if its agent processes such personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

### Choices

If you have an account in connection with our Customer Services, you can use the Cedexis Portal to review and change the personally identifying information stored by Cedexis.

If you are an end user of our customers’ and partners’ websites that use our Customer Services, please contact those customers or partners to request access to, changes to, or deletion of your information, and we will act at their direction.

If desired, users can opt-out of Cedexis Radar or Impact measurement activity by enabling the Do Not Track configuration settings offered by major browsers. If Do Not Track is enabled in these browsers, Radar will not collect analytics data nor any identifiable information about the user to be used as part of any aggregated performance measurements. While we make efforts to respond to major web browser signals as described above, there are many ways through which web browser signals and other similar mechanisms can indicate your choice to disable tracking, and we may not be aware of or honor every web browser setting or every mechanism.

When you visit our Websites, we and others give you choices described in our [Cookie Policy](http://www.cedexis.com/cookie-policy/) about use of mechanisms for tracking, including tracking of your online activities over time and across different websites and online services by third parties. While we and others give you choices described in the [Cookie Policy](http://www.cedexis.com/cookie-policy/), there are many ways through which web browser signals and other similar mechanisms can indicate your choice to disable tracking, and we may not be aware of or honor every mechanism.
