##### **Automatically collected information**

After you have accessed our web-site we may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for user analysis. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual, unless that information has been given by a user with informed consent. We may obtain information about your general CEEOL usage by using a cookie file, which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our website and to deliver a better and more personalised service.

In summary, the cookies we use enable us:

  * To estimate our general audience size and how they use our site

  * Track the first and last pages you visit and your total number of visits to the website
  * Track how long you spend on any page existing within our website

We use the personal information you provide in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was intended to be used:

  * to facilitate your use of the CEEOL website;

If you want CEEOL to stop using your personal information, see the “Opting Out” paragraph below.

##### **Data for Statements of Account**

Since CEEOL is obliged to provide for the copyright-holders statistical data regarding content usage and accounting data regarding downloads of payable content, all information needed for these reports and statements is automatically collected. The reports of CEEOL, however, do never provide any individual or personal, but only statistical data to third parties.

CEEOL provides COUNTER-enabled statistics to institutional customers. These statistics give some indication on downloads per IP address within the IP range of the institution. In the exceptional case that one IP address is linked to only one user, this may allow the reader of the statistics to draw a conclusion about this person.

##### **Data Security**

We have appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to the information we collect online. We nonetheless recognize that third parties may obtain access to information through unlawful actions, and thus do not promise that your information always will remain private, despite our efforts and the importance we place on maintaining your privacy. In addition, we do not claim any responsibility for information collected by or from websites linking to or from [www.ceeol.com](https://www.ceeol.com/). In the event that we discover or are notified of a security breach where personal information is at risk, we will notify you electronically if we have your email address. If you do not wish to be notified via email in the event of a breach, please contact us at [info@ceeol.com](mailto:info@ceeol.com).

##### **Disclosure of your personal information**

CEEOL may disclose personal information

  * if required to do so by law;
