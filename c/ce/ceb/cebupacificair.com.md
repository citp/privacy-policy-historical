When you register with Cebu Pacific, we ask for your name, email address, birth date, gender, postcode, occupation, industry, and personal interests. Once you register with Cebu Pacific and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. Cebu Pacific also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Cebu Pacific cookie information and the page you requested.

Cebu Pacific will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. Cebu Pacific will only send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when: 

  1. We have your consent to share the information; 
  2. We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; 
  3. We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Cebu Pacific to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.);
  4. We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or 
  5. We find that your actions on our web sites violate the Cebu Pacific Terms of Service, or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services. 



**Your Ability to Edit Your Account Information and Preferences**  
Cebu Pacific gives you the ability to edit your Cebu Pacific Account Information and preferences at any time, including whether you want Cebu Pacific to contact you about specials and new products. 

**Security**  
Your Cebu Pacific Account Information is password-protected for your privacy and security. In certain areas Cebu Pacific uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions. SSL is currently the preferred method to securely transfer credit card and other sensitive data over the Internet.
