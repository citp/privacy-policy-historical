## What Information We Collect and How We Use It

### Personally Identifiable Information

When you place an order for products or services we collect certain types of personally identifiable information required to fulfill those products or services, including (1) contact information, such as name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number; (2) payment information, such as credit card number, or (3) ID verification information, such as credit card number, date of birth, Social Security Number, or Driver's License Number, as may be required by a wireless carrier if you are requesting a new account.

We use this information to process requests for products and services. For those customers applying for new wireless service activation, this includes performing a standard industry credit check by inputting your data into the wireless carrier's system. Once the carrier runs the check, it informs us of an applicant's approval status so that we can either process the order or notify those applicants who have not been approved of their status. Aside from approval status information, we do not have access to an applicant's credit-history information.

We also use collected information to communicate with you, such as to notify you about updates to products, to send you order confirmations, or to provide you with important product warranty or safety information. Your e-mail address may also be sent a third party newsletter from WireOffers.com. You can easily opt out of this newsletter by visiting wireoffers.com or by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of these e-mails. In addition, we use contact information you provide to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you, by means of e-mail or through our newsletter, additional products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you. 

Information from IP addresses is used for system administration, to examine overall traffic trends, troubleshooting, etc. This information is used only in the aggregate form. IP addresses are not linked to any personally identifiable information, meaning the user session is tracked, but the user is anonymous. 

### Supplementation of Information 

We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect online with outside records (e.g., information from our Strategic Partners or from wireless providers) to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. 

### Sharing of Your Information 

Agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect it in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.

To fulfill your requests for products and services, we may need to share some of your personally identifiable information with both the wireless provider from which you would like to request service and the "Strategic Partner” through which you accessed Cell Phone Digest - cellstores, or with other affiliates or co-branding partners.

More specifically, when you place an order for wireless services, we will share names, contact information, and other information that is necessary for the wireless carrier to provide you with its services, and to provide you with products that we think you will find interesting. The provider may use this information for credit approval, service activation, and from time to time, for its own marketing purposes. You should consult the wireless providers' respective privacy policies, as this Notice does not cover their use of your information. 

In addition, if you access Cell Phone Digest - cellstores through a third-party site, such as one of our Strategic Partners' sites, we also may need to report certain personally identifiable information (e.g., name and e-mail address) back to that Web site. As we explain further below in the section that follows, we will tell you at the point of collection if we will share personally identifiable information with the Strategic Partner through which you access the Cell Phone Digest - cellstores service. 

In addition, we may share aggregated demographic information with our Strategic Partners, wireless providers and advertisers.

### Sharing of Affiliate Information in the Affiliate Sign-Up Process 

Information submitted by potential Affiliates in the Affiliate Sign-Up Process is submitted to Linkshare. Linkshare's privacy policy can be found here: www.linkshare.com.

### Our Collection of Personally Identifiable Information Through a Third-party Web Site

To provide you with content and service, we have relationships with many of the best service and content companies. As a result of these relationships, you can access Cell Phone Digest - cellstores through a third-party Web site. You can recognize most of the Cell Phone Digest - cellstores pages on these third-party sites by looking for the joint branding of Cell Phone Digest - cellstores and a third-party company. For example, if you see a logo on the page that says "Powered by Cell Phone Digest - cellstores," you are on a co-branded page.

Whenever you provide registration information on a co-branded page, that data may be shared with the third-party site through which you access Cell Phone Digest - cellstores. We may share personally identifiable information with third parties. By agreeing to this privacy policy, you give us permission to transfer your personal information to third parties for the purposes of analyzing it to make your experience better and offering products to you. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of such third parties, as this Notice does not cover their use of information.

### Third Party Sharing of Information

Cell Phone Digest - cellstores sometimes may offer content (e.g., promotions, affiliations, sponsorships) that is sponsored by or cobranded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity.

### Live Help Function

To better serve you and respond to your questions regarding our products or services, we also maintain a Live Help function through which we can respond, in real time, to your questions about our products and services. This information enables us to understand the types of questions our users have about our products and services so that we may continue to improve our content and offerings. 

### Non-Personally Identifiable Information 

We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about our visitors when you visit many of our Web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '98 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).

We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our service pages and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze service usage. 

### Legal Process/Disclaimer 

We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency's request. 

## Choices/Opt Out

If you prefer not to receive marketing information, including emails from us, or wish to fully deactivate your account information from us, simply let us know by sending a letter via certified mail to Cell Phone Digest - cellstores, Inc., 1010 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 600, Washington, DC 20007 or an e-mail to Customer Relations or by visiting www.WireOffers.com. Please note that even if you chose to opt out of Cell Phone Digest - cellstores's marketing, we will continue to send you important service-related communications (e.g., order confirmation or product safety information). However, these are not promotional in nature.
