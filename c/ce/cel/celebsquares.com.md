## Personal Information We Collect From You 

  


**Registration.** When you register for our Service as a Premium Member, we require that you provide your mobile telephone number and provide and retain the PIN number that we supply to you. If you register on our Website for a Basic Membership or if your Premium Membership is converted into a Basic Membership, we require that you provide your email address. On our registration page we ask our Members to provide their: (a) first and last name; (b) home address; (c) email address; (d) mobile and/or home telephone number; (e) screen name; (f) an icon or photograph; (g) a personal quote; and/or (h) any other information from or about an individual that we may request from time to time. If you elect to provide your mobile telephone number, you will be prompted to opt-in by checking a box to receive survey questions via text messaging that will include unrelated third party ads. If you do so, you will become a Mobile Basic Member. This information is not required in order to complete registration. We also collect your IP address when you register. We refer to information that identifies you such as your name, cell phone number, email address and home address as "Personally Identifiable Information"" in this Privacy Policy. 

**Website Visitors.** We collect information when you visit the Website through cookies, clear gifs and other means such as your IP address, browser type, ISP, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data. We store this information ("Log File Information") in log files. 

**Non-Identifying Information.** We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and your use of the Service (e.g., without limitation, birth date, time zone, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences) ( ** _"Non-Identifying Information"_** ). We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries. 

  


## How We Use Personal Information

Any personal information that you submit to us remains your property however, we may use this personal information to administer the Website and Service as described below. 

**Text Messages and Other Communications.** By providing your mobile telephone number, you expressly consent to receive a sign-up text message from us. In most circumstances, the text message that you receive in connection with the sign-up process will contain a unique, four digit personal identification number which is used to set up your account. If your wireless carrier does not support our Service, or you do not complete the sign-up process in full, you expressly consent to receive one promotional text message from us. 

By signing-up as a Premium Member, you expressly consent to receive Surveys and other communications from us periodically, typically weekly, via text message. As a Premium Member, you may control the frequency with which you receive communications by changing your account preferences on the Website. By registering for a Mobile Basic Membership, or if your Membership is downgraded from a Premium Membership to a Basic Membership, you expressly consent to receive (a) Surveys, with advertising information contained therein, via text message; and (b) other advertising content via email. 

You can opt-out from receiving any further promotional text messages by replying via text message with the word "STOP" or following the opt-out instructions. We also use your Personal Information to contact you via email with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your "user preferences" information. (See **"Changing or Deleting Information"** below.) 

**Service-Related Announcements.** We will send you service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so. For instance, for Premium Members we send text messages monthly to remind you that your membership is being renewed. If you cancel your membership, we may send you a confirmatory text message or an email. 

**Customer Service.** Based upon the Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to us, we will send you a welcoming text message or, for Basic Members, an email verifying your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request and to manage your account. 

**Supplementation Information.** We verify the cell phone numbers submitted by Premium Members when they sign up with information provided by a third party. 

  


## Log File Information

When you visit our Website and use our Service, we use Log File Information and survey responses to create a "profile" of your preferences. We tie your Personally Identifiable Information and your Survey responses to information in the profile to tailor the Surveys that we send to you, and to improve the content of the Website. We also use this information to analyze trends, administer the Website, track users' movements around the Website and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We link this automatically-collected data to Personally Identifiable Information. 

## Cookies and Pixel Tags

Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. "Cookies" are small data files that are stored by your web browser software on your computer. We use cookies to recognize you and personalize your viewing experience on the Website. For example, we use cookies to recognize user access privileges to the Website, to track Website usage and traffic patterns and to estimate our Website traffic. Although most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, if you prefer, you can decline the placement of a cookie on your hard drive by using the appropriate feature(s) of your web browser software (if available) to delete the cookie. Please note, however, that certain areas of the Website may not function properly if your web browser does not accept cookies. 

A "pixel tag" is an electronic image, often a single pixel, which is typically a transparent graphic image that is placed on certain pages of the websites you may visit. We may use "pixel tags" to do "pixel tracking." Pixel tracking, a common practice, uses pixel tags to track an individual user's online activity in connection with online advertisements. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of these advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics. For example, if you sign up for our Service or visit the Website from an advertisement on another website, or in an HTML based email, a pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track the advertisement delivered to you on our designated landing page and/or the Website. If you visit our Website and we provide links to another website, we may also be able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with that third party website from our Website. This data is collected for use in our marketing and research. Personally Identifiable Information about you is not collected by us in connection with this process. 

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

  


**Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.** We compile aggregated demographic information about our Members to better focus our Service to meet our Members' needs, preferences and to assist in our marketing efforts. We may also share aggregated data about our Member base including the number of Members that we have. 

We compile Survey responses and post the results on the Website and may use the results in advertisements and other promotional materials. We may also compare a Member's response to a particular Survey to determine the number of loyalty points awarded. 

We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log File Information with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information. 

**Surveys, Votes and Predictions.** If you choose to reply to a survey, place a vote or make a prediction via the Service, the response you provide in relation to such survey, vote or prediction may be made publicly available via the Website in connection with your screen name and profile picture or avatar. Such information can be viewed by other users of the Service. 

**Third Party Service Providers.** By submitting your Personal Identifiable Information to us, you grant us the right, subject to applicable state and federal law, to use that Personal Identifiable Information, other than your Social Security Number, to provide our Services. We may share your Personal Information with our third party prize fulfillment service providers in order to deliver any prizes made available via the Services. Additionally, for Premium Members, we share your cell phone number with third party billing companies, cell phone carriers and our third party customer care call center to facilitate billings, to process credits and refunds, for customer service and to communicate with you via text message. We may, from time-to-time, supplement the information we collect from you with outside records (e.g., information we obtain from other companies, including wireless providers) to enhance our ability to serve you. We may also share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties so that we can award prizes and when Members redeem loyalty points. These third parties are prohibited from using your Personally Identifiable Information for any other purpose. 

**Business Transitions.** We may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. 

**Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.** We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Celebrity Squares™ or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity. 

  


## Changing or Deleting You Information

You may correct, update or delete your Personally Identifiable Information in your registration profile, by making the change(s) or deletions on your MyProfile page on the Website, by emailing our Customer Support at [cs_support@celebritysquares.com](mailto:cs_support@celebritysquares.com) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. 

If you completely delete all such information, your account may be deactivated. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. 

If you would like us to delete your Personal Information part of our account in our system, please contact us at [cs_support@celebritysquares.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20130523035054id_/http%3A//celebsquares.com/index.cfm/fuse/cs_support@celebritysquares.com) with a request that we delete your Personal Information from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. Deletion of your information will result in termination of your account. We will retain an archived copy of your records to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

## Links to Other Websites 

The Website may contain links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us. If you are a Mobile Basic Member and as such have opted-in to receive unrelated third party ads, there may be links in the ads to websites not owned or controlled by us. In either case, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Website or otherwise access a third party's website, to read the privacy statements of each and every website that you visit. 

This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by the Website. 

## Our Policy Toward Children

The Service is not directed to persons under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [cs_support@celebritysquares.com](mailto:cs_support@celebritysquares.com). If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files. 

## Security

We employ reasonable physical, technological, and administrative security measures and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the circumstances. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Sites in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. 

If you have any questions about the security practices of the Website, you can email us at [cs_support@celebritysquares.com](mailto:cs_support@celebritysquares.com). 

## Changes in this Privacy Policy
