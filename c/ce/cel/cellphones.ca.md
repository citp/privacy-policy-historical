## Who We Are

We are ten24 Media Inc.; a company incorporated in Canada, the registered office of which is 185, 11007 Jasper Avenue NW, Edmonton AB Canada, T5K 0K6, hereinafter "ten24" (also "we" "our" or "us").

By accessing or using the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms/).

## What Is Personal Data

Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable person. This includes, for example, your name, e-mail address and IP address.

## What Information We Collect About You and Why

What types of information we collect from you depends on how you use our website and what information you choose to provide.

We collect information from you when you:

  * Visit our websites or download any of our files
  * Create or register an account, modify your profile, set preferences, sign-up for offers or make purchases. (For example, we require individuals to provide their email address and a username when they register for an account. You also have the option of adding your real name, profile photo, location, and other details to be displayed on our Websites–but we don’t require that information to create an account.)
  * Add questions, comments, reviews, and other messages on our community forums, via web forms, email, or other methods
  * Contact us via email
  * Participate in any promotions, demonstrations, contests, surveys, or other marketing events



If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have an Informr account, your username / display name is part of that public profile, along with any other information you voluntarily put into your public profile, such as a photo or an “About Me” description.

Your public profile information is just that–public–so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.

We may collect information about your web browser or device, including your IP address, information about your visit (including how you came to the site and the name of the website you visit when you leave our website), and how you use our site. 

We use this information to help improve our website, communicate with you, provide support, personalize your experience and to market, promote and drive engagement with our services.

Third party services we use may also collect information about our website visitors. Examples of services we currently use include [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) and [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/)on this website.

### Community Forums / Comments

Our websites offer publicly accessible reviews, comments or community forums (questions/answers).

You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.

You should be aware that any information you provide, including your profile information associated with your account, may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites.

Your profile information and posts may remain even after you delete your account. Never post any personal financial information or other sensitive information into these public forums. When visitor's post on the site, we collect the data shown in the form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it.

The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: <https://automattic.com/privacy/>. Your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

### Media

If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

### Contact Forms

When you contact us via the contact form on this website, the information is sent as email messages that only a select few are allowed to access. The information is also stored in the database on our hosting server for backup and later reference purposes.

### Location Information

In some cases, we may collect limited location information from your IP address or information you volunteer. For example, we may use Google Analytics convert your IP address into a rough geolocation to understand in what areas our users are located and to improve and personalize our website (for example, to display the nearest retailers or to show services in available in your region).

## Cookies & Other Tracking Technologies

Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as viewing product information and reading community discussions.

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails.

We use cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.

If your browser is configured to accept cookies, we may collect non-personally identifiable information passively using "cookies" and "page tags".

If you leave a question or comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies.

These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.

When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information. Login cookies last for sixty days.

If you edit or publish a post (ie. comments, reviews, questions, answers), an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the post you just edited.

### Embedded Content From Other Websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

### Analytics

We use third party analytics services such as Google Analytics and these services use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, and any referring website, in order to help us analyze and create reports on how users interact with and use our services.

The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on.

Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better.

We collect non-personal information through our Internet log files, which record data such as browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Services.

### Advertising

We will never provide Advertisers with access to your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number without your explicit consent.

We may use your Personal Information to provide you with targeted advertisements or marketing communications we believe may be of interest to you. For more information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work>.

Third-party vendors, including Google and Facebook, use cookies web beacons, and other tracking technologies to serve ads that may be of interest to you. Any data collected will be subject to their respective privacy policies (which we do not control and for which we are not responsible). You can opt-out of targeted advertising by visiting the links below: [Google](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ads/website_custom_audiences/) [Bing](https://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/personalized-ads)
