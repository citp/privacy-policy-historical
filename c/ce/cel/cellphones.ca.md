# Privacy Policy - The Informr

**Last updated: October 26, 2012**

Your privacy is something we take seriously. Here at ten24 Media Inc. we have a few fundamental principles:

\- We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)

\- We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.

\- We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services. Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, ten24 Media Inc. collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ten24 Media Inc.'s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use our websites. From time to time, ten24 Media Inc. may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its websites.

ten24 Media Inc. also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our websites (ie. Cellphones.ca, TabletsETC.com). ten24 Media Inc. only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

Certain visitors to ten24 Media Inc.'s websites choose to interact with the sites in ways that require ten24 Media Inc. to gather personally-identifying information.
