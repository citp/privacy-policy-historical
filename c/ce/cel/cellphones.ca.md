# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: October 17, 2010**

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Cell Phones Etc. we have a few fundamental principles:

\- We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)

\- We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.

\- We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.

Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Cell Phones Etc. collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Cell Phones Etc.’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Cell Phones Etc.’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Cell Phones Etc. may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Cell Phones Etc. also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Cellphones.ca. Cell Phones Etc. only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Cell Phones Etc.’s websites choose to interact with Cell Phones Etc. in ways that require Cell Phones Etc. to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Cell Phones Etc. gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a user account at Cellphones.ca to provide a username and email address. Cell Phones Etc. collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Cell Phones Etc.. Cell Phones Etc. does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

Cell Phones Etc. may collect statistics about the behaviour of visitors to its websites. and may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Cell Phones Etc. does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Cell Phones Etc. discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Cell Phones Etc.’s behalf or to provide services available at Cell Phones Etc.’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Cell Phones Etc.’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Cell Phones Etc. will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Cell Phones Etc. discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Cell Phones Etc. believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Cell Phones Etc., third parties or the public at large. 

If you are a registered user of an Cell Phones Etc. website and have supplied your email address, Cell Phones Etc. may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Cell Phones Etc. and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Cell Phones Etc. takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
