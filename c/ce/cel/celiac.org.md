# Privacy Policy & Terms of Use | Celiac Disease Foundation

## Personal contact information we collect and what we do with it

When you are making a donation, purchasing a product, submitting an inquiry, utilizing our online tools, completing surveys or subscribing to our eCommunications, the Foundation asks you for personal contact information such as your name, mailing address, phone number and email address. We may use this contact information to provide you with a receipt or financial report; to contact you to clarify or obtain information about an order you placed or a donation you made, to respond to an inquiry, to provide you with requested information or documentation, or to send you additional information about the Foundation or opportunities we think may be of interest to you.

If you make a donation, we may contact you from time to time to thank you for your gift, to offer you an opportunity to volunteer or attend an event or to make another gift. We will always give you the opportunity to opt-out of future communications from us.

Personal contact information may also be shared with certain vendors, i.e., reputable companies we use for services such as shipping Foundation products or sending Foundation mail, or providing technology, services, data analysis, research, advertising and marketing assistance and/or content for the operation and maintenance of the Foundation Web Sites. This includes companies on whose behalf the Foundation collects your personal contact and health information when you sign up to participate in a clinical trial, research study, or focus group. We have confidentiality agreements in place with all such companies to protect your privacy.

The Foundation discloses personal information to third parties in aggregate form, that is, in a manner that cannot be traced back to you.  For example, symptoms assessment information may be shared with third parties to advance celiac-related research conducted alone or in collaboration with other organizations or individuals, or the Foundation might tell a sponsor how many males between 20 and 30 years in age have visited the Site over a period of time. In these cases, information is only provided after personally identifiable information such as name, address, telephone number, or email address has been removed.

We want to be very clear: We will not obtain personally identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us. Providing such information is strictly voluntary. Except and to the extent that the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“ **HIPAA** “) Privacy Rule applies to any health-related information you provide to the Foundation (in which case such HIPAA Privacy Rule governs), the privacy laws of the State of California will govern. We will retain your personal data for a reasonable period of time as long as the purpose exists for which the personal data have been collected or longer if required by applicable law.

In the event of a corporate change in control resulting from, for example, a sale to, or merger with, another entity, the Foundation reserves the right to transfer your Personal Information to the new party in control or the party acquiring assets. In the event of such a change, your Personal Information will continue to be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy unless any changes to the Privacy Policy are made in accordance with the section below that discusses “Changes to This Privacy Policy.”
