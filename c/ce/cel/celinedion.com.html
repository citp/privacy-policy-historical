    we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be used and/or disclosed.
    Please read the text carefully to understand our views and practices regarding

  <p><span><b>A SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS</b></span></p>
  <p><span>Parents should supervise their children's online
    activities and consider using parental control tools available from online

  <p><span><b>HOW WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION</b></span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;"><b>(a)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>From you</b></p>
  <p><span>We may collect and process personal information
    relating to you by you providing such personal information by filling in forms
    on our site or by you contacting us. This includes, but is not limited to,
    information provided at the time of registering to use (or become a member of)
    our site, subscribing to any services (e.g. <span class="grame">email or SMS </span>newsletters),
    purchasing downloads or other products, posting material or requesting further
    services.</span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;"><b>(b)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>By using
    cookies, web beacons or “clickstream data”</b></p>
  <p><span>Some information may automatically be collected as
    you browse our site. Our web server automatically collects information known as
    "clickstream data," such as the domain name of the service providing
    you with Internet access, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect
    your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system
    and platform, the average time spent on our site, pages viewed, information
    searched for, access times and other relevant statistics. </span></p>
  <p><span>In addition, we may use ‘cookies’ to collect information
    relating to your general internet usage. This information may include
    IP-addresses, browser version, number of visits and similar such information
    relating to your navigation of the internet and our site. A ‘cookie’ is a small
    text file that is placed on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies help us to
    improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service, for
    instance by storing information about your preferences and allowing us to
    recognise you when you return to our site.You may refuse to accept cookies by
    activating settings on your internet browser. However, please note that if you
  select such settings you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. </span> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Certain pages on our site may also
    contain “web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags or clear GIFs).
</p><p><span> </span><span class="grame">Web beacons may allow
    third parties to obtain non-personally identifiable information such as the IP
    address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears,
    the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing
    the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the
    information in cookies set by the third party. We use log files to store the
    data that is collected through web beacons.</span></p>
  <p><span><b>TRANSMISSION OF YOUR INFORMATION VIA THE
    INTERNET</b></span></p>
  <p><span>Unfortunately,
    the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Any
    transmission is therefore at your own risk. </span></p>
  <p><span>Once we have
    received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features
    to try to prevent unauthorised access. We use current industry standard
    technology to maintain the confidentiality and accuracy of the personal
    information you provide to us. We periodically review our security measures to
    ensure the security of your information. However, we cannot guarantee that any
    information you submit to us will be free from unauthorized third party
    intrusion. </span></p>
  <p><span>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen)
    a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are
    responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share the
    password with anyone.</span></p>
  <p><span><b>WHERE YOUR INFORMATION IS KEPT OR TRANSFERRED</b></span></p>
  <p><span>The information that we collect may be transferred
    to, and stored at, a destination outside Canada, for instance if any of our
    servers from time to time are located outside Canada or if one of our service
    providers or suppliers is located in a country outside Canada or if we share
    your information (in accordance with the ‘With whom we share your information’ section
    below). </span></p>
  <p><span>Where any of those destinations are countries that
    do not have information protection laws as stringent as those to which we are
    subject, we will take contractual and/or other means to ensure that your information
    is only transferred lawfully out of Canada and used in accordance with this
    privacy policy.  However, in circumstances where your information is
    transferred out of Canada, it may become available to a foreign government or
    its agencies under a lawful order made in that country.</span></p>
  <p><b>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>

    the following ways:</span></p>

    information, products or services that you have requested from us (or third
    parties, where appropriate) or which, based on your musical preferences or use,
    we feel may interest you. </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>to carry out our
    obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us and, as
    permitted by law to perform credit checks, report or collect debts owed, or
    protect our rights or property, our site, or its users</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>to measure the use

    anonymous basis. When we collect personal information, we may extract some of

    information, such as clickstream data. This combined information is used and
    analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us or third parties understand trends
    and patterns.<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Verdana"> </span></p>

    bulletin boards:  We ask each visitor who wishes to participate in blogs, chat
    rooms and bulletin boards on this site to provide an email address along with
    the visitor's screen name to access these functions. Each visitor who wishes to

    name and email address, the recipient's name and email address, and a message
    selected by the visitor. Except for the uses described in the paragraphs above,
    all such email addresses are used only to protect the security and integrity of
    the site, such as to take action against visitors who post inappropriate
    material or harass other visitors. You are responsible and are deemed to have
    consented to disclosure if you post your email address or other identifying
    information or content to a publicly viewable interactive site application such
    as a blog, chat room or bulletin board</p>
