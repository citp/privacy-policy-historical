This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal and non-personal information we collect when you use the Service, how we use such information and to whom and under what circumstances we may disclose it. By using the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Service. 

Cellfire uses the personal information we collect to provide the Service to you. We will not rent, sell or share your personal information with any other company for its own marketing purposes without your consent. 

## Information Collection

In order to offer you the best possible experience using the Service, we collect the following information: 

**Information you provide.** When you download and/or use the Service, we may ask you for personal information, such as your name, mobile phone number, email address, zip code, age, and gender. You may also have the opportunity to provide the email addresses or mobile phone numbers of friends or family members to tell them about the Service. We may combine the information we collect from you with information about you that we receive from other online and offline sources, such as from our merchant Partners, in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of the Service. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of our combining such information. 

**Mobile device identification information.** When you connect to the Service on your internet-enabled mobile device, if your service provider uniquely identifies the device, Cellfire will receive this information. Cellfire may use your unique mobile device identification information to offer you extended services and/or functionality. Certain Cellfire services may require our collection from you of the phone number for your device. Additionally, through the use of your mobile phone, we may collect your phone number and/or name. We may associate that information to the mobile device identification information and to other information we have collected from and about you; however we will not use that number for telemarketing. 

**Mobile device physical location.** Some mobile phone service providers are required to operate a system that will pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the provider, Cellfire may automatically receive this information. 

**Usage information.** As part of the standard operation of the Service, we may collect certain non-personal information from you. For example, when you use the Service, your mobile phone automatically records and sends basic information about your use to Cellfire. This may include the dates and times you used the Service, your phone’s manufacturer and model and your response to messages the Service sends. We may combine this non-personal information with your personal information. 

**Direct communications with Cellfire.** When you send email or other communications to Cellfire, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. 

**Information you provide on our Partners’ websites.** We offer some of our services in connection with the websites run by our merchant Partners. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Cellfire, and we will use it in accordance with this Policy. Our Partners’ sites may have privacy practices that are different from Cellfire’s (and which we do not control), and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. 

**Merchant Loyalty Information.** Cellfire may collect and store various merchants’ Loyalty Card numbers for you. These numbers will be stored on Cellfire’s servers, and will be transmitted between Cellfire’s servers and your device.
