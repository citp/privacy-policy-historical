Privacy Policy 

Last Revised: May 17, 2018

Catalina Marketing Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Catalina”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) know that you care about how your information is used and shared, and we take consumer privacy seriously. For more than 30 years, we’ve been committed to employing the highest standards of protection for the data we collect or maintain across the globe. We continuously strive to strengthen our protection measures to maintain the consumer trust that is paramount to our continued success and to that of our business partners and clients. 

Our privacy standards guide the way we conduct business each day, and Catalina’s Privacy Policy describes our practices and policies regarding the personal data we collect from individuals who visit Catalina’s websites, interact with Catalina online, and engage with us to use the products and services Catalina provides. 

## Information We Collect 

Catalina provides mobile, online and in-store personalized digital media solutions, including in-store and digital coupons and shopper-based communications. This Privacy Policy applies to data, including Personal Data (as defined below), collected as you use our website(s), applications or online services on which this policy is posted, and sets out your rights in respect of our processing of your Personal Data. Catalina is the data controller responsible for processing the data collected on the Sites, and this Privacy Policy will inform you of the nature of your Personal Data processed by us and how you can exercise your rights regarding your Personal Data. 

“Personal Data” means any information concerning your personal or material circumstances that may be used to identify you or other persons. We may collect, use, disclose or transfer (collectively “process”) Personal Data directly from users of our Sites, as well as indirectly, through the use of cookies and other technologies. In addition, we also process additional Personal Data from our clients in order to provide our services. 

### Personal Data You Provide to Us

You may choose to provide us with Personal Data such as contact information, last name, first name, email address, phone number, company name, information about a request or other similar information. Catalina processes this Personal Data in order to process your request, to provide you with the services and information you have inquired about, and to communicate with you about your request. The basis for processing this Personal Data is your consent and, in some cases, the performance of the contract with you (i.e. fulfill your request). 

### Personal Data Collected Automatically

When you visit Catalina’s Sites, we collect certain information such as your domain name, your browser type and operating system, websites you view, links you click, your IP address, the length of time you visit our Site or use our services, and the referring URL or website that led you to one of our Sites. We may also operate certain mobile applications that collect geolocation data, mobile device ID (or alternative ID where required by your platform provider), language data, device name and model, and operating system type and version. 

We use cookies and other tracking technologies to track how you use our Site. We use these tools to gather information about users to help us improve our services, performance and user experiences and to better understand how users access and use our Sites. The basis for processing any of this category of Personal Data is the adequate performance of the contract with you (i.e. to fulfill your request), for our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the functionalities of our Sites, or your consent. 

It is always possible for you to visit our Site without disclosing your Personal Data. This requires that you have disabled cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Sites. 

### Personal Data We Collect from Third Parties

Catalina works closely with many third parties and receives and processes Personal Data from such third parties. Catalina protects Personal Data obtained from third parties in accordance with the practices and policies described in this Privacy Policy, in addition to the obligations and restrictions imposed by the third-party source of the Personal Data. For example, we may receive demographic data to enhance our database in order to tailor the advertising, content and information that we may send or display to you and to improve our services and sites. The basis for processing this Personal Data is your consent or the adequate performance of the contract with you or between you and these third parties. 

##  How We Use Personal Data We Collect 

Catalina uses Personal Data we collect directly from you to administer and improve our Sites, to process your requests, to provide our products and services, to communicate with you about your requests, and for the purpose described at the time of collection. For example, we use Personal Data as follows: 

  * To provide you with marketing and other information that we think may interest you (unless you have opted out). 
  * To tailor the advertising, content and information that we may send or display to you, on our Site, to offer location customization, personalized help and instructions and to otherwise personalize your experiences while using the Sites. 
  * To display targeted advertising on third-party sites, mobile applications and other media, on behalf of Catalina and on behalf of our clients. 
  * To provide our services to business partners and clients, including sending or displaying offers, in-store and online, to consumers on behalf of our clients. 
  * To improve our Sites and services. 
  * For market research and analysis to better understand how users access and use our Sites, to respond to user desires and preferences, and for other business, research and analytical purposes, including marketing and advertising. 



## How We Disclose Personal Data

Some recipients listed above may be located in countries outside of the EEA that do not offer the same level of protection with respect to personal data as required in the EEA and where there is no adequacy decision by the European Commission. Catalina takes a variety of steps, including implementing the required data transfer tools like standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission or by choosing recipients that are Privacy Shield or BCR certified, to help ensure your rights and protections travel with your Personal Data.
