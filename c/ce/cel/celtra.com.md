  1. ****To explain important disclosures about the way we use information that you share with us as Visitors, Platform Users, and End Users.

### **For purposes of this policy:**

**“Personal Data”** for non-residents of the European Economic Area means any information that can be used to identify, contact, or precisely locate a person, including name, email, address, and telephone number.  

**“Personal Data”** for residents of the European Economic Area means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person. This includes IP address and advertising ID (IDFA/AAID).

**“Non-Personal Data”** means information not included in the definition of Personal Data, such as pages or ads visited, time spent on pages, browser and device type, and referring and exit pages. For non-residents of the European Economic Area, IP address and advertising IDs (IDFA/AAID) are Non-Personal Data.

## 1\. Information We Collect/Receive and How We Use that Information

In general, there are three categories of information we collect: **(1)** information that we can use to provide additional features and improved experiences if you choose to share that information; **(2)** information that we must have for you to use the Celtra Services; and **(3)** information collected from your interaction with the Celtra Services as an End User of a digital advertisement (hereinafter referred to as “ad” or “ads”).

When you provide Personal Data directly to us, this information is used by Celtra solely for the purposes identified at the point you provide it. Information we collect may be transferred, stored, used, and/or processed as follows:

**I. Contact Information**. When you contact us through the “Contact Us” page on the Website or become a Platform User of the Celtra Services, you will be asked to provide us with certain Personal Data about yourself which may include your name, email address, job title, name of your organization, mailing address, or telephone number.

Consistent with any permissions you may have communicated to us, we may use this information to directly communicate with you for marketing and promotional purposes via emails, notifications, or other messages, and to communicate with you for research purposes including via emails, notifications, or other messages. Platform Users may also receive communications concerning Celtra product updates, training sessions, or events or webinars. If you want to stop receiving such materials from Celtra, you can change your profile settings within the Celtra Services or follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

**II. Billing Information**. In certain circumstances, to use the Celtra Services, you may be required to provide additional information which may include a credit card number, expiration date, billing zip code, activation code, and similar information (“Billing Information”).  
Celtra uses this information to process payments. In certain circumstances, Celtra uses third-party service providers to manage credit card processing. These service providers are not permitted to store, retain, or use Billing Information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.

These third-parties collect and use information under their own privacy policies. To the extent Celtra uses cookies on behalf of a customer in connection with the Celtra Services, Celtra Cookies will persist for no more than ninety (90) days, but may be renewed each time the device is encountered.

  2. The right to ask us to delete any Personal Data that we hold about you free of charge, unless we are required to maintain a copy of this data pursuant to applicable law;
  3. The right to ask us to update and correct any out-of-date or incorrect or inaccurate Personal Data that we hold about you free of charge. We will take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up to date. If we refuse to correct your Personal Data, we will provide you with a written notice that sets out the reasons for our refusal (unless it would be unreasonable to provide those reasons) and provide you with a statement regarding the mechanisms available to you to make a complaint;


  3. The right to opt out of any marketing communications that we (or any third-party to whom we have disclosed your Personal Data with your consent) may send you or to withdraw your prior consent or object to any further processing of your Personal Data;
  4. The right to request information about any automated decisions made using your Personal Data that have legal consequences for you or which significantly affect you; and
