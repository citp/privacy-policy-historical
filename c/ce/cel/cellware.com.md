### Third-Party Contractors

We may share your information with third-party contractors and Service Providers who support the Services and Website by providing services to us or on our behalf, such as research companies, vendors, administrative service providers, technology providers, and selected partners for data validation, aggregation, enhancement, verification and suppression purposes, and for research, marketing, advertising, and data aggregation purposes. These third-party contractors will only have access to the information needed to perform these limited functions on our behalf and are required, to the extent practicable, to provide your information with at least the same level of protection and security as we use for the Website. We also may share information with advertisers, publishers and other third parties for marketing and advertising purposes, but such information does not include PII except if you provided it as part of your user registration as described above. 

### Companies that Acquire Our Business or Assets

If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, dissolution, or other transaction or if the ownership of all or substantially all of our business otherwise changes, we may share or transfer your information to a third party or parties in connection with the applicable transaction. 

### Our Affiliates

We may share some or all of your information with our parent company, subsidiaries and corporate affiliates, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us. We will require these entities to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended, with regard to their use of your PII. 

**Law Enforcement.** We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Bidtellect or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law. 

## HOW WE PROTECT AND RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION

We take security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. These include firewalls and encryption, internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices, and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems. 

However, the internet and mobile web are inherently insecure and so we are unable to guarantee that the security measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that your information will remain secure under all circumstances. 

If we retain personally identifiable information (‘PII”) on our systems, we restrict access to PII to employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our Websites, products and services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, if they fail to meet these obligations. 

Currently, Bidtellect retains Non-PII collected to report ad delivery (see, “Ad Delivery & Reporting” above) for up to six (6) months. However, other Non-PII stored in Cookies or in aggregate statistics, reports and summaries regarding ad delivery, and PII in registered user accounts may be retained indefinitely. 

Bidtellect reserves the right to delete any or all Non-PII or PII that relates to you at any time and in Bidtellect’s sole discretion, notwithstanding its normal data retention policies. If Bidtellect changes its retention data policies by updating this Privacy Policy, its new policies will apply to all data then retained by Bidtellect.
