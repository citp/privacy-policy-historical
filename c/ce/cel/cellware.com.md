# Cellware Privacy Policy | Cellware

Cellware.Com (“Cellware”), has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for the Cellware Web Site (“Site”).

Our site’s registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as an mobile phone number, carrier and email address). We use customer contact information such as email to send the user information about the sites and its related services. We use mobile phone number and carrier information in order to provide the services requested by the user.

Our site may use forms for customers to request information, products, and services. Participation in the completion of these forms is voluntary and any information you disclose will be held as confidential in a manner as explicit as you state in your form action. Contact information from any forms is used or will be used to send information about our company to our customers, and about our advertisers to our customers. The customer’s contact information is also used to communicate with the customer when necessary. 

We automatically collect information such as IP address, browser type, domain name, and access times. This information will merely be used to gather statistics, help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Site. The information may also be used to check for unusual activity such as attempts to manipulate or damage our system.

When you visit Cellware, we place a small text file — called a “cookie” — on your computer that allows us to identify your computer during the time that you are logged into the Cellware Site. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, and store your session information. Importantly, a cookie does not allow us to obtain ANY identifiable information about you or your account.

Some of our business partners or advertisers use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Cellware only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

In order to ensure continuity of your service, if Cellware is ever sold or all or substantially all of the assets relating to Cellware are transferred to another entity, we will transfer the information you have provided to the acquiring entity. You will be notified by an email sent to the email address that you have provided to us.

Choice/Opt-Out – Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us. Should a user decide at any time that he/she no longer wishes to receive communications, this site gives users the following options for eliminating service or no longer receiving communications. To optout, please send an email to [support@cellware.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20120329040838id_/http%3A//www.cellware.com/support@cellware.com) stating that you wish to cancel your account.

Legal Disclaimer – We recognize and welcome our obligation to comply with the law and this policy is subject to that obligation. We will, therefore, disclose personally identifiable information in response to a request from law enforcement officials or as otherwise required by law, or if we believe it is necessary to protect someone’s safety, or enforce our Terms Of Service.

Security – This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Your data is stored in a private database on a secure server.

Children’s Privacy Concerns – Cellware is not directed to children under the age of 13. We operate our site in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, and do not permit registration by, and will not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13 years of age. This requirement is clearly posted during the registration process.

Links to Third Party Websites – Cellware is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site, a user should read the privacy policy stated on that site. Our privacy policy only governs information collected on Cellware and Cellware sites.

Profiles, Message Boards, and Public Forums – Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information to profiles, message boards, or any other public forum, that information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications. Cellware is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit publicly on the site. Please think before you post any personal information online.
