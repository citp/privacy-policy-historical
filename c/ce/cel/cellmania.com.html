Cellmania will  not use information for purposes other that intended. </p>
<p><b>CHOICE: </b>Cellmania will not use  information for purposes other that intended. If there does arise a situation  where this is necessary,&nbsp; Cellmania will  offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their personal  information is (a) to be disclosed to a third party(1) or (b) to be used for a  purpose that is incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally  collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Individuals will be  provided with clear and conspicuous, readily available, and affordable  mechanisms to exercise choice.</p>
<p> Cellmania  has a policy of not collecting sensitive information. Should a need arise to  collect sensitive information (i.e. personal information specifying medical or  health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or  philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex  life of the individual), individuals will be given affirmative or explicit (opt  in) choice if the information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a  purpose other than those for which it was originally collected or subsequently  authorized by the individual through the exercise of opt in choice. In any  case, Cellmania will treat as sensitive any information received from a third  party where the third party treats and identifies it as sensitive. </p>
<p><b>ONWARD TRANSFER: </b>To disclose  information to a third party, Cellmania will apply the Notice and Choice  Principles above. Where Cellmania wishes to transfer information to a third  party that is acting as an agent, as described in the endnote, it may do so if  it first either ascertains that the third party subscribes to the Principles or  is subject to the Directive or another adequacy finding or enters into a  written agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide  at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant  Principles.If Cellmania complies with these requirements, it shall not be held  responsible (unless Cellmania agrees otherwise) when a third party to which it  transfers such information processes it in a way contrary to any restrictions  or representations, unless Cellmania knew or should have known the third party  would process it in such a contrary way and the Cellmania has not taken  reasonable steps to prevent or stop such processing. </p>
<p><b>SECURITY: </b>When Cellmania creates,  maintains, uses or disseminates personal information Cellmania will take  reasonable precautions to protect it from loss, misuse and unauthorized access,  disclosure, alteration and destruction. </p>
<p><b>DATA INTEGRITY: </b>Consistent with the  Principles, personal information must be relevant for the purposes for which it  is to be used. Cellmania will not process personal information in a way that is  incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently  authorized by the individual.
