		<h4>How We Use Personal Information</h4>
		<p>Any Personal Information that you submit to us remains your property.  However, we may use such Personal Information in any way to administer the Website, Services and Contests including, but not limited to, processing your entry into any Contest that may be made available by Celebrity Squares, sending Content and Game related information to your mobile telephone via text-messaging, email address or phone call, processing billing and refunds and fulfillment of Game and/or Contest prizes.  In addition, we may use such Personal Information, other than your Social Security Number and mobile telephone number (except where permitted by applicable law), to contact you about programs, products, features or services that we believe you may be interested in (such as future promotional materials) or for other purposes disclosed from time-to-time.  We also may use your Personal Information to contact you regarding your use of our Website or changes to our Privacy Policy, the Celebrity Squares Website Terms and Conditions ("Terms and Conditions"), the Celebrity Squares Service Terms ("Service Terms), the Game Rules and/or Contest Rules (as those terms are defined in the Service Terms) or other policies or terms that affect you and your use of our Website, Contests and/or Services. In addition, we may use information collected about our users to improve the Content and navigation of our Website, or for other internal purposes.</p>
		<p>We may, from time-to-time, supplement the information we collect from you with outside records (e.g., information we obtain from other companies, including wireless providers) to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our Content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
		<p>By submitting your Personal Information to us, you grant us the right, subject to applicable state and federal law, to use that Personal Information, other than your Social Security Number, for marketing purposes.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we reserve the right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute any and all Personal Information with/to any third-party for any and all uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and applicable law.  These third-parties may include, but shall not be limited to:  (a) providers of the products and/or Services that you requested and/or won by and through the Website and/or Services; (b) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (c) text-message and mobile telephone marketers (where permitted by applicable law); (d) e-mail marketers; (e) telemarketers; and (f) direct marketers.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we may also use your Personal Information for any Game and/or Contest-related purpose including, but not limited to, disclosing such Personal Information to third-party agents and independent contractors that help us operate the Game and/or any Contests.</p>
		<p>We will also use your Personal Information for customer service, to provide you with information that you may request, to customize your experience on the Website and/or to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into by you on the Website. You agree that we may contact you at any time with updates and/or any other information that we may deem appropriate for you to receive in connection with your continued use of our Website, Game, Contests and/or Services.  We may also use your Personal Information for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our business. We may also combine the information we have gathered about you, other than you Social Security Number, with information from other sources.</p>
		<p>In addition, we may disclose Personal Information collected from current or past users in the following instances: (i) in the event that we believe the Website, Contests, Game and/or Services are being used or has been used in violation of this Privacy Policy, Service Terms, Terms and Conditions, Contest Rules, Game Rules and/or to commit unlawful acts; (ii) if we are sold or acquired or where we deem it necessary or appropriate; and (iii) when requested by governmental or quasi-governmental authorities conducting an investigation, hearing or the like and/or if the information is subpoenaed.</p>
		<p>By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any third party when we, in our sole discretion, determine the disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the requirements of the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time-to-time.</p>
		<p>In addition, by submitting your Personal Information at the Website or via mobile device, you agree to receive email marketing from Celebrity Squares and our third party advertisers.  You agree that such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR § 310 et seq. (the "ATSR").  Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the ATSR.  Moreover, by registering with, making a purchase from, or requesting information from, a third party seller at or through the Website, such action shall constitute a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application with the respective third party seller for purposes of the ATSR and you may be contacted via e-mail, direct mail and/or telephone by such third party seller in accordance with the ATSR.</p>
		<p>In addition, by submitting your personal information to Celebrity Squares, you agree to receive mobile marketing including, but not limited to, text-message based marketing, from us and our third-party advertisers and marketers where, and to the extent that, such marketing is permitted by applicable law.  Notwithstanding that your mobile telephone number may be listed on state and/or federal Do-Not-Call registries, we retain the right to contact you via text-message based marketing to the greatest extent permitted by applicable state and federal law.  Further, you agree that we reserve the right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute your mobile telephone number and other mobile data with/to any third-party for any and all non-marketing uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
		<h4>How We Use Demographic Information and Aggregate Data</h4>
		<p>We use demographic information to tailor the Website to the interests of our users.  Demographic information is shared with third party advertisers so that they can tailor their advertisements to the appropriate audience.  Demographic information may also be shared with other third parties.</p>
		<p>We reserve the right to provide aggregate or group data about our users for lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data is data that describes the demographics, usage or characteristics of our participants as a group, without disclosing personally identifiable information.  By opening an account with us, you agree to allow us to provide such aggregate data to third parties.  By agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or communication to any third party when we, in our sole discretion, determine the disclosure to be appropriate.</p>
		<h4>Other Websites</h4>
		<p>The Website may contain links to other third-party owned and/or operated websites. Celebrity Squares is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.  In some cases, you may be able to make a purchase through one of their third-party websites.  In these instances, you may be required to provide certain information, such as a credit card number, to register or complete a transaction at such website. These third-party websites have separate privacy and data collection practices and Celebrity Squares has no responsibility or liability relating to them.</p>
		<h4>Our Security Precautions</h4>
		<p>We endeavor to safeguard and protect our users' Personal Information.  When users submit Personal Information at the Website, their information is protected both online and off-line.  The privacy of your Personal Information is very important to us.  The servers that we store Personal Information in are kept in a secure physical environment.  When our registration/Contest fulfillment process asks users to enter sensitive information (such as Social Security Number), and when we store and transmit such sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software.  While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take measures to protect information offline.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Therefore, we cannot warrant that your information will be absolutely secure.  Any transmission of data at or through our Website is at your own risk.  However, access to your information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public.  All of our users' Personal Information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the Personal Information to perform a specific job are granted access to Personal Information.  Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all user information.  Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your Personal Information.  You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach.  Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.</p>
		<h4>Minors</h4>
		<p>No information should be submitted to, or posted at, the Website by visitors under eighteen (18) years of age without parental consent, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from such individuals without parental consent.  The Website and/or Services is/are not for use by individuals under thirteen (13) years of age; provided, however, that if you are over the age of thirteen (13) but under eighteen (18) years of age, you may use the Website, Contests and/or Services, but only where you have a parent's consent.  We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate and monitor the interactive activities of their children.</p>
		<h4>Removal of Your Information/Opting Out</h4>
		<p>At your request, we will remove Personal Information that you have provided to us.  You may do so by e-mailing us at cs_support@celebsquares.com.  However, deleting your Personal Information or otherwise opting-out of receipt of communications from us or third parties will only change or delete the data in our database for purposes of transacting future business on the Website and for managing future communications from us and third parties. These deletions will not change or delete Personal Information already collected as part of a particular transaction in our database, which may have already been shared with third parties, all as provided above in this Privacy Policy.  You will need to contact third parties who may contact you directly to change your preferences or your personal information that they may be using to contact you.</p>
		<p>We provide users with the option to opt-out from receiving information sent via e-mail and/or text messaging (where applciable) on behalf of third party advertisers.  Users may unsubscribe from receiving e-mails and/or text messaging (where permitted by applicable law) at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every e-mail and/or text message, as applicable.  Unsubscribe requests can only be processed if you have registered with us in the first instance.  If you have not registered with us and wish to opt out of receiving e-mails and/or text messaging, as applicable, from a particular sender, please consult that sender's opt out policies or contact that sender.</p>
		<p>Information sent on behalf of third party advertisers is prepared several days in advance, so users may continue to receive e-mail and/or text messaging (where permitted by applicable law) from us for up to ten (10) days following the unsubscribe procedures detailed above.  If, after that point, a user is still receiving e-mail and/or text messaging from us, the user should contact us at cs_support@celebsquares.com.</p>

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add and/or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. All Privacy Policy changes will take effect immediately upon their posting on the Website. Please check this page periodically for changes.  Your continued use of the Website, Services, Contests and/or acceptance of our e-mails and/or text messaging following the posting of changes to these terms will mean that you accept these changes and agree to continue receiving e-mails and/or text messaging from us.
