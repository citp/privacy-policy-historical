<h3>CST AND ITS APPROACH TO PRIVACY</h3>
<p>Founded by research scientists in 1999, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">CST</span>) is a private, family-owned company headquartered in Danvers, Massachusetts, U.S. CST employs over 400 people worldwide, including at subsidiaries in the Netherlands (CST Europe, B.V.) (also known as Bioke, B.V.), Japan (Cell Signaling Technology Japan, K.K.), and CST (Shanghai) Biologic Reagents Trading Co., LTD.) (collectively referred to as “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">CST</span>”).  CST sells its products directly and through distributors in twenty-six countries.  The same CST scientists who produce our products also provide direct technical support and education via telephone, webcasts or in-person at conferences and vendor shows offered at many locations around the globe.</p>
<p>This privacy policy describes how CST collects, stores, processes, transfers, shares and uses data that identifies or is associated with you (hereinafter "<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Personal Information</span>") whether this information is collected directly from you during a direct interaction with us, such as at a conference or by telephone, and, any indirect collection of information, such as your interactions with this website (“<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Site</span>”) or any applications we may offer (“<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Apps</span>”) (collectively, “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Internet Services</span>”).  This privacy policy applies to all CST Internet Services, including:</p>

<p><b>International Transfers of your Personal Information: the Personal Information CST collects may be transferred to and stored in countries (including the US) outside of the jurisdiction you are in. Some of these jurisdictions offer differing levels of protection in respect of Personal Information and may, in certain instances, be less protective than the jurisdiction you are typically resident in. We take reasonable steps to ensure that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with applicable law and this privacy policy.</b></p>
<p>CST Internet Services use cookies to store and access information when you access our Internet Services.  You can find out more about our use of cookies in our <a href="/common/content/content.jsp?id=cookie-policy" style="text-decoration:none;">cookie policy</a>.</p>

<h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND HOW WE USE IT</h3>
<p>We collect Personal Information about you when you voluntarily submit information directly to us. This can include information you provide to us when you complete a form, purchase products, correspond with us, subscribe to our mailing lists, newsletters or other forms of marketing communications, respond to a survey, enter a promotion or use some other feature of our Internet Service or when contacting us by telephone, interacting with us at a conference, vendor show, or when supplying information to a distributor.</p>
<p>We also collect Personal Information from you indirectly such as information about the pages you look at (via providers like Google analytics) or the device you use to access the Internet Services.</p>
<p>We also combine the Personal Information you give us with information we obtain from third parties, such as Google analytics, distributors, conference organizers, or webinar partners, as examples.<br>
The list below sets out the categories of Personal Information we collect about you and how we use that information.&nbsp; <br>
<b>Contact details: </b>We collect contact information such as your name, your email address, your organization, your telephone number and addresses associated with your account or order. We will use your contact details so that we can communicate with you directly about the products we sell, the services we provide, deliver products to you and about queries, issues or concerns you or other users have. <br>
<b>Your role</b>: We collect information about the organization you work for and your role within it.&nbsp; We also collect information about your technical support needs, and projects or experiments you are working on.&nbsp; We use this so we can better understand your needs and to better respond to your requests for information, products or services or technical support.&nbsp; We will also use this information to determine products and services that may be of interest to you and to send you marketing communications in accordance with your marketing preferences.<br>
<b>Comments and opinions:</b> When you contact us directly, e.g. by email, phone, mail or by completing an online form we will record your comments and opinions.&nbsp; We will also record comments and opinions you express when responding to surveys, entering competitions or taking part in promotions we run. We will use your comments and opinions to address your queries, issues and concerns, to offer technical support and to improve our products and services. &nbsp;We will also use comments and opinions you express to determine products and services that may be of interest to you and to send you marketing communications in accordance with your marketing preferences. <br>
<b>Payment and transaction information:</b> We keep records of the products and services you purchase from us. We will use transaction information to process payment for any product or service you purchase from us. We will also use your transaction information and history to determine products and services that may be of interest to you and send you marketing communications in accordance with your marketing preferences.&nbsp; CST is transitioning to a third-party payment provider who will be solely responsible for your payment transaction information. In the meantime, CST maintains payment information for one day, during the evening payment information is erased. <br>
<b>Website and app login details:</b> Where you create an account with us we will hold your user name and password details so that we can keep your account secure.&nbsp;<br>
<b>Your preferences</b>: We hold information about the preferences you set for notifications, marketing communications and how our site is displayed or what content is displayed to you through our app. We will use your preference settings for the purpose of providing notifications, sending marketing communications and displaying our site in accordance with your choices.<br>
<b>Information about how you use and connect to our site or our app: </b>We collect information about how you use our Internet Service such as the pages you view, the time of your access, and how long you use the Internet Services, navigational information such as which websites you visited before and after visiting ours, and any selections and choices you make during your visit. <br>

This information can include details about the type of device, unique device identifying numbers, operating systems, browsers and applications connected to our site or our app through the device, your Internet service provider or mobile network, your IP address and your device's telephone number (if it has one).<br>
Typically, the information we collect about how you use or connect to our site is associated with your device and not you as a named individual. However, if you are logged into a registered account you have with us, this information may also be associated with you directly.<br>
We use Personal Information gathered in these ways to determine products, services, and educational opportunities that may be of interest to you and to call these to your attention from time to time. <br>

Your device's IP address may help us determine an approximate location. We may use an approximate location to ensure content on our site is relevant to the area, city, state or country you are using your device in. <br>
<b>Information provided by other users: </b>Sometimes, other people, such as your work colleagues or distributors, provide information associated with you. We will use Personal Information about you that is contained in private messages sent to us by other users to fulfill and deliver orders and to respond to any query, issue or concern they raise.&nbsp; Where users of our site or our app want to invite you to use our site, our app or to share information with you about our products and services we will use Personal Information that they provide about you to assist them in doing this; we will only do this though where they indicate that you have provided your consent for them to communicate with you in this way.<br>

Other Personal Information that you are not required to provide in order to receive our services may be voluntarily given and you are free to decide not to give such Personal Information.</p>
<p>We may anonymize and aggregate any of the information we collect (so that it does not directly identify you). We may use anonymized information for purposes that include testing our IT systems, research, data analysis, improving our site and developing new products and features.</p>

<h3>LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES</h3>
<p class="p-empty">Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from third-party websites of our partner networks, advertisers, partner merchants, news publications, distributors and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies.

<h3>INCORPORATION OF SERVICES AND CONTENTS FROM THIRD PARTIES INTO OUR WEBSITES</h3>
<p class="p-empty">Content of third parties, such as videos from YouTube, RSS feeds or graphics from other websites, are or will be integrated into our site. This may require that the providers of the content ("<span style="text-decoration:underline">third-party provider</span>") will process the IP address or other Personal Information about you. Without this information the third-party provider may not be able to provide content for you to view or use. Where an IP address or other Personal Information is necessary for showing the third-party provider’s content, we try to use content only from those providers that use the IP address or other Personal Information only for the delivery of such content. However, we have no influence on whether or not the third-party provider will save the IP address or other Personal Information for their own use, e.g. for statistical purposes.</p>
<h3>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h3>

When we change this privacy policy in a material way, we will update the "last modified" date at the top of this privacy policy.

We will usually do this through email or by placing a notice on our site. The fact that we may send notices to you will not stop you from being able to opt out of certain types of contact as described in this privacy policy.</p>
