### Personal Information

We collect personally identifiable information from you when you register to use the Website, when you submit contributions or tasting notes, when you participate in any forums, when you make voluntary payment to CellarTracker, or when you request customer support or send us e-mail (“Submissions”).  If you submit Submissions or information, we collect identifiable information about you and your authorized users such as your name, user ID, and email address and may collect telephone numbers, billing information, and demographic information such as age, gender and zip code (“Personal Information”). We also collect and store information that you enter into this Website or that you provide to any of our representatives, or in conjunction with requests for more information. Registration may also be required and Personal Information may also be collected if there are certain portions of the Website in which you specifically and knowingly provide such information, e.g. community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards, blog comments, if any).  We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources such as 3rd party wine reviewers that you subscribe to, to enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database. Generally speaking, your personal information is never exposed on the website, but if you register on the Forum or on the website, you have control over your profile and what information is shown.

In addition, when you interact with the Website, our servers may keep an activity log that does not identify you individually (“Anonymous Information”).

### Use of Cookies and Spyware

We never use or install spyware on your computer, nor do we use spyware to retrieve information from your computer.  Like many Websites, we use “cookies”, which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences. We use cookies to track use of our Website and online services. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Website and make it easier and/or relevant for your use.  We may also use Flash cookies, Javascript and other techniques to fingerprint you and prevent automated scraping of information from the Website. You may occasionally get cookies from companies advertising on our behalf (Google) or from companies (Quantcast) we use to monitor site traffic. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to this cookie policy. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies, but cookies are required in order to log into the Website or forum. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.

### Is Information Collected From Children?

This is not a Website directed to children under the age of 13, and CellarTracker does not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age you should not use this Website, and under no circumstance should you provide personally identifiable information to CellarTracker. If CellarTracker discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided CellarTracker with personally identifiable information, CellarTracker will immediately delete that child’s information from the Website.

### How We Use Your Information?

We use the information we learn from you to help us personalize and continually improve your experience on the Website.  We use the information to communicate with you about products, services, promotional offers, update our records and generally maintain your relationship with us.  We also use this information to enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.

### Use of Anonymous Information

We use Anonymous Information to help us determine how people use parts of the Website and who our users are so we can improve our Website and ensure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many people as possible.  We also use Anonymous Information to provide statistical "ratings" information in aggregated form to our partners and other third parties about how our users collectively use the Website. We may also use or share Anonymous Information (or other information, other than Personal Information) in any other manner that we deem appropriate or necessary.

### Third-Party Agents

We occasionally have third party agents, affiliates and partners that perform functions on our behalf, such as analytics or anti-scraping prevention, etc.  These entities have access to the subset of Personal Information needed to perform their functions and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that Personal Information. They are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to the Website.

### Transactional Partners

We may share non-personal information with our partners and others from time to time. Examples of such non-personal information include the number of users who visited this Website during a specific time period. This information generally is shared in an aggregated form.

### Emergency Situations

We may also use or disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or the Website; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Website or our users, and (c) act under emergency circumstances to protect the our personal safety or the personal safety of our affiliates, agents, the users of the Website, or the public.

### What Steps Are Taken To Keep Personal Information Secure?

The importance of security for all Personal Information associated with you is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers.  Personal Information collected by our Website is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public.  To the extent that you make a voluntary payment, this is typically either done using Payflow Link or PayPal, and we do not have direct access to your cardholder data. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you. While we try our best to safeguard your Personal Information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

### What Happens When I Link To or From Another Web Site?

The Website may contain links to other websites operated by affiliates of CellarTracker or third parties. Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy for CellarTracker do not apply to information gathered through these other web sites. These other sites may also send their own cookies to you, collect your data or solicit your Personal Information.  Always be aware of where you end up. We are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third parties and other websites.  We encourage you to be aware of when you leave this Website and read the privacy policies of each and every website that you visit.

### Governing Law/Assignment

The Website is published in the United States of America. We make every effort to protect the Personal Information of all users of the Website. We attempt to comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws to the extent they may apply to the CellarTracker services.  If you are uncertain whether this privacy policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy laws where you are located, you should not submit your Personal Information to CellarTracker.

As a result, please be aware that we may transfer your information to another CellarTracker that is affiliated with us or with which we have merged.

### Changes to This Policy

We are committed to maintaining our position as a premier Website on the Internet. As our Website continues to develop, we may add new services and features to our Website. In the event that these additions affect our Privacy Policy, this document will be updated appropriately.  We will post those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.  We do, however, recommend that you read this Privacy Policy each time you use our website in case you missed our notice of changes to the Privacy Policy.  We will never, however, materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information we have previously collected without your express consent.
