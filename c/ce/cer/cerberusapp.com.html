<div class="parag">REGISTRATION INFORMATION: You provide to LSDroid certain personally-identifiable information (such as device ID number, wireless operator / operator, your name, email address, etc.) when choosing to subscribe to the LSDroid Services.
<br>LOCATION INFORMATION: To provide the LSDroid Services, we derive location information from your wireless operator, certain third-party service providers, or directly from the mobile device that you used to register with the LSDroid Services.

<div class="title">THE WAY LSDROID USES INFORMATION</div>
<div class="parag">LSDroid uses your personally identifiable, registration, and location information to operate, maintain, and provide to you and other Users all of the features and functionality of the LSDroid Service.
<br>LSDroid uses your personally identifiable, location, and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous log file information) to track and analyze User preferences and trends in order to improve the quality and design of the LSDroid Services and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services.
<br>LSDroid uses cookies and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the LSDroid Services; (b) provide custom and personalized content, advertisements, and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; and (d) monitor aggregate usage metrics.

</div>
<div class="title">WHEN LSDROID DISCLOSES INFORMATION</div>
<div class="parag">LSDroid discloses aggregate, anonymous log file and usage information in reports to interested third parties to assist those parties in understanding the usage patterns and performance results of certain advertisements, content, services, promotions, or features. For example, we may provide aggregate-level reports to a partner for the purpose of showing delivery and performance statistics of a specific advertising campaign.
<br>LSDroid may release personally identifiable, registration, profile, or location information if required to do so by law.

<div class="title">YOUR CHOICES</div>
<div class="parag">You may update, correct, or delete your profile information at anytime. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.
</div>
<div class="title">OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY</div>
<div class="parag">LSDroid uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information that LSDroid receives on your behalf to operate the LSDroid Services or that you transmit to LSDroid and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, ethical, or managerial safeguards.
<br>If LSDroid learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. LSDroid may post a notice on the LSDroid Services if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
</div>
<div class="title">IN THE EVENT OF MERGER, SALE, OR BANKRUPTCY</div>
<div class="parag">In the event that LSDroid is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control so that the LSDroid Service can continue operations. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we will do everything in our power to protect how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used. You will be notified via notice through the LSDroid Services of any such change in ownership or control of your personally identifiable information.

In general, we only use your personal information in the manner described in the Privacy Policy in effect when we received that personal information. Your continued use of the LSDroid Services constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any future revisions. If we decide to change our privacy policies, then we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
<br>For revisions to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you and obtain your consent before implementing such revisions with respect to such information.
