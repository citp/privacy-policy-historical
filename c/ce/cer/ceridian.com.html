					<h1>Ceridian Website Privacy Statement</h1>

We adhere to the laws and requirements within the United States of America in relation to the processing of any personal data we obtain. Ceridian is a global company and operates a number of websites around the world.  Any information you submit may be sent electronically to a server hosting one of these websites in another country. By sending information to us and browsing this Site, you acknowledge and agree to the cross-border transfer of your information. 
<br>In this statement "we", "us" and "our" means Ceridian and "you" means the individual using the Ceridian website ("Site"). This statement describes the practices Ceridian has adopted with respect to user privacy at Ceridian websites. Should Ceridian need to collect your personal information, other than for processing of data as contractually agreed with our customers, we will advise you of the purposes for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information at or prior to the time of collection. Ceridian may otherwise revise its privacy practices from time to time without further notice.
<br>
<br><b>What happens to information entered on Ceridian websites? </b>
<br>Personally Identifiable Information is information about you, such as your name, Social Security Number, biometric identifier, address, user ID or e-mail address or other information that you may provide which is connected to you. Ceridian does not divulge, sell or share any personal information that you provide, including e-mail addresses or employee information, with any agencies or alliance partners. Ceridian may, from time to time, use personal data that you provide, namely your e-mail or mailing address, to send you information about news, seminars and events that may be of interest to you. We do this to increase the value we provide to you. Should you no longer wish to receive this type of information, you will have the option, either by selecting options in our applications or by speaking with our customer care team, to indicate your choice.  
<br>
<br>Ceridian tracks and combines it's website traffic patterns. Ceridian may provide the statistics relating to traffic volume and traffic patterns to reputable third-party suppliers but at no time would these summary statistics contain personally identifiable information. We do not correlate this information with personally identifiable data about individual site visitors. 
<br>
<br>Ceridian reserves the right to co-operate with local, federal or national authorities or authorized investigative bodies in investigations of improper or unlawful activities, and may require the disclosure of personal information. It is Ceridian policy to comply with all legal, regulatory and contractual requirements associated with data and records retention. Additionally, it is Ceridian policy to dispose of data and records that have outlived operational usefulness and do not require retention by law, regulation, rule or procedure for other business purposes. Ceridian also offers web-based services to individuals, with hosting sites at various Ceridian locations. Information collected at these sites is collected for identified and specified purposes relating to the services being performed. 
<br>
<br><b>Consent</b>
<br>Ceridian, as a processor of information under contract with its customers, does not obtain consent directly from its customers' employees with respect to payroll or human resources information processing, fleet and gift card processing, electronic fund distribution and procurement or for other similar activities where Ceridian is acting as third party agent. All personal information received by Ceridian is provided by its customers directly and it is the obligation of the customers to have obtained appropriate consent, according to applicable privacy laws, from their employees before transferring, in printed, electronic, facsimile or any other format, personally identifiable information to Ceridian.

Our data is stored within a secure physical environment and internally, only authorized personnel who need to access this information to carry out our contractual obligations or to complete their employment duties can access this information. Ceridian personnel have been trained in security procedures, and comply with Ceridian's Code of Conduct. Security procedures are reviewed regularly and may change to reflect new enhancements in security practices or technology.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as 100% secure.
