### What Information is Collected

Cerner collects certain information from its users in three ways: (a) from Cerner web server logs, (b) with cookies and (c) directly from the user.

(a) IP Addresses (Server Log Information)

An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the internet. All computer identification on the web is conducted with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. Cerner collects IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, report aggregate information to affiliates, subsidiaries, sponsors, advertisers or partners, and to conduct site analysis. Cerner will also use IP addresses to identify any users who refuse to comply with Cerner's Terms of Use Agreement, and to identify users who threaten Cerner’s service, site, user, clients or others.

(b) Cookies

Cerner uses cookies as described in our cookie policy.

(c) Web Analytics

Cerner may use Google Analytics to understand Cerner's site usage. Site usage information is used to help design, develop, and support Cerner website. To the extent Cerner uses Google Analytics Google receives and stores Cerner's contributed site usage information (such as pages accessed), but it does not receive any individually identifiable or sensitive information as a part of this process.
