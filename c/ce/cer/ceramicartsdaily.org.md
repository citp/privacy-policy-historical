# Privacy Policy - Ceramic Arts Network

## Data Collection

When you register for Ceramic Arts Network, we collect only your name and email address. This information is used to personalize the site and to verify the member status of certain registered users. Registration is not required to browse the site.

We also log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which parts of Ceramic Arts Network you visit and how much time you spend there. **But we do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable.** The only other information automatically provided to us is the type of computer and operating system you are using. Your browser supplies us with this information.

Like many websites, Ceramic Arts Network uses cookies to help us personalize your browsing experience and to collect information about how you use the site.

Your email address may be used for weekly newsletter distribution and certain marketing emails sent by The American Ceramic Society (owner of the CeramicArtsNetwork.org), and its commercial vendors. You will always be provided with an option to opt out of any email distributions.

## Data Security

The American Ceramic Society is fully committed to data security. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information you provide to us online. However, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us. In this regard, we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data while you are on the Internet. At a minimum, we encourage you to change your passwords often, using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure that you are using a secure browser as you surf the Internet.

## Commitment to Privacy

The American Ceramic Society is actively committed to preserve individual privacy rights on the Internet and in all aspects of electronic commerce. If you have a question specific to privacy, please contact us at [editor@ceramicartsdaily.org](mailto:editor@ceramicartsdaily.org). If we decide to change our privacy policy, those changes will be posted on this page.
