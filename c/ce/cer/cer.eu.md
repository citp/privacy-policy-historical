We may also pass your information to other third-party service providers, agents and subcontractors for the purposes of completing tasks and providing services to you on our behalf.

 **Security precautions  
** Non-sensitive details (your email address etc) are transmitted normally over the internet, and this can never be guaranteed to be 100 per cent secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

 **Use of 'cookies'  
** Like many other websites, the Centre for European Reform website uses cookies. A cookie is a small text file passed to your computer, mobile phone or other device, through your web browser, so the website remembers who you are when you return.

The Centre for European Reform uses Google Analytics to track how this website is used. Google Analytics uses cookies to help gather statistics on how people use websites. For example, which country the user is from, and which pages are visited while on the website. We use this information to look at how our website is being used so we can assess how well it is working and to help us make decisions about how to improve it.

Cookies may also be used by some parts of the site where we utilise third-party services, such as YouTube and Vimeo for video content and SoundCloud for audio content.

If you do not wish to have cookies stored on your computer you can easily change your web browser to refuse them, or to let you know when you get a new cookie. You need to refer to your internet browser's instructions by clicking on the 'Help' menu. Refusing cookies, however, can restrict your use of our website.

 **Links to other websites**

Our website may contain links to other websites run by other organisations. This privacy policy applies only to our website‚ so we encourage you to read the privacy statements on the other websites you visit. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other sites even if you access them using links from our website.

In addition, if you linked to our website from a third-party site, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners and operators of that third-party site and recommend that you check the policy of that third party site.

 **Transferring your information outside of Europe**

Some of the information which you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside the European Union. By way of example, some Centre for European Reform events are held in countries outside of the EU. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK. By submitting your personal data, you are agreeing to this transfer.

If you use our services while you are outside the EU, your information may be transferred outside the EU in order to provide you with those services.
