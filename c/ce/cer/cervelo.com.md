# Our Philosophy

CERVÉLO PRIVACY POLICY
Our Philosophy
Cervelo SA (“Cervelo”) believes that having a relationship with our customers that is founded on
trust is not merely the law but also good business. We believe in giving full disclosure about the
kinds of information we gather and what we do with it. We are committed to ensuring that your
privacy is protected.
Cervelo is committed to protecting your privacy rights. To this end, we have prepared this
Privacy Policy to inform you about our ongoing commitment to ensuring your personal
information remains accurate, confidential and used only for identified purposes, regardless of
how it is provided to us. This Policy also addresses how you can inquire about the personal
information we hold about you and how we will respond to such a request.
What is “Personal Information?”
Personal information is any information that identifies you, or by which your identity could be
deducted. It does not include:
•   the name or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization;
•   corporate business contact information; and
•   aggregated information that is no longer related to a specific identifiable individual.
Cervelo reserves the right to use aggregated or anonymous information in any way it considers
appropriate.
Why Do We Collect Personal Information from You?
We collect personal information to
•   understand your needs when they are shopping for a high-performance bicycle;
•   track and identify market trends;
•   determine the credit-worthiness of a business or individual;
•   provide information to you about new bikes and products; and
•   inform you of exciting upcoming events.
Collecting your personal information helps us be a brand leader in bikes and provide you with
unparalleled service and support. We may at times collect sensitive financial, family, and
personal preference information from you, which helps us to better understand our market.
Having such information help us to design bikes that meets the needs of different market sectors,
which in turn will result in cost savings to you, the consumer.
At times Cervelo may require certain financial information to determine your credit-worthiness
as a distributor or as an applicant for credit. If you choose not to provide us with certain personal
information required for a product or service, such as to complete a purchase order or process an
application for credit we will advise you if the transaction cannot be completed without your
personal information.


CERVÉLO PRIVACY POLICY
What Personal Information Do We Gather?
The kind of personal information we will ask for includes your name, e-mail address, phone
number, address, type of business, customer preference information, customer number, as well as
such other personal information that is needed to fulfill the purposes identified in this Privacy
Policy.
When you apply for credit, Cervelo may ask you for financial information, which includes but is
not limited to:
•   estimates of annual sales;
•   the status and ownership of your premises;
•   your landlord’s name and telephone number;
•   trade references;
•   bank account and contact information; and,
•   copies of recent balance sheets and income statements.
We may also ask you for government identification as part of our application for credit. You
should know that most applications for credit have an impact on your credit rating as reported by
a credit bureau and by applying for credit, you expressly consent to the collection, use and
disclosure of your information to third party credit scoring providers.
How Do We Collect Your Personal Information
In collecting your personal information, we continuously strive to be in full compliance with the
Act and otherwise conduct our information collection with utmost care and concern for your
privacy. We may collect personal information directly from you when you purchase one of our
products, apply for credit, or in the course of our dealings with you. We may ask you to fill out
an online product registration card after purchasing one of our products. Sometimes we may also
obtain information about you from other sources, for example:
•   your landlord in an application for credit;
•   a government agency or registry;
•   your business partners; and
•   other individuals or organizations that you have given your informed consent for us to
    contact.
We may collect your personal information through the telephone, Internet, email, or paper based
forms. We may also send cookies to your computer which allow us to collect information
regarding your surfing habits and the websites that you visit within the Cervélo site.
Consent
Consent for the collection, use and/or disclosure of personal information may be obtained orally
or in writing and may be expressly given or implied. In determining how we obtain your consent,
we will take into account the sensitivity or the personal information about you that we are
collecting, using and/or disclosing.


CERVÉLO PRIVACY POLICY
When we use your personal information to provide products or services to you, including for
billing and credit purposes, and when we use your personal information to include you in any
direct marketing activities, we will assume that you have consented to such use unless you
specifically advise otherwise. If you tell us that you no longer wish to receive information about
our services, or about new developments, we will not send any further material.
Disclosure of Your Personal Information
Under certain circumstances, we may disclose your personal information when we are required
by law to do so or when you have consented to the disclosure. We also reserve the right to
disclose you personal information to third parties to help collect payment from you for any
product purchase or service. Your personal information may also be transferred to third-party
services providers for administrative purposes (e.g. credit bureau check or a computer back-up
service) and the third party is bound by our privacy policy. Public information about you may
also be freely disclosed.
Updating Your Information
Since we use your personal information to provide products and services to you, it is important
that the information is accurate and current.
If, during the course of your dealings with Cervelo, any of your information changes, please
inform us by contacting our Privacy Officer so that we can make any necessary changes.
Security of Your Personal Information
Cervélo takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that your personal information is kept safe
from loss, unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure. However, data that is transported
over an open network, such as the Internet or e-mail, may be accessible to anybody. Cervélo
cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted via the
Internet or email and if disclosing any personal information via an open network, you
acknowledge that it is potentially accessible to others, and may be obtained and used by others
without your consent. In particular, while individual data packets are often encrypted, the names
of the sender and recipient are not. Even if both the sender and recipient are located in the same
country data may also be transmitted via such networks to other countries regularly and without
controls, including to countries that do not afford the same level of data protection as your
country of residency.
Your data may be lost during transmission or may be accessed by unauthorized parties. Cervélo
does not accept any liability for direct or indirect losses as regards the security of your data
during its transfer via Internet. Please do not correspond or transmit data over the Internet if you
require a secure form of communication.

information) that we maintain about you, including financial information (such as credit card
information), unique identifier information (such as customer number or password), transaction
information (such as dates on which you made purchases, amounts and types of purchases),
contact information (such as name, address, phone number) that we maintain about you, and a

•    denial of access is required by law;
•    information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings against you; and

If we deny your request for access to, or refuse a request to correct information, we will provide

Retention of Your Personal Information
Cervélo keeps your personal information on file as long as is reasonably necessary for us to
complete the objectives set out at the time of collecting the information. When conducting
market analyses we may retain your personal information as long a reasonably necessary to
establish and identify market trends. In other circumstances, such as in an application for credit,
we will retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to complete our
dealings with you, or as may be required by law, whichever is longer.
