# Privacy Policy - Certify

**Privacy Statement**  
Last Updated: **11/1/2016**   
Certify, Inc. ("Certify") is the developer of certain web based software products and services. With all of Certify's products and services, Certify adheres to this Privacy Policy. Certify realizes how important the privacy and security of personal information is to its users. Certify's Privacy Policy applies to all of its users automatically. Certify works very hard to maintain the confidentiality of all data that is submitted to it. The use of information collected through the Certify service is limited to the purpose of providing the service for which you have engaged Certify.

**EU-U.S. Privacy Shield**  
Certify participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Certify is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework's applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield List.  
[<https://www.privacyshield.gov/list>]

Certify complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions. Per these Principles, Certify shall be responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf, in a manner consistent with the Principles, unless Certify proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Certify is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Certify may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

**Dispute Resolution**  
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that Certify has not addressed satisfactorily, please contact Certify's U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>.

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website [<https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint>], you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

**Information we collect**  
In order to provide its services, Certify collects various types of information, including personal information, about its users. When you sign up for a Certify account, you will be asked to provide basic registration information, such as user name, password, email address and SMS number. In some cases we require billing information, such as credit card information. Billing information is encrypted at all times and is stored on secure servers. 

Certify collects information under the direction of its clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. If you are a user with one of our clients and would no longer like to be contacted by the client regarding the use of Certify service, please contact the client directly regarding the issue. 

**Transfer of Information**  
Certify may transfer personal information to companies that helps it provide the service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the Certify Terms of Use Agreements entered into between Certify and its clients.

**Data Ownership**  
Any data you submit while using the Certify website or a Certify service belongs to you. You may remove it at any time.

Any information you submit that can identify you personally on a blog, bulletin board or chat room through the Certify website or a Certify service can be viewed and used by other Certify users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.
