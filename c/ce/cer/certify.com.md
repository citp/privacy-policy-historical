# Privacy Policy - Certify

We never share your contact information. We hate that too. 

**Privacy Statement**  
Certify, Inc. (“Certify”) is the developer of certain web based software products and services. With all of our products and services, we adhere to the following Privacy Policy. Certify realizes how important the privacy and security of personal information is to our users. Our privacy policies apply to all of our uses automatically. We work very hard to maintain the confidentiality of all data that is submitted to us. 

**Information we collect**  
In order to provide our services, Certify collects various types of information, including person information, about our users. When you sign up for a Certify account, you will be asked to provide basic registration information, such as user name, password, email address and SMS number. In some cases we require billing information, such as credit card information. Billing information is encrypted at all times and is stored on secure servers. 

**Cookies**  
Certify sometimes uses cookies to enhance our service. A cookie is a small data file containing a string of characters, which is transferred by a website to your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are used for a variety of reasons including security and to personalize our website for you. Our cookies never indentify you by your name or account number. 

**Log Information**  
While using the Certify website or a Certify service, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends. These logs may include information such as login and logout times, your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify you. 

**Communications**  
When you communicate with other users or our staff through the Certify website or via a Certify service, those communications are saved in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. 

**Business Partners**  
We offer some of our services in connection with business partners. In some cases, information you provide under your Certify account may be shared with our business partners to provide services requested by you. We process your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

Although we choose our business partners carefully, Certify cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of websites operated by third parties that are linked to or from our website. Once you have left our website, you should be sure to check the applicable privacy statement of the third party website to determine how they will use information they collect from you. 

**Protecting Your Data**  
Every precaution is taken to insure the security of your data while using the Certify website or a Certify service. We use industry-standard firewalls, secure web servers (https), data encryption and authentication procedures, among other techniques, to maintain the security of your data and your online session. 

**Using the Information**  
Certify uses personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. 

We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our services, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you. 

We may use your personal information to create anonymous data records or aggregations of data, to perform statistical analyses and for other purposes, by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to you. 

We may use or disclose your information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 

If we believe it is necessary, we will share your information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or the security of our network or services, violations of our Subscription Service Agreement, or as otherwise required by law.

We may transfer your information to a third party in connection with a sale or acquisition of Certify or all or substantially all of its assets, or in connection with a merger or corporate reorganization. 

**Data Ownership**  
Any data you submit while using the Certify website or a Certify service belongs to you. You can remove it at any time. If you ask us to delete your account, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to remove all of your data from our servers. Despite such removal efforts, portions of your data may remain on our production and back-up servers indefinitely.

Any information you submit that can indentify you personally on a blog, bulletin board or chat room through the Certify website or a Certify service can be viewed and used by other Certify users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Certify is not responsible for your disclosure of this information in these forums.

**Policy Changes**  
We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. You may review updates to our Subscription Service Agreement and/or Privacy Policy at any time via links on our website. You agree to accept electronic communications and/or postings of any revised Subscription Service Agreement and/or Privacy Policy on the Certify website, and you agree that such electronic communications or postings constitute notice to you of the revisions to the Subscription Service Agreement and/or Privacy Policy, as applicable.
