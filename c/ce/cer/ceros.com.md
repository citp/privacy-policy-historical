### 1\. Personal Information

When you request information about our products and services or sign up to receive information from us, you may be required to provide us with personal information about yourself, such as your name, company, title, address, e-mail address, and phone number. We do not collect any personal information from you when you access and use the Website unless you provide such information voluntarily. All information we collect and/or receive under this section is collectively called “Personal Information.“

### 2\. Other Information

In addition to the Personal Information, we may collect additional information (collectively, the “Other Information“). Such Other Information may include:

b. From Cookies and JavaScript Tags. Information that we collect using “cookie“ technology and JavaScript tags. Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer's hard drive so that your computer will “remember“ information about your visit. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to help us collect Other Information and to enhance your experience using the Website. If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer. Please consult your Internet browser's documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, the Website may not function properly. We use JavaScript tags to trigger a sequence of events that includes viewing a first-party cookie (or setting that cookie if it does not already exist) and to help us tailor and optimize our Website and provide you relevant CEROS advertisements outside of our Website.

## How We Use and Share the Information

We use the Personal Information and the Other Information (collectively, the “Information“) to administer our rewards and promotional programs; to improve our Website and services to you; to solicit your feedback; and to inform you about our products and services.

We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include providing technical assistance, customer service, and marketing assistance. These other companies will have access to the Information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law.

In an ongoing effort to better understand visitors to our Website and our products and services, we may analyze the Other Information in aggregate form in order to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Website and/or our products and services. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our products and services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

  * In order to provide our services and administer our rewards and promotional programs, we may share your Personal Information and Other Information with our third-party promotional and marketing partners, including, without limitation, businesses participating in our various programs.
