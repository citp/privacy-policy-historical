**_Your Information_ **  
When you make a purchase through the Website’s store, you are required to provide us with important personally identifiable information. This information includes your first and last name, your e-mail address and your method of payment, such as your debit or credit card data, so that we can charge you for your purchases.  We also need information for the shipment of your order, which may include your address and phone number or the name, phone number and delivery address of a third party recipient of your order.  
We also may obtain many of the same fields of personally identifiable information if you participate in any surveys or contests that CMI may sponsor.

CMI also obtains the name and e-mail address as well as other non-personally identifiable information from subscribers to the CMI monthly newsletter. This other information is used by CMI in order to send newsletters and announcements to subscribers, and is also used internally to analyze customer demographics.

**_Use and Sharing of Information_**  
We of course will use your personally identifiable information to charge or debit your accounts in payment for your purchases.  We will forward certain of your personally identifiable information to fulfillment houses, delivery services and other third parties who manufacture, distribute or otherwise provide the products that you purchase from CMI, as needed for the processing or delivery of your orders. We do not sell, rent or exchange your personally identifiable information to or with any third parties. 

**_Non-Personally Identifiable Information_**  
We may collect, create and share with third parties aggregated demographic and statistical information concerning both our customers and subscribers to our CMI newsletter.  This information does not reveal any personal information that can be identified with any particular customer.

CMI and third parties who provide services related to the operation of the Website may collect non-personally identifiable information, such as IP addresses, browser type, browser language, operating system and other aggregate information, when you interact with the Website. This information is collected in our logs for traffic analysis and Website optimization purposes (i.e. which pages are most viewed, high traffic times, page load times, etc.) The data is then used to improve the functionality and content of the Website.

You will obtain a password for future use when you first place an order through the Website store.  It is your responsibility to safeguard this password. 

**_Legal Requests_**  
CMI may access, preserve, and disclose your personally identifiable information if required by law or legal process or to protect the rights and property of CMI, its affiliates or the public.

**_Cookies_**  
CMI or third parties who are involved in the operation of the Website may place a small “text” or “data” file on the hard drive of your computer in connection with your use of the Website.  Cookies are intended to identify your browser when you access a service provided on the Website, and to collect and record information related to your use of the Website.  We also may use third parties to provide date collection and analysis regarding customer use of the Website.  To the extent that any personally identifiable information is obtained in these activities, we will treat it on the same basis as information derived from your purchases, as described above.

**_External Links_**  
The Website may include links to other websites. CMI is not liable for content and privacy policies on external websites.

For example, and without limitation, the Cesar Millan-branded services located at [**www.sessionswithcesar.com**](http://www.sessionswithcesar.com/), including the “Sessions with Cesar” materials, the “Cesar Live” webinars, the “Cesar’s Pack” community/forums and all other materials available on such web pages (collectively, the “Services”): (i) are not operated by CMI; and (ii) may be accessible from and provide links to other third party websites and access to content, products and services of third parties (sessionswithcesar.com, the websites referred to in (ii), and all other websites (excluding the Website) collectively, the “Other Sites”).  CMI is not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any of these Other Sites, and CMI does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services or content of these Other Sites or any other third parties. You should refer to the separate terms of use, privacy policies, and other rules posted on the Other Sites before you use them.

**_Your Security_**  
CMI takes the security of the information you entrust to us very seriously.  If you have any questions or concerns, please e-mail [**business@cesarmillaninc.com**](mailto:business@cesarmillaninc.com).

If you suspect that you may have been a victim of fraud, we highly recommend you immediately take the appropriate steps to ensure your security. If you have further questions or concerns on this matter, please contact [**reportfraud@cesarmillaninc.com**](mailto:reportfraud@cesarmillaninc.com) or visit the [**Watchdogs**](https://web.archive.org/web/20081218014636id_/http%3A//www.cesarmillaninc.com/contact/watchdog.php) page.  If we have reason to believe that the security of your personally identifiable information has been compromised through the Website, we will promptly try to inform you by e-mail at your e-mail address of record with us.  By use of the Website, you consent to the foregoing as the sole procedure to be employed in advising you of such an occurrence.

Your online security can be jeopardized as a result of tactics employed by third parties who try to deceive customers of legitimate commercial sites such as ours into revealing their personal information to the perpetrators for the purpose of fraud and theft.  These tactics, often referred to as “physhing,” may occur through two common methods:

  * _**False or “spoofed” sites**_ **.**   You may receive a fraudulent e-mail directing you to a “new,” fraudulent CMI website, or you may follow a link from a third party site to a “new,” fraudulent CMI website, or you may click on fraudulent entries that may appear from time to time on legitimate search engines.
  

  * _**Forged or fraudulent e-mail**_ **.**   You may receive a fraudulent e-mail that purports to have been sent by CMI or other perfectly legitimate e-commerce sites.  These e-mails seek personally identifiable information from you.  These e-mails often pretend to “update” your account information or claim that there is an amount in dispute or use similar pretexts, all intended to induce you to divulge your personal information, particularly credit card information or your date of birth and social security number (which can be used to create “identity theft”).



If you suspect that you have been subjected to any of these kinds of activities, you also should contact the Federal Trade Commission at _[**www.ftc.gov**](http://www.ftc.gov/)_ or phone 1-877-FTC-HELP.
