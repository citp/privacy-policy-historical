Safeguarding Your Privacy

**Privacy Notice**

It is City National’s mission to provide successful entrepreneurs and professionals, their businesses and their families with complete financial solutions on The way up®. An important part of this mission is protecting the privacy and security of our clients. At City National Corporation, we value our relationship with you and the trust you have placed with us. This notice describes how we manage and safeguard your information. Our privacy policy applies to all client information, including written files, client transactions and electronic services, by telephone and online. We appreciate your confidence in City National and we are committed to safeguarding your confidentiality and privacy on a daily basis.

**Our Commitment to Safeguarding Your Privacy**

Safeguarding client privacy is a top priority at City National.  City National does not share any client information among affiliates or with nonaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes unless you agree we may do so, or if you have expressly requested that we provide you with certain products and services.

As part of our commitment to safeguarding your privacy, we never sell any client information for any reason.  As a result, at City National, you do not need to take action (“OPT-OUT”) to prevent our sharing client information.  This will not change, even if you end your relationship with us for any reason.  We will continue to honor and safeguard any client information and preferences that you have shared with us.

**Information We Collect**

The information that we collect is used to provide you with the premier service you have come to expect at City National as well as helping to meet your financial needs.  In the process of serving you we collect and maintain the following client information:

  * Name, address, Social Security number (SSN), income and other client information you provide to us on applications or other forms, in writing, electronically or verbally.
  * Account balances or payment history and other client information about your transactions with us.
  * Information we obtain from consumer reporting agencies and from others with whom we work, such as publicly available information or demographics.
  * Password, Personal Identification Number (PIN) and other client information about you that we obtain in connection with our efforts to protect against fraudulent or unauthorized use of our services.



For certain applications, “cookies” may be used. Cookies are small pieces of information assigned by a Web server to the browser on your hard drive. Cookies help Web sites keep track of your preferences and recognize you as a return visitor. You may browse our Web site anonymously by choosing not to provide us with any client information during your visits. When you browse anonymously, we will not be able to link your online activity with the accounts you have with us. For all other Web sites you visit, please review their privacy policy before you accept cookies from them. 

**Managing Your Information**

To effectively administer and service daily operations, most financial companies need to share client information with the vendors to run everyday business. City National contracts with nonaffiliated third party vendors to provide services that include printing your checks, processing your account transactions and providing you with online products and services. Each vendor is required to maintain the confidentiality of client information and use that information only to provide the intended services(s). We disclose client information to these vendors to:

  * Establish, administer and manage your account relationships with us. 
  * Provide our services to you.
  * Process transactions and account statements.
  * Conduct research and analysis.
  * Deliver our other benefits and programs to you.



As permitted or required by law, City National may provide client information to credit reporting agencies; to others in response to subpoenas, other legal process, regulatory/administrative requests; and to government agencies in connection with suspicious or criminal transactions, including suspicion of elder or dependent adult financial abuse. However, we do not share client information from consumer reports or credit application without your consent.

**Protecting Your Privacy**

City National takes great steps to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of client information. We regularly validate our security measures through independent audits and monitor the security standards of our third party vendors. Within the bank, we limit the availability of client information to those authorized persons who need it to perform their job responsibilities, and otherwise as discussed in _Managing Your Information_.

Our Web sites use a full range of Internet security measures. The security architecture includes encryption technology, access control devices and firewalls acting as barriers between the outside world and the internal bank network, and trusted operation systems. City National uses anti-virus software specifically designed to detect and prevent computer viruses from entering our computer network system and continually monitors for attempts to break through our security systems. 

We have designed our systems to ensure that your PIN, password and other access codes are private and confidential. City National will never ask for client information through e-mail. Therefore, do not respond to any e-mail message asking for your password, PIN number, credit card validation code, bank account numbers, ATM, credit card numbers, SSN or other client information.

If you should receive an e-mail requesting such client information, please notify City National as soon as possible at (800) 480-5443.

City National will notify you about our privacy policy when you open an account and every year that you are a client. We will also notify you in the event that we change our privacy policy. Although we safeguard the privacy of all of our clients, this annual notice specifically applies to clients who are consumers.

**Safeguarding Your Own Information**

It is important that clients also take steps to ensure the privacy of confidential and sensitive information. Below are some examples of safety measures you can take to prevent unauthorized use of your personal information:

  * Review your statements on a regular basis. Immediately report any suspicious activity to City National.
  * Obtain a copy of your credit report on an annual basis. Review all the information to make sure it is accurate.
  * Avoid writing down your SSN, PIN or any account numbers.
  * Shred all documents containing personal information such as account numbers instead of disposing of them.



If you believe someone has unlawfully accessed your confidential information, please immediately notify City National at (800) 480-5443.
