# Canandaigua National Bank and Trust | Privacy Policy

### Canandaigua National Corporation  
Privacy Policy Notice

Canandaigua National Corporation recognizes its customers' expectations of financial privacy, and preserving our customers' trust is one of the core values of our bank and our family of financial service companies. For over 110 years, respecting and protecting customer privacy has been vital to our business. 

**Our Security Procedures**  
We are committed to the privacy of customer information and will use strict security standards to safeguard it. We restrict access to your personal and account information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. All of Canandaigua National Corporation and our family of financial service companies are governed by a code of conduct that includes the commitment to protect the confidentiality of customer information. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. 

We are equally committed to protecting the privacy of customer information on the Internet. 

### Internet Security at Canandaigua National Bank and Trust:  
What You Should Know

Protecting the financial transactions of our customers is of the highest importance for Canandaigua National Bank's Internet banking service. Canandaigua National Bank's security architecture uses several layers of technology to ensure the confidentiality of transactions across the Internet, but also depends on the vigilance of our customers in viewing their transactions and immediately reporting any discrepancies.

Security begins with your browser. To protect transactions, Canandaigua National Bank accepts Internet logins originating from a browser that supports a high level of encryption. Encryption prevents transactions from being "read" by unauthorized parties over the Internet. All logins to Canandaigua National Bank's web site are encrypted.

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol is used as the "pathway" to provide privacy for the data flowing between the browser and the Canandaigua National Bank Internet server. SSL provides a secure channel for data transmission over the Internet. It also allows for the transfer of digital signatures (see http://www.verisign.com) for authentication procedures and provides message integrity, ensuring that the data can't be altered en route. Canandaigua National Bank Internet customers can be assured they are actually communicating with the Canandaigua National Bank Internet server and not a third party trying to intercept the transaction on the Internet.

When a login is initiated, the browser logs on to Canandaigua National Bank's web site. A secure message via SSL is then initiated with a Canandaigua National Bank Internet server. The server responds by authenticating the customer and initiating session encryption. When a session is encrypted, the browser's icon indicating a secure session becomes activated. If the icon appears broken or not highlighted, encryption is not in use and the current session is not secure. 

Once the Internet session is securely established, Canandaigua National Bank's systems process and route transaction data using internal protocols. This prevents non-Canandaigua Internet traffic from proceeding past Canandaigua National Bank's series of firewalls and filtering routers. 

Customers must treat their Canandaigua National Bank Internet user ID and password with the same care as they treat their ATM or credit card PIN. In addition, a Canandaigua National Bank Internet user must make sure that no one is physically watching as his password is entered. If a user has logged into Canandaigua National Bank's Internet, he should exit the browser when leaving the computer unattended. 

Canandaigua National Bank will continually look for new advances in security technology and will modify its architecture to ensure that we provide the highest level of privacy and safety for our customers. 

**While Canandaigua National Bank and Trust takes prudent safety measures to provide Internet and other electronic services, it is incumbent upon customers to reconcile their statements or other bank communications upon receipt (or viewing), and report immediately any questionable activity. In addition, all passwords or other codes must be protected from any source that would compromise your privacy.**
