<p><b>CNBC.com ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY Statement.</b><br>
<b>This is the CNBC.com web site (the "Site").</b><br> Our postal address is<br>
<br> 2200 Fletcher Avenue<br> Ft. Lee, NJ 07024<br>
<br> We can be reached via e-mail at <a href="mailto:questions@online.cnbc.com">questions@online.cnbc.com</a><br> The policies below are applicable to CNBC.com.</p>
<p><b>CNBC.com’s Privacy Policy</b><br> Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operation of CNBC.com, we gather certain types of information about CNBC.com users, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how to correct or change the information.</p>
<p><b>Information Collected By CNBC.com</b><br> CNBC.com collects two types of personally identifying information from users: personal information (such as names and e-mail addresses); and aggregated information (such as information about traffic patterns on CNBC.com, for example how many users log into CNBC.com on a daily basis).</p>
<p><b>Personal Information</b><br> Personal information is collected when users provide personal information to CNBC.com, for example in registering for electronic newsletters or other membership services, creating a personal portfolio, answering surveys, purchasing items from CNBC.com, and registering for contests and other promotional opportunities provided by CNBC.com. Also, we collect the e-mail addresses of users who post messages to our message boards and chat areas.</p>
<p><b>Aggregated Information</b><br> Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or site registrations, is collected through various methods. For example, CNBC.com collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from CNBC.com, our servers log your IP address. CNBC.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to provide aggregated data to advertisers about the volume of use on CNBC.com.</p> <p><b>Use of Cookies</b><br> CNBC.com uses "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow CNBC.com to measure activity on the Site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the Site without re-registering. Cookies are used by CNBC.com to measure activity on the Site and make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not. CNBC.com does not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except for personal information voluntarily provided by you (i.e., during membership registration or a contest), CNBC.com does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the Internet industry. CNBC.com does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to CNBC.com's privacy policies. CNBC.com uses Engage and Doubleclick, to sell advertising and marketing on CNBC.com. Doubleclick collects internet information about your internet browser (for example Netscape or Internet Explorer), browser language, numerical IP address, domain type from which the user originates (for example, .com or .org), your service provider and other clickstream data. If you do not wish to receive cookies from Doubleclick, please visit the Doubleclick site at <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy/" target="_top">http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy/</a>. Engage also collects aggregated information, including IP addresses, from CNBC.com users by the use of cookies. If you would like to know more about Engage's privacy policy and management of personal information, please go to <u><font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://www.engage.com/privacy/faq_privacy.cfm" target="_top">http://www.engage.com/privacy/faq_privacy.cfm </a></font></u>".</p> <p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the Site, such as the member-only areas and shopping, contest and game areas, will not function properly if you do so.</p>
<p><b>Use of Information Collected by CNBC.com</b><br> CNBC.com uses both the personal and aggregated information that we collect for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Site for each individual user and to notify users about updates to the Site or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you.</p>
<p>CNBC.com shares aggregated information with third parties for both advertising and promotional purposes.</p>
<p>CNBC.com may also share personal information with prescreened third parties for marketing or promotional purposes. CNBC may also disclose personal information, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is legally required, to protect our rights or the safety of others. CNBC.com will undertake to provide users with an opportunity to decline this service when such information is requested from you online. If you object to CNBC.com's use of personal information provided by you for any reason, you may stop that use by modifying your registration information online. Once you are logged in, you can change or delete your registration information by returning to: <a href="javascript:registration()">Registration</a> , unchecking the relevant boxes or deleting the relevant data and then clicking "submit."</p>  <p>Also, if you have registered as a member through our online registration system and have subscribed to one or more of our e-mail newsletters and do not want to receive such e-mail newsletter(s) from us in the future, please discontinue your subscriptions by returning to: <a href="javascript:calleditprofile()">Edit Profile</a> , and then clicking "unsubscribe." </p>
<p>In addition, in the event CNBC.com plans to post any such information on the Site, CNBC.com will undertake to notify you of this possibility when you provide the information or, if possible, will notify you when the information is posted.</p>
<p><b>Children and Privacy</b><br> CNBC.com encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online, and to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children. At various places on CNBC.com, we will ask whether users are under the age of 18, or 13, for example when requesting personal information from users, or CNBC.com may ask for parental consent. However, while CNBC.com requests this information or permission, CNBC.com relies on users to be truthful in responding to these questions.</p> <p><b>Individuals Under 13</b><br> No information should be submitted to or posted on the Site by users under the age of 13 years without the consent of their parent or guardian. CNBC.com does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever unless disclosed during collection. Users under the age of 13 are generally asked not to participate in contests or other promotional opportunities.</p>
<p><b>Individuals 13 Through 17</b><br> CNBC.com requests that children under the age of 18 do not submit or post information to the Site without a parent or guardian’s consent. CNBC.com may collect information, including personally identifying information, from users between the ages of 13 and 17. With the permission of their parent or guardian this information may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by CNBC.com and may be shared with prescreened third parties. If a user or their parent or guardian changes their mind with respect to such use, such user, parent or guardian may stop that use -- either by e-mail request or by modifying his/her registration information online as described above in "Use of Information Collected by CNBC.com".</p>
<p><b>Message Boards and Chat</b><br> Please remember that information posted to message boards and chat areas becomes public information. Use caution when posting. Users under the age of 18 should be especially careful not to provide any personally identifying information while using chat rooms or message boards. As set forth in CNBC.com’s Usage Agreement, users of chat areas and message boards must follow acceptable standards of behavior when posting messages online.</p>
<p><b>Links to Other Sites</b><br> It is important to note that CNBC.com contains links to sites other than CNBC.com, and that those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as CNBC.com. For instance, if you click on an advertisement on CNBC.com, this will take you away from CNBC.com to an entirely different site. This can include links from advertisers, content providers and partners who may use CNBC.com’s logo and or style as a result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to you, and may collect information and make uses of it that CNBC.com would not.</p>
<p><b>USE OF THIS SITE SIGNIFIES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE USAGE AGREEMENT.</b><br> CNBC.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time by posting a revised privacy policy online. You can send e-mail to us with any further questions at <a href="mailto:questions@online.cnbc.com">questions@online.cnbc.com</a></p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" width="750"><tbody><tr><td><div align="center" valign="top">
