**Do Not Track**

| 

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers that allows them to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. When a user activates DNT, the browser sends a message requesting that the website or online service not track the user. At the present time, standard DNT technology is not yet finalized and not all browsers support DNT; therefore, the Company does not recognize DNT signals. Instead, information collection and disclosure practices and the choices that the Company provides to users will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not a DNT signal is received.  
  
**Why can’t I limit all sharing?**

Federal law gives you the right to limit only
