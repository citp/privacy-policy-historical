### What information do we collect about you

In general you can visit CND's website without disclosing any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may request information from you. We collect information from our users at several different points on our website

We collect information about you when you become a supporter, place an order for our products, interact with our social media tools. Website usage information may be collected using cookies.

### How will we use the information about you?

We collect information about you to manage our relationship with you, process any orders and, if you agree, to email you campaigning information we think may be of interest to you.

Occasionally your Regional or Local CND group may request contact details of CND members in their area to publicise specific CND events and information. All CND groups follow data protection guidelines. If you would prefer to be excluded from these local mailings, please contact us so we can ensure your details are not shared.

We may use your information collected from the website to personalise your repeat visits to our website.

We do not currently engage in reciprocal mailings. We have an opt-out mechanism for members who do not wish their details to be passed on to third parties in future, please email [membership@cnduk.org](mailto:membership@cnduk.org) or write to CND Membership Team, Mordechai Vanunu House, 162 Holloway Road, London, N7 8DQ for more details.

### Access to your information and amending your information

If you would like a copy of some or all of the personal information we hold about you, please email [enquiries@cnduk.org](mailto:enquiries@cnduk.org)or write to us at CND, Mordechai Vanunu House, 162 Holloway Road, London, N7 8DQ. We may make a small charge for this service.

We want to make sure that your personal information is accurate and up to date. You may ask us to correct or remove information you think is inaccurate.

### Cookies

Cookies are text files, used by your computer's browser, that store visitor session data. Cookies, by themselves, do not identify the individual user. Cookies are commonly used on the Internet and do not harm your system. If you want to know more about cookies please go to www.allaboutcookies.org which explains how cookies work and how you can manage their use.

We currently use cookies to collate general management data which is used to plan enhancements to our services. Some cookies are external managed e.g. GoogleAnalytics, and are covered by their own privacy policies.

CND never stores any personal information in cookies (on any computer that you may use) that can be used to identify you, such as your name or account numbers.

If you do not want us to use cookies you may be able to configure your browser not to accept them. Please refer to your browser's 'help' facility for further information. However, in a few cases some of our website features may not function as a result.

### Other websites

Our website – www.cnduk.org – contains links to other websites. This privacy policy only applies to our website so when you link to other websites you should read their own privacy policies.

### Transfer of your data internationally

Our primary web server is located in the UK, however certain processes may mean your information may be stored and processed in and transferred between other countries. Information which you provide may be transferred to countries, including the United States of America, which do not have data protection laws equivalent to those in force in the European Economic Area. The information you enter with the explicit agreement of it being made public (such as petition signatures, comments etc.) will be made publicly available to the whole internet community and therefore may be transferred to any country

### Changes to our privacy policy

We keep our privacy policy under regular review and will place any updates on this webpage [www.cnduk.org/privacy]. This privacy policy was last updated on 4 July 2011.
