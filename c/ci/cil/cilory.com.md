### **Legal issues**

  * Just in case, a transaction is involved in a legal dispute (usually credit card fraud), information might be requested from us in form of a sub-poena (legal demand for information or appearance). In such cases, we might be required to furnish requisite information. In case this occurs, our policy is to first contact the customer (through preferred medium chosen by the customer) to inform them of our legal obligations.
  * These issues are not common and generally happen in case of credit card frauds. Hence, such information sharing would help in protecting your account and business with us.

  * Our payment gateway provider is [EBS(www.ebs.in)](http://www.ebs.in/), which has a history of managing millions of secure payment transactions.
