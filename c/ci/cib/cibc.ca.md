How we use information

We may use information for the following purposes:

  * Provide you with our digital products, services and support
  * Communicate with you, including providing alerts that you have requested
  * Personalize your user experience including offering you personalized marketing and offers
  * Better understand your interest in other CIBC products and services

Using third-party cookies, CIBC, its partners and service providers may market CIBC products, services or community initiatives on another company's site (e.g., remarketing). In some cases, the content of this marketing may be based on information we know about you, such as your browsing behavior on CIBC sites and third-party sites where you are shown CIBC ads, your CIBC products and services, and the information you have provided to us. If you access one of these marketing ads, we may also track the response rate, the specific CIBC ad that you selected and the site activity associated with each marketing ad. If you enter a third-party site which has a CIBC ad, we may use cookies to help us identify the site you accessed, but we do not track and create a profile of a user’s behaviour on that site. The response rate data is used to help us plan future online marketing campaigns.

CIBC may offer mobile applications or services that use location information. If you choose to use such applications or services, CIBC may, if your geolocation device settings allow us, collect information about your location to provide you with the applications or services you request.

We may also use location information to personalize your user experience including through site or mobile app content, marketing, or offers for products and services. For example, we may use general geographical location derived from your IP address (e.g., city) to customize CIBC site pages for you.

Some services may involve access to information on your device. For example, accessing your contact list can make it easier to use _Interac_ ® e-Transfer banking services, or accessing your photos and camera can make it easier to complete a remote cheque deposit on your mobile device. Some services may allow your device and your wearable to communicate with a CIBC app, such as for Apple Watch®.

Protecting your personal information

Protecting the security of your personal information and the financial transactions you conduct online is of utmost importance. We use multiple layers of protection when you access any of our digital products or services, such as digital banking, including:

  * **Web browser encryption:**  all browsers supported by CIBC digital services offer industry standard encryption. This provides a high level of protection for transmitting confidential data over the Internet.
  * **Firewalls:**  we have secure firewalls designed to prevent unauthorized access to our systems.
  * **Monitoring:**  we monitor activity on CIBC digital services to enhance security and to protect your personal information.



CIBC sites may contain links to non-CIBC sites. CIBC is not responsible for the information and privacy practices of these third-party sites. We recommend that you read any such third-party site's privacy policy to learn about its information and privacy practices before you provide any personal information.

##   
Web technologies

CIBC uses various web technologies, including web beacons and cookies.

Web beacons are tiny graphic images we may place on our site pages or in our emails. They may be used to measure such things as response rates to our communications and to help us improve our web pages and promotions.

A cookie is a small file created by a web browser on your computer when you visit a site or a particular page on a site. Cookies collect and store information based upon browsing patterns or information you provide. CIBC uses the following types of cookies on its sites:

  * **Session cookies**  are used during a single site visit and are automatically deleted from your computer when you leave the site. Session cookies perform several critical functions on CIBC sites. For example, they protect your security while you are using digital banking by ensuring that your session is secure while you are signed on. They are also used to ensure that you do not pay the same bill twice during a single banking session.
  * **Persistent cookies**  are used to track site activity over a longer period and remain on your computer until either you choose to delete them or they expire. They are used for a number of purposes on CIBC sites. For example, persistent cookies are used: 
    * To save your CIBC digital banking personal preferences. You must allow persistent cookies if you want your browser to remember such things as your card number, your language preference or your default home page each time you sign on to our digital banking.
    * To collect information about how visitors use our sites (e.g., use of our online tools and services such as retirement calculators) including browsing behaviour. For example, we may measure and track CIBC web and mobile pages viewed or how you came to our sites (e.g., which CIBC online marketing ad you selected, the address of the site that you came from, the sites you are accessing that have CIBC ads, or keywords you searched to find our site).



We may use this information to improve our service, provide a better experience for visitors to our sites and deliver online personalized marketing and offers.

  * **Flash cookies or "locally shared objects"**  are generally used to employ flash or multimedia technology (e.g., video). Software applications may create Flash cookies to store configuration information on your computer so that you may view rich media, such as Flash enabled videos, on CIBC sites. Certain CIBC online tools, such as mortgage calculators, use Flash cookies to retain information inputted by you (e.g., mortgage amount and interest rate), so that you do not need to re-enter this information the next time you use the tool.
  * **Third-party cookies**  are cookies of third-parties that CIBC has permitted to be created when you visit a CIBC site and are used by CIBC for the purposes of CIBC marketing on other companies' sites or to track the effectiveness of such marketing.
