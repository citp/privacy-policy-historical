##   
Web technologies

CIBC uses various web technologies, including web beacons and cookies.

Web beacons are tiny graphic images we may place on our website pages or in our emails. They may be used to measure such things as response rates to our communications and to help us to improve our web pages and promotions.

A cookie is a small file created by a web browser on your computer when you visit a website or a particular page on a website. Cookies collect and store information based upon browsing patterns or information you provide. CIBC uses the following types of cookies on its websites:

  * **Session cookies**  are used during a single website visit and are automatically deleted from your computer when you leave the site. Session cookies perform several critical functions on CIBC websites. For example, they protect your security while you are using CIBC Online Banking by ensuring that your session is secure while you are signed on. They are also used to ensure that you do not pay the same bill twice during a single banking session.
  *  **Persistent cookies**  are used to track website activity over a longer period and remain on your computer until either you choose to delete them or they expire. They are used for a number of purposes on CIBC websites. For example, persistent cookies are used:
    * To save your CIBC Online Banking personal preferences. You must allow persistent cookies if you want your browser to remember such things as your card number, your language preference or your default home page each time you sign on to CIBC Online Banking.
    * To collect information about how visitors use our websites (e.g., use of our online tools and services such as retirement calculators) including browsing behaviour. For example, we may measure and track CIBC webpages viewed or how you came to our websites (e.g., which CIBC online marketing ad you clicked on, the address of the website that you came from, or keywords you searched to find our website).



We may use this information to improve our service, provide a better experience for visitors to our websites, and deliver online personalized marketing and offers.

  * **Flash cookies or "locally shared objects"**  are generally used to employ flash or multi-media technology (e.g., video). Software applications may create Flash cookies to store configuration information on your computer so that you may view rich media, such as Flash enabled videos, on CIBC websites. Certain CIBC online tools, such as mortgage calculators, use Flash cookies to retain information inputted by you (e.g., mortgage amount, interest rate), so that you do not need to re-enter this information the next time you use the tool.
  *  **Third Party Cookies**  are cookies of third parties that CIBC has permitted to be created when you visit a CIBC website and are used by CIBC for the purposes of CIBC marketing on other companies' websites or to track the effectiveness of such marketing.
