## Cookies

We use cookies to provide some of the services available on Circuit Basics. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow it to) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as ‘first party cookies’), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (‘third party cookies’).

Both websites and HTML e-mails may also contain other tracking technologies such as ‘web beacons’, or ‘pixels’. These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way. As a result, if you disable cookies, the web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted.

We use cookies to:

  * Keep track of advertisements

### The Cookies We Use

We use cookies to keep track of advertisements, and to collect data about site traffic and site interactions. We do this to offer a better site experience, and to help improve the site.

 _ **Advertising**_

Advertising allows us to provide you with the content of Circuit Basics free of charge. Cookies help to make advertising more effective. Without cookies, it’s harder for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many ads were shown and how many clicks they received. The Google Ads we display on Circuit Basics use cookies to stop you from seeing the same ad over and over again, to detect and stop click fraud, and to show ads that are likely to be more relevant (such as ads based on websites you have visited).

Google stores a record of the ads we serve in thier logs. These server logs typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. This data is stored for a number of reasons, the most important of which are to improve Google’s services and to maintain the security of Google’s systems. Google anonymizes this log data by removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and cookie information (after 18 months).

The cookies may be set from a few different domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com, or the domain of our partners’ sites. In addition, Google may use cookies for ad measurement and reporting services. For more information about the types of cookies used by Google and thier partners, see their [Cookie Policy](https://policies.google.com/technologies/types).

 _ **Comments**_

These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. The comment author’s name, email address, and site URL (if provided during the comment submission) are stored in cookies. These cookies will last for one year. To learn more about these cookies, see [this page](https://jetpack.com/support/cookies/#comments).

 _ **Blog Subscriptions**_

For subscriptions to the Circuit Basics blog, functionality cookies are set for a duration of 347 days to remember a visitor’s blog and post subscription choices if, in fact, they have an active subscription. For more information about these cookies, see [this page](https://jetpack.com/support/cookies/#subscriptions).

 _ **Analytics**_

The service we use to track website views on Circuit Basics uses cookies to track how many times you have visited the site, how long you spend on the site, or what pages you visit. To learn more about these cookies, see [this page](https://jetpack.com/support/cookies/#stats).

 _ **Security**_

The website security service we use to protect our site uses several cookies to determine if someone is a human or bot, and to identify repeat visitors.

 _ **Affiliate Programs**_

Amazon may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects) for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits Amazon may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.

### How to Disable Cookies

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being downloaded, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.
