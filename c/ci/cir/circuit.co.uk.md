**3\. REASONS WE CAN COLLECT AND USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

The law on data protection sets out a number of different legal grounds upon which organisations can rely to allow the collection and processing of personal data. We rely on the following as set out below 

**Consent**

In some cases we will specifically ask for your consent to process your data e.g. by ticking a box or confirming verbally that you consent. In these cases we will always clearly explain what we will do with your data and will keep a record of your consent.

**Contractual Obligations**

In other cases, we will need to use your personal data to actually do what you are asking us to do and to perform our contract with you. E.g. to help with payment or card top up issues we will need your name and card number.

**Legal Compliance**

If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your data to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.

**Legitimate Interest**

In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests. For example, we will use your purchase history to send you or make available personalised offers that we think will be of interest to you and your business. We will also use your address and phone number to contact you with direct marketing information by post and phone, telling you about products and services that we think may be of interest to you and your business.

**4\. WHO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH**

We share your personal information;

With any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.

With selected third parties including:

Business partners, suppliers, and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you;

Website & app hosts and analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the operation, improvement and optimisation of our site;

We only allow our service providers to handle your personal information if we are satisfied they take appropriate measures to protect your personal information. We also impose contractual obligations on service providers relating to ensure they can only use your personal information to provide services to us and to you.

In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we will disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets. The recipient of the information will be bound by confidentiality obligations.

**5\. OUR MARKETING**

We may use your personal information to send you updates (by email, text message, telephone or post) about our products or services, including exclusive offers, promotions or new products or services.

We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal information for promotional purposes. This means we do not usually need your consent to send you promotional communications. However, where consent is needed, we will ask for this consent separately and clearly.

We will always treat your personal information with the utmost respect and never sell or share it with other organisations outside the group for marketing purposes. We do however work closely with our payment partner PayPal and from time to time we may carry out joint promotions to offer you discounts or savings or chances to win prizes. These communications may come from us or Pay Pal and whilst we will share information with them relating to the fact that you are a customer of ours, the personal data that they have about you will be information that they already hold as a result of you also being a PayPal customer.

You have the right to opt out of receiving promotional communications at any time by;

**6\. WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

Information may be held at our offices and those of our group companies, third party agencies, service providers, representatives and agents as described above. (See above “Who we share your personal information with”)

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, and processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. These transfers are subject to special rules under the applicable data protection laws as some non-EEA countries (such as the United States of America) do not have the same level of data protection laws as the United Kingdom and EEA. We will ensure that any transfer to one of these countries complies with data protection law. Our standard practice is to use standard data protection “model” clauses that have been approved by the European Commission. If you would like further information please contact us. 

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

**7\. H** **O** **W LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION FOR**

We will keep your personal information while you have a Circuit payment card or Circuit Mobile App Account which you continue to top up with us. Thereafter, we will keep your personal information for as long as is necessary:

To respond to any questions, complaints or claims made by you or on your behalf;

To show that we treated you fairly;

To keep records as required by law.

We will not retain your personal information for longer than necessary for the purposes set out in this policy. Different retention periods apply for different types of personal information. When it is no longer necessary to retain your personal information, we will delete or anonymise it.
