### Categories of Sources

We obtain the personal information of our users from the following categories of sources:

**I. Personal Data That You Provide To Us**

When you interact with the Website or the Service, CircleCI may gather information that, alone or in combination with other information, could be used to identify you (“ **Personal Data** ”), as described below. If you are an EU data subject, please see the “EU Data Subject” section below for information on your rights in relation to the Personal Data we hold about you.

**_a) Personal Data used to provide the Service and respond to requests_**

When users sign up for the Service, users are required to authenticate with their version control system identity (GitHub or Bitbucket). When users log in to the Service using sign-in services such as OAuth (for example, login with a GitHub account), these services will authenticate a user’s identity and provide the user with the option to share certain Personal Data, such as name and email address(es), with us. If you purchase one of our paid plans, we will also collect payment and billing information such as credit card details and billing address. We use this data to provide you with access to the Service and/or the Website, contact you regarding your access and use of the Service and/or the Website or to notify you of important changes to the Service. For EU data subjects, such use is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us.

On some sections of the Website, you may complete a web form to give your Personal Data to us directly, such as on our “Contact Us” page. We also collect Personal Data (such as your name and contact details, phone number) when you request information, including a product demo, ask to download content (such as white papers), register for a webinar or other event, or subscribe to email lists. We will use your contact information to respond to your request. For EU data subjects, such use is necessary to respond to or implement your request. If you send us a request or question regarding the use of the Service (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we may publish it (in anonymous form only) in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. 

CircleCI collects Personal Data that you provide through the Service only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with CircleCI, such as providing you with the Service and/or answering any requests regarding the Service as described above. You can always refuse to supply Personal Data, however doing so may prevent you from accessing the Service or engaging in certain activities on the Website or the Service.

**_b) Personal Data used to process applications for employment_**

When you submit a job application through the Website, we will collect your resume and any additional information that you elect to provide to us, including but not limited to employment history and education. We will use your contact details and data about your employment history and education to conduct job interviews, evaluate your application, and as is otherwise needed for recruitment. For EU data subjects, this use is necessary to respond to your request to process your application for employment.

**_c) Personal Data used for marketing_**

We will use your email to tell you about your Service usage, new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with CircleCI and our products, upcoming events or other promotions. If you change your mind about receiving information from us or about the use of information volunteered by you, please send us a request specifying your new choice. Please contact us as specified under the “Contact Us” section. You may also choose to opt out of receiving such emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, or by accessing the email preferences in your account settings page. If you download content from the Website, we may also use your phone number to contact you directly by phone, in connection with such new products and services, upcoming events or other promotions. 

Where required by applicable law (for example, if you are an EU data subject), we will only send you marketing information by email or mail, or contact you by phone, if you consent to us doing so. When you provide us with your consent to be contacted for marketing purposes, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by following the instructions to “opt-out” of receiving marketing communication in each marketing email we send you. In addition, if at any time you do not wish to receive future marketing communications or wish to have your name deleted from our mailing or calling lists, please contact us at [privacy@circleci.com](mailto:privacy@circleci.com). Please note that if you opt out from marketing communications, we may still contact you regarding issues related to our Service and to respond to your requests.

**II. Automatically Collected Information**

Like most hosted service operators, CircleCI collects information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site and the date and time of each visitor request and store it in log files. CircleCI also collects Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, which can be used to identify the location from which your computer is connecting to the Website, for providing the Service and for support purposes.

CircleCI also collects statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Website and the Service through cookies and similar technologies. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in the “Cookies” section below. CircleCI’s purpose in collecting such information is to better understand how CircleCI’s visitors use the Website and the Service and to improve your access to and use of the Website and the Service.

Use of such automatically collected information is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us, to the extent we process information that is needed for providing the Service and for support purposes, or is in our legitimate interest in understanding how the Service is being used by you and enhancing your experience on our Website and on the Service.

**III. Information We Process On Behalf Of Our Customers**

In providing the Service to our customers, we process on behalf of customers certain information that may include Personal Data, relating to customers’ employees, contractors or other users (“ **Users** ”) they transmit or otherwise submit to our Service. While our customers or Users decide what data to submit, this information typically includes email address and information relating to tests results.

CircleCI collects, aggregates, and stores metrics and data relating to, generated by, provided in connection with, or derived from customers’ use of the Service (“ **Usage Data** ”) in order to provide, maintain, support, enhance, develop and improve the Service and CircleCI’s service offerings. CircleCI will not disclose individual metric or usage data other than in an aggregated and de-identified form. For EU data subjects, this use of your Personal Data is necessary for our legitimate interests in understanding how the Service is being used by you and to improve your experience on it. 

## Data Retention

We will retain Personal Data that our customers provide to us through the Service for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

The CCPA temporarily exempts from these CCPA rights certain personal information reflecting a written or verbal business-to-business communication or transaction as well as data about CircleCI’s employees, job applicants, contractors, controlling owners, directors, officers and medical staff (if any) in their capacities as such individuals at CircleCI.

Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. You must contact the applicable business customers directly to delete your information that they have in their systems.

We may deny your deletion request or not delete some of your personal information, if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:

    * Your specific request (e.g., right to access, right to portability, or right to delete).



We will attempt to respond to a consumer request for access or deletion within 45 days of receiving that request. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.

Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.

## Privacy Shield

CircleCI complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks (“ **Frameworks** ”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the processing of personal data transferred from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S., respectively (for these purposes, reference to the EU also includes the European Economic Area countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). CircleCI has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (described below). If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the EU or Swiss Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Frameworks and to view our certification page, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>.

We rely on our Privacy Shield certification to transfer Personal Data and other information that we receive from the EU and Switzerland to CircleCI in the U.S. and we process this data in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice and Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, Recourse, Enforcement and Liability (“ **Privacy Shield Principles** ”), as described below.

**Notice And Choice:** This Privacy Policy provides notice of the Personal Data collected and transferred under the Privacy Shield and the choice that you have with respect to such Personal Data. It also provides information about other Privacy Shield Principles that are set forth below. When we process Personal Data collected through the Service on behalf of our customers, the customer will be responsible for providing appropriate notice and choice to its Users, as the customer controls the Personal Data it has submitted to our Service. Except as required or permitted by applicable law, we honor all customers’ requests from their Users to limit use or disclosure of Users’ Personal Data.

**Accountability for Onward Transfers:** We may be accountable for the Personal Data we receive under the Privacy Shield that we may transfer to third-party service providers (as described in the “Disclosure of Personal Data” section above) if they process Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles and we are responsible if they do so and for the harm caused.

**Security:** We maintain security measures to protect Personal Data as described in the “Security” section of this Privacy Policy.

**Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation:** We will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is reliable for its intended use, and that it is accurate, complete and current for as long as long as we retain it. We will keep your Personal Data only for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or for the duration required by law or our customer agreement, whichever is the longer.

**Access:** You have certain rights to access, correct, amend, or delete Personal Data where it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles. When we process Personal Data on behalf of our customers, the customer will be responsible to respond to requests for exercising your rights. We honor all customers’ requests from their Users to access, correct, amend, or delete Personal Data.

**Recourse, Enforcement, Liability:** In compliance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, CircleCI commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your Personal Data. European Union or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact CircleCI as follows:

  * **Email:** [privacy@circleci.com](mailto:privacy@circleci.com)
  * **Phone:** +1-800-585-7075
  * **Postal Mail:**  
Circle Internet Services, Inc.  
Attention: Privacy  
201 Spear Street, Ste 1200  
San Francisco, CA, 94105  




CircleCI has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>. 

If your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under certain conditions a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel. For additional information, please visit: <https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction>.

We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission with respect to Personal Data received or transferred pursuant to the Frameworks.

## Cookies

We and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to optimize the functionality of the Website, help us understand how the Website is used and provide you with interest-based advertising based upon a user’s browsing activities and interests. For more information about the cookies and similar technologies used on our Website, please refer to our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/legal/cookie-policy/) and [Security page](https://web.archive.org/security/).

## Links to Other Websites

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Website and the Service and not to any third-party sites or hosted services you may find or access through our Website. If you submit Personal Data to any of those sites or services, your information will be governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any site you visit or hosted service you use.

## Social Media Widgets

The Website and the Service may include social media features, such as the Twitter button, and widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Website or the Service. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

## Do Not Track

Currently, various browsers - including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to the websites visited by the user about the user’s browsers DNT preference setting. CircleCI does not currently commit to responding to browser’s DNT preference across its Sites and Services, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. CircleCI takes privacy and choices regarding privacy seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor the development around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard for DNT.

## Security

We take precautions to ensure the security of your Personal Data. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter your login information on the Service, all information to and from the service is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). For more information on our data security policies, please check [here](https://web.archive.org/security/).

That said, like any hosted service provider, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties or unauthorized personnel will not gain access to your Personal Data despite our efforts. You should note that in using the Website and the Service, your information will travel through third-party infrastructures which are not under our control.

We cannot protect, nor does this Privacy Policy apply to, any information that you transmit to other users of the Website or the Service. You should never transmit personal or identifying information to other users.

If you have any questions about security on the Website or the Service, you can [contact us](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us).

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, CircleCI may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in CircleCI’s sole discretion. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will either notify you by email (sent to the email address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on the Website and/or within the Service prior to the change becoming effective, or as otherwise required by the applicable law. We encourage you to periodically review the Website for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Website and the Service after any change in this Privacy Policy takes effect will constitute your acceptance of such change.
