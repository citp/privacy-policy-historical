**WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED**

Under the circumstances listed in the "How We Collect Information" section of this Privacy Policy, the following information may be collected:

  * **_Personal Information_**



To facilitate reading, the expression "personal information" is used throughout this Privacy Policy. For interpretation purposes, this expression shall have the meaning set forth in the legislation that is applicable to you. For instance, for legal residents of the European Union, “personal information” shall be read throughout this Privacy Policy as “personal data” as defined under the _General Data Protection Regulation_. In any case, we treat any information that makes it possible to identify you as an individual as personal information. For example, we consider your given name, surname, date of birth, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, mobile number, as well as any information that is considered personal information under applicable laws to be personal information.

We collect and process the following categories of personal information:

  * Contact information, such as your given name, surname, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address;

  * **_Information_** **_Collected_** ** _Automatically (‘usage information’)_**



We, as well as third-party advertisers, service providers and content providers, may use a variety of cookies and similar tracking technologies (“ **Cookies** ”) that automatically collect certain Website usage information whenever you visit or interact with us (" **usage information** ”). Usage information may include without limitation your information about your browser, operating system, all of the areas within our sites and e-mails that you visit, including content that you browse, and the time of day, among other information. Usage information may also include your IP address or other unique identifier (" **device identifier** ") for the particular device you use to access the Website. A device identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access the Website and our servers identify your device by its device identifier. Subject to applicable laws, some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access our Website.

Some usage information may be considered as personal information under certain laws, such as the IP address under the laws applicable in the European Union. To the extent that we combine usage information with your personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy.

Cookies can be used by us and by third parties for analytics purposes and to send you interest-based advertisements. Please read our [Cookie Policy](https://www.cirquedusoleil.com/legal/corporate/cookie-policy) to learn more about the type of technology used, the type of information collected, why it is collected, how it is used and how you can manage your preferences regarding the use of such technologies (including how you can opt-out of certain behavioural ads).

  * **_Information about someone else_**

You may have the right to object at any time to the use of your personal information for “profiling”. Please see “Your rights regarding your personal information” section below.

**PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THIRD PARTIES**

Our Website contains advertising and content provided by third parties who may associate themselves with us and other members of the Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group. Our Website also includes hyperlinks to such third parties' websites. These third parties have privacy policies that may be different from this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by third parties, whether through our Website or a third party’s website, remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We are not responsible for the manner in which your information may be collected, used, disclosed and otherwise processed by said third parties, and encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. To the extent we combine information we receive from third parties with personal information we collect directly from you on the Website, we will treat the combined information as personal information under this privacy policy.

**SHARING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

For the purposes outlined in the Privacy Policy, we may share your information with other companies in the Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group as well as with the different third parties listed hereafter, which may be located all around the world:

  * **Other parties with your consent:** If you have expressly provided your consent to receive information from other third parties that are not included in this list, we will share the personal information that you have provided with such third parties. Your personal information may then be used by such third parties in order to provide you with offers, products, promotions and services related to their respective activities or for any other purpose you have consented to;
  * **Business transaction:** We reserve the right to transfer your personal information without seeking your express permission in the event of a business transaction such as a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets. In doing so, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that your personal information continues to be used in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy;
  * **Legal or administrative bodies:** We may share your personal information with third parties (including legal or administrative bodies, governmental authorities, jurisdictions) if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce this Privacy Policy, to detect or prevent fraud, security or technical issues or to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.



Please note that once we share your personal information with an individual member of the Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group or with a third party, it may become subject to such individual member’s or third party’s privacy practices unless it is specifically provided for that the present Privacy Policy applies. Please note that we make commercially reasonable efforts to have your personal information used by such individual members and third parties in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

" **Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group** " shall mean Cirque du Soleil Holdings L.P. and its subsidiary, affiliated and parent companies, which may offer their products and services under various brands, including Cirque du Soleil, Blue Man Group and Creactive.

While your personal information will be collected and stored on servers in Canada and in the United States of America, it may be shared with, stored and/or otherwise processed by members in the Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group and/or by third parties who are located in other countries. For example, some of the service providers that process or handle personal information on our behalf are located outside of these countries. Regardless of where the processing of your personal information takes place, we will take steps to protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, data protection laws, and where required by applicable laws, recognised data transfer mechanisms (such as EU-US Privacy Shield Certification of third party service providers that we use or standard data protection clauses recognized by the European Commission). While we use reasonable means to safeguard your personal information, it is subject to the legal requirements and governmental authorities of the foreign jurisdictions in which it is located. For example, we may be legally required to disclose personal information to a governmental authority of a foreign jurisdiction in which your personal information is located.

**PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURITY**

We have adopted reasonable security procedures to help protect against loss or theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification to the personal information you provide to us. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any personal information you disclose or transmit on the Website and cannot be responsible for the loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification of your personal information, unless such acts are the result of our gross negligence or wilful misconduct, unless otherwise provided by law.

**RETENTION PERIOD**

We will retain your personal information only as long as is necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or for a longer period if required or permitted under applicable laws.

We may retain your personal information for an additional period in archive databases, including for the duration of applicable statutes of limitation in order to be able to exercise our rights and/or defend ourselves in case of legal claims.

Legislation in California provides that California residents are entitled to know how we respond to “Do Not Track” browser settings.

If we do so in the future, we will describe how so in an updated version of this Privacy Policy.

Legislation in California also permits customers who are California residents to request certain information about the sharing of their personal information with third parties or, in some cases, affiliates for those third parties’ or affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes.
