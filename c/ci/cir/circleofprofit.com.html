  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div>
    <p>Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet as
      enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of      information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence.</p>
    <p>      We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and
      security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects information from all
      end users of our Internet services (the "Services")-those who access some of our Services
      but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who may purchase Products and/or
      pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members")-what we do with the
      information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the
      collection and use of such information. We request that you read this Privacy Policy
      carefully. By visiting our Company Web site, you are consenting to our policy of
      collecting and using your data.</p>
    <p><strong>Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used</strong></p>
    <p>      Introduction. Our company collects information in different ways from Visitors and
      Members who access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites
      accessible through our Service.</p>
    <p>      Registration: Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when they
      sign up for our Products or Services including name, address, telephone number, billing 
      information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used
      to access the Services. The personal information collected from Members during the
      registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing<br>
      purposes). This information may be shared with third parties, as stated herein, or in
    special circumstances.</p>
    <p>      However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our Services,
      we may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and
      username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for
      the purpose of offering you other products and services.</p>
    <p>      We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information
      Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of
      Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and nonidentifying<br>
    information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.</p>
    <p>      Our Company collects personal information through forms you complete on the site, as
      well as but not limited to contests, sweepstakes, text messages, e-mails, faxes, telephone
      calls, postal mail or other communications with the user, as well as from outside sources<br>
    such as credit card processors and database vendors.</p>
    <p>      For example, when you fill out a form subscribing to our emails, we are sent data
      information from our autoresponder company such as your name, email, the website you
      signed up from, geographical data such as your city, state, Postal code, country, Latitude,<br>
    Longitude, Timestamp, Subscription method and IP address.</p>
    <p>      Also, with purchases, we supply our member's contact information, to our business
      partners, who then may contact the member by telephone after the member purchase.
      Sales proceeds are collected by the that business partner company. We also may supply
      other companies with contact information, for mail offers we believe would be of interest
      to our members, with or without compensation from those companies. At times we may<br>
      send an advertisement for a third party product, where we collect the sales proceeds, and
    forward the purchaser's information to that third party.</p>
    <p>      Our Company Partners and Sponsors: Some products and services may be offered to
      Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor seller or
      non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members some of these products and
      services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information.</p>
    <p>      Online Shopping: At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or register
      to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new product and service updates. In
      many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as your name,
      address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information.</p>
    <p>      If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a
      recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the
      recipient's name, address, and phone number. Our company has no control over the third
      parties' use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please
      exercise care when doing so.</p>
    <p>      If you order services or products directly from our company, we use the personal
      information you provide to process that order. We do share this information with outside
      parties that we do business with.</p>
    <p>      Online Advertisements: Our company may display our online advertisements. In those
      cases we share information about our Visitors and Members collected through the
      registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these
      advertisers.</p>
    <p>      Additionally, in some instances, we use this information to deliver tailored
      advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company
      tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the
      audience. Based upon the information we have collected, we may then display or send the
      advertisement to the intended audience. Our company does share personal information<br>
    about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies.</p>
    <p>      By visiting our Company Web site, you are consenting to our policy of collecting and
      using your data. If you do not want to consent to our policy of collecting and using your
      data you can “opt out” of our Social Network and Facebook.com Website Custom
      Audience Ads advertising policy by notifying Company in the following manner:</p>
    <p><strong>Social Network and Facebook.com Website Custom Audience Ads (WCA):</strong></p>
    <p>      A Custom Audience on Facebook.com is a list of people our company would like to show
      our ads to on Facebook.com, who have shown interest in our products and services, with
      ads we believe would be of interest to them. This audience consists of people, whose
      information and email addresses our Company already has, because they have already
      subscribed to receiving Company emails.</p>
    <p>      If you no longer have an interest in our products and services, you can opt-out of seeing
      Company's Facebook.com Website Custom Audience Ads. Unsubscribing from our
      Company's email list will remove you from Company's internal email database list and
      stop future emails from our Company, but not from being shown Facebook.com Website
      Custom Audience Ads. The Facebook.com Website Custom Audience Ads external
      database, is different from our Company's internal database and requires the following
      Opting-out request.</p>
    <p><strong>    Opting-out of Facebook.com Website Custom Audience Ads:</strong></p>
    <p>      To opt out of our Company's Facebook.com Custom Audience Ads, send an email, from
      the email address you are opting out, to Company using our email address provided in
      Company's contact information. Put "Opting Out of Facebook.com Website Custom
      Audience Ads " in the subject line of the email. In the body of the email include your
      name and email address. Our Company staff will forward your name and email address to
      Facebook.com with a request to delete you from all of Company's Facebook.com
    Website Custom Audience Ads.</p>
    <p><strong>Google.com Analytics</strong></p>
    <p>      Our Company may use Analytics tracking code to support Display Advertising, and
      enable Google Analytics to collect data about your traffic via the DoubleClick cookie in
      addition to data collected through the standard Google Analytics implementation. Display
      Advertising lets us enable features in Analytics that aren't available through standard
      implementations, like Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network<br>
      Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and Google
    Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.</p>
    <p><strong>Our Company may use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online:</strong></p>
    <p>      This allows third-party vendors, including Google, to show your ads on sites across the
      Internet. Our Company and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies
      (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick
      cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to our
      website.</p>
    <p><strong>Our Company may implement Google Display Network Impression Reporting or the
        DoubleClick Campaign Manager:</strong></p>
    <p>      Our Company and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as
      the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie)
      together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions
      with these ad impressions and ad services that are related to visits to your site. </p>
    <p><strong>Our Company may implement Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting:</strong></p>
<p> The data from Google's Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data (such as
      age, gender, and interests) with Google Analytics allows us to serve ads to you based on
    this data.</p>
    <p>    Opting-out of Google Analytics' For The Web and Google Analytics for Display</p>
    <p><strong>Advertising:</strong></p>
    <p>      Users can opt-out of Google Analytics' currently available opt-outs for the web at<br>
    <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a></p>
    <p>      Using the Ads Settings, users can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising
      and customize Google Display Network ads
      at <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/personalinfo" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/settings/personalinfo</a></p>
    <p><strong>Retargeting Ad Campaigns and Persistent Identifiers:</strong></p>
    <p>      Our Company may utilize various types of advertising that appear on our Company sites
      and services including ads on third party sites and services. Our Company may utilize
      categories of information, including names and email addresses, collected from users on
      our sites and services, as well as third party sites and services, in connection with the ads
      that are served. This advertising may include, but not limited to, contextual advertising,<br>
      cookies, anonymous cookies, pixels, persistent identifiers, geolocation information, email
    opt in, search engine terms, behavioral advertising and/or retargeting advertising.</p>
    <p>      This type of advertising is a form of targeted advertising, to the specific individual who is
      visiting the Web site. These advertisements appear on websites or other media, including
      display ads, pop up ads and ads displayed in mobile browsers. Those advertisements are
      selected and served by automated systems based on the interests relevant to the user from
      the content displayed to the user, based on what the user is viewing.</p>
    <p>      Our Company does not conduct inquiries into the information collection practices of third
      parties that may collect information from users that leave our Web site. Our Company
      may share customer information with third parties to process orders, for third party
      analytics and for marketing and advertising purposes.</p>

      company, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive.</p>

    <p>      We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer
      Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may
      have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age,
      residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic
      information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our
      services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, nonpersonally
      identifying information may be shared with third parties.</p>
    <p>      Special Cases: It is our company's policy to use or share the personal information about
      Visitors or Members in ways described herein without additional notice or means to opt
      out except as noted herein, or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
    <p>      Also, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information
      regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any
      reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: credit
      agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, or to satisfy
      laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act,
      regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose
      information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone
      who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, or other user
      policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect our company and our Members.</p>
