From time-to-time our site may request information from users via surveys or contests.

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

**Choice/Opt-out**

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt-out by replying with unsubscribe in the subject line.

**Notification of Changes**

CircleID Network reserves the right to change its privacy policy. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes prominently so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
