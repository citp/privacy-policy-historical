# Center for Internet Security

Thank you for visiting the Center for Internet Security (CIS) website.   
This website is intended to make it easy and efficient to learn about and interact with CIS and its four divisions: MS-ISAC, Security Benchmarks, Trusted Purchasing Alliance and Integrated Intelligence Center.

The mission of CIS is to improve and enhance Internet security, so we are sensitive to the privacy issues on the Internet and recognize that visitors to this website are concerned about the type of information we collect and how we use it. CIS is committed to preserving your privacy when visiting this website, and this policy discusses our practices.

This policy covers both: (1) personal information, which is information that can be identified to a particular individual because of a name, number, symbol, mark or other indicator; and (2) non-personal information that does not identify a particular individual. 

CIS does not collect any personal information about you during your visit to this website unless you provide that information voluntarily by sending an email or by initiating an online transaction, such as a survey, registration or order form. 

If you do voluntarily provide personal information, your email address and the entire contents of your email message and other information you provide are retained. Persons downloading or using CIS products are asked for certain personal information. We use that information in the list of CIS Security Benchmarks members that we publish on our website which, in the case of individual members, includes names and organizational affiliations. 

We assume when you provide personal information to us that you agree to its disclosure in connection with CIS activities. If you do not wish to have identifying information disclosed, we honor all requests to omit individual or organization names from website listings. If such a request is made, identifying information will not be disclosed by CIS unless we are legally required to do so.

If you do not use this website to request services or information, you may receive them by other means (such as through your membership in a group to which we may send correspondence). Your ability to view or download most information available to the public on this website will not be affected. 

If you provide personal information to CIS, our employees who have access to this information are required to follow appropriate procedures in handling and disclosing your information. All personal information about you or your organization that we receive via fax or mail is physically protected.  


In addition, CIS has implemented procedures to safeguard the integrity of its information technology assets, including but not limited to authentication, monitoring and auditing. These security measures have been integrated into the design, implementation and day-to-day operations of this website as part of our continuing commitment to the security of electronic content as well as the electronic transmission of information. 

We do not sell or distribute email addresses or other personal information to others for their commercial use.

We also collect some information that is not considered to be personal information. 

When visiting this website the following non-personal information about your visit is automatically collected and stored:

  * The Internet Protocol (IP) address and domain name of your Internet service provider. The IP address is the numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. It is used to direct information to your computer over the Internet. 
  * The URL (website address) of the website from which you linked to this site; 
  * The type of browser and operating system you use when you visit this site; 
  * The date and time when you visit this site; 
  * The webpage and services you access at this site; 
  * The forms that you download from this website.  




We use non-personal information internally to find out how people use this website, to help us understand which types of information are of most interest to our visitors so that we can improve this website's content, to assess system performance and to identify problem areas. We do not sell or distribute this information to others for their commercial use. 

We retain the information collected for a period of years and then destroy it.
