### **HOW WE COLLECT PERSONAL DATA**

CIEE receives personal data from multiple sources.  Most often, CIEE receives this data directly from you through our website or when you directly contact us. 

**Information you provide to us:** When you submit a contact form, create an account, or enter a search query on the Sites, you may choose to disclose information about you, including your name, physical address, email address, phone number, and date of birth, along with information regarding your interests, educational background, and interests relating to our programs. We collect information from you when you enroll our programs, when you contact or communicate with us (including through the website, by email or otherwise). We gather information about you when you provide it to us, or interact with us directly, for instance engaging with our staff or registering for our programs.

**Agents and or Independent Contractors:**   CIEE works with several third-party service providers who promote our programs to you.  When you submit your personal data to them for the purpose of enrolling or receiving information about our programs, they will forward your personal information to us for the purpose of offering you CIEE services. You should check the Agents or Independent Contractors for additional information on their privacy notices. We are not responsible for their privacy policies.

**Website Usage Information:** We collect information while monitoring our CIEE websites, when you provide it to us, such as when you use our website(s) or otherwise communicate with us (such as by email or via our social media pages).  The CIEE websites are: [www.ciee.org](https://www.ciee.org/ciee.org), [www.haesf.org](http://www.haesf.org/) and [www.balticamericanfreedomfoundation.org](http://www.balticamericanfreedomfoundation.org/) (the “Sites”). CIEE collects certain information automatically when you use the website, such as the IP addresses and domain names of visitors, browser type, history of pages viewed and other usage information about your use of the website. We collect this information for site administration purposes, such as to analyze this data for trends and statistics. We may share statistical or aggregated non-personal information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. This data is used to customize our website content and advertising to deliver a better experience to our users. Please see the section below on cookies for more information.

**Information that is automatically collected:** Like many websites, we use web analytics tools that rely on cookies, web beacons, and other automated tracking technologies (“Tracking Tools”) to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Sites, improve the Sites, personalize your Sites experience, provide you with information we believe may be of interest to you, and identify others like you who may be interested in our programs and services.

The information we collect automatically includes information about your computer and internet connection (including your IP address, operating system, and browser type) and details regarding your visits to our Sites (including your browsing actions and patterns and information about any referring website, search engine, social media platform, or link).  We do not use Tracking Tools to collect personally identifiable information (except to the extent you have provided such information to third parties, such as social media platforms – see section below titled “Information from Third Parties”), but we tie information that we gather using Tracking Tools to your personally identifiable information.

**Third-Party Tracking Tools; Google Analytics**

The Tracking Tools we use include services we obtain from third parties. The information generated by these analytics services will be transmitted to and stored by the third parties and will be subject to their privacy policies. We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies, how they may be used, or the information they may collect, and we are not responsible for these third parties’ privacy policies.

One of the third-party Tracking Tools we use is Google Analytics. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to [Google’s privacy policies](http://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&gl=us). Learn more about[ Google’s partner services](https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners) and how to opt out of tracking of analytics by Google.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

The Tracking Tools we use rely on cookies and web beacons:

  * _Cookies_. A cookie is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. Cookies are used to collect and store information, such as the type of computer you are using and how often you log on to a site. Our Sites uses both “session cookies,” to improve your navigation across the Sites and to remember you over the course of a single visit, and “persistent cookies,” which are stored on your computer until they expire or are deleted and help us provide better service to you over multiple visits to the Sites. You can always delete or disable cookies through your browser. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to sign in or take advantage of certain features of the Sites that require cookies.
  * _Web Beacons_. In addition to cookies, we deliver “web beacons” through our Sites and through emails we send you. Web beacons are small graphic images that may not be visible to Sites visitors that collect information about Sites usage on an anonymous basis. In some cases, anonymous data may be transmitted to third-party advertising networks. We use web beacons for our own internal analytics, to better understand the ways users interact with our website, and to determine whether a particular email was received and opened. We also use web beacons in connection with our marketing efforts. For example, web beacons allow third-party advertising networks to detect when a user has visited CIEE’s website, and then serve them ads for CIEE’s programs when they browse to another site.



**Information from third-parties and other sources:** We supplement the information we collect through the Sites with information from third parties (including our advertising partners and other service providers) and information we collect through other means, such as offline or through other websites. This information includes social media profile information, depending on the settings you have established for your social media accounts.

CEE may disclose or share personal information with its international affiliates for various purposes, as permitted by law, including in order for its affiliates to provide services.

CIEE may share some personal data with certain local and foreign third parties service providers who have a need to know and require your personal information within the scope of your agreement with CIEE,  for example, we may share your personal data with local and foreign government officials, agencies, consulate or embassies to process and facilitate your visa, host families, accommodation or transportation providers to arrange for program stay and logistics, universities to enroll you in programs, or potential local or foreign employers to facilitate internships or jobs.

We can disclose or share your personal data with lawful basis.

### PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA

We use security measures, in compliance with applicable law, to protect personal information from unauthorized access or use.

To safeguard against unauthorized access to personal information by third parties, all electronic personal information held by CIEE is maintained on systems protected by secure network architectures that contain firewalls and intrusion-detection devices. The servers holding personal information are “backed up” (i.e., recorded) on a regular basis in an effort to avoid any inadvertent erasure or destruction of such personal information and are stored in facilities with appropriate security and fire-detection and response systems.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.  Although we take measures to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its security.  Any transmission of personal information while using any of our online applications is at your own risk.  We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained online.  The safety and security of information also depends on you.  If we have provided you with (or you have chosen) a username and password for access to any of our online applications or websites, you are responsible for keeping such information confidential.  Please do not share your username and password with anyone.
