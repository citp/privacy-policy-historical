## Cookies & Web Beacons

A cookie is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain web sites. Cookies are used to collect and store information, such as the type of computer you are using and how often you log on to a site. This web site uses both "session cookies," to improve your navigation across our website and to remember you over the course of a single visit, and "persistent cookies," which may be stored on your computer for up to 30 days and which help us provide better service to you over multiple visits to our website.

In addition to cookies, we may deliver "web beacons" through our website or through emails we send you. Web beacons are small graphic images that may not be visible to Site visitors that collect information about the usage of the Site on an anonymous basis. In some cases, anonymous data may be transmitted to third-party advertising networks. We may use web beacons for our own internal analytics, to better understand the ways users interact with our website, or to determine whether a particular email was received and opened. We may also use web beacons in connection with our marketing efforts. For example, web beacons allow third-party advertising networks to detect when a user has visited CIEE's website, and then serve them ads for CIEE's programs when they browse to another site.
