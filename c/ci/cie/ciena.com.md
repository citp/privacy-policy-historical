# Privacy Policy and Terms of Use - Ciena

This privacy policy (the Policy) sets out how we, at Ciena, collect, use and protect your personal information.

We can collect your personal information when you:

  * browse our web site(s);
  * subscribe to our alerts and publications (including newsletters and mailing lists);
  * request information from us about products and services;
  * contact us with a question or complaint;
  * visit us at various industry events



**Collecting & Using Personal Information**

The information we may collect includes, but isn’t limited to your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. You can use our website without divulging any personal information. We do not collect personal information about you unless you expressly provide such information to us on a voluntary basis, for example, when registering or logging into our Support Center, subscribing to our investor distribution or one of our publications, or requesting more information to be sent to you about Ciena. We will only use your personal information for the purposes that you have provided it for or consented to.

We may also add the information you provide to our databases, subscriber lists and/or contact lists for general marketing purposes. When you submit personal information to you understand and consent to the transfer of your personal information to other companies within the Ciena group, which may include transfers across national borders and the storage and processing of your information in a country that may not provide privacy protections similar to those your country provides. Where such transfers are made, we ensure that the receiving party treats your personal information in accordance with this Policy and applicable law.

**Our commitment to data security**

To prevent unauthorized access and misuse of your personal information (including accidental loss, disclosure, alteration or destruction), maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate technical, organizational, administrative, physical and procedural security measures to safeguard and secure the information that we collect from you as described in this Policy.

We do not rent, sell, or share the personal information we collect about you with third parties or non-affiliated companies, unless we are required to by law, or in response to a government investigation.

To the extent that third parties assist Ciena in the provision of our website(s) or services offered on our website(s) (or otherwise), those third parties have no independent rights to your personal information, we make sure they have appropriate protections in place for your personal information, and only process your personal information in the way we have permitted them to.

**Non-Personal and aggregated information collected automatically**

When you visit our website, we log general data, such as your domain name, the name of the web page from which you entered our website, which pages you visit on our website, and how much time you spend on each page. We use this information to monitor use of and improve our website as well as for internal analysis. In particular, we use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the website, and gather information for aggregate use (IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information).
