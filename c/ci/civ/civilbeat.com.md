**Optional Information.** You may have the opportunity to provide us with additional, optional information about yourself. You may choose to do this because it enhances the Civil Beat experience for you and/or other Civil Beat users. This may include information such as: your zip code, a URL of your choosing, or some free-form text that you might want to include about yourself. We also give active members the ability to participate in discussions on the website. While we hope that you will consider being a constructive participant in these discussions, whether you decide to participate is entirely up to you. When you provide us this optional information, you agree and understand that this information may be made public to the entire world and that it is not entitled to the protections in this privacy policy. Optional information may also be combined with information from other users or third-parties. Other users may rate or comment about your optional information, and/or your information may be combined with Civil Beat content. If this isn’t agreeable to you, then please do not provide this optional information to us. We can’t control what the entire world does with this optional information and are not responsible for whatever happens to this optional information.
