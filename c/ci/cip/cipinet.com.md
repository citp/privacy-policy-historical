For search engine listing, we ask for the information such as URL and Email Address. IP address is also saved at the time of website submission. Email address is neither used to send newsletter(s) nor shared with or sold to anyone for any reason. It is required to contact the webmaster if need arises. We store email addresses for two months and then records are deleted. Cipinet automatically receives and records information when a visitor uses our search engine. The information includes Keywords used, IP address, the type of Browser used and the time the search was made. This information is used only for the purpose of improving our search engine services.

Email address is only used for sending email when their website is either approved or disapproved. Website submission in web directory is free. Sponsoring links feature is optional if any member wants to sponsor their link only on web directory. Their link will be ranked higher in that category and web directory search pages. If sponsored link is not found suitable, it will be rejected and amount paid will be refunded. No money is refunded if the website is approved. Sponsoring a link in directory does not mean their website will be included or ranked higher in Cipinet search engine. We want to make it clear that no website is rejected because it should have been sponsored. Website is only rejected if an editor does not find it suitable for inclusion. Holiday offer is valid from the day it appears on directory pages and is valid till the date mentioned.
