# Privacy Policy | CIPD

You have the right to:

 **Request access** to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. Note, however, that we may be unable to supply certain pieces of information that you have requested, if it is subject to legal privilege or relates to management planning. This will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

You can submit a subject access request to the CIPD by emailing [dataprotection@cipd.co.uk](mailto:dataprotection@cipd.co.uk "dataprotection@cipd.co.uk"), or by calling the customer services team on **+44 (0)208 612 6208**.

To assist us in processing your request, you will need to provide the following information:

  * Full name
  * Membership number (If applicable)
  * Telephone number
  * Email address
  * Information sought (Please describe, in as much detail as possible, the information you wish to have access to and if appropriate, any dates relevant to the information sought.)



 **Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

You can update your personal data by making amendments in the ‘My Profile’ section of our website, by emailing us at [dataprotection@cipd.co.uk](mailto:dataprotection@cipd.co.uk "dataprotection@cipd.co.uk"), or by calling **+44 (0)208 612 6208**.

 **Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request or as soon as possible thereafter. We may also anonymise rather than delete your data.

You can submit a request, by emailing [dataprotection@cipd.co.uk](mailto:dataprotection@cipd.co.uk "dataprotection@cipd.co.uk"), alternatively by calling on **+44 (0)208 612 6208**.

You will be asked for the following information to assist us in processing your request:

  * Full name
  * Membership number (if applicable)
  * Telephone number
  * Email address of your CIPD web account (if applicable)



If you would like to exercise any of the rights below, you can email, call or write to us, on the contact details provided below. Please provide your full name, membership number (if applicable), contact telephone number and email address.

 **Object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

 **Request restriction of processing** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

 **Request the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

 **Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

If you would like to opt out from receiving marketing messages from us, please see section above on OPTING OUT.

### WHAT WE WILL NEED FROM YOU

We will need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

### TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

### THIRD-PARTY LINKS

Our websites may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.
