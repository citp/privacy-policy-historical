IMPORTANT NOTICE–PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. THIS PRIVACY POLICY DESCRIBES THE POLICIES OF SONY MEDIA CLOUD SERVICES LLC (“SONY MCS,” “WE,” “US,” OR “OUR”) FOR THE COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OUR WEBSITE AND SERVICES. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO REVIEW THE ENTIRE PRIVACY POLICY.

Sony MCS values your privacy and believes you have a right to know what type of information we may collect when you interact with us and/or use our products, and our practices with respect to that information. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) governs your access to our websites www.sonymcs.com, www.cithebigpicture.com, [www.cimediacloud.com](http://www.cimediacloud.com/), and workspace.cimediacloud.com as well as our services, products and related software and toolset, all of which are presently marketed under the trademark Ci (pronounced “see”) (collectively, “Ci”). This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect through your use of Ci and the manner in which it may be used by Sony MCS, our agents, subsidiaries, trusted partners and affiliates acting on our behalf.

By using Ci you expressly consent to the information practices described in this Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy is intended to assist you in making informed decisions when using our website and services. Please take your time to read and understand the policy.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, all information and data submitted through any third party website or application will also be subject to such third party’s privacy policy and not ours.

To help protect you and others, we monitor use of our website, and use the information we collect, including personally identifiable information, to identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and investigate and/or seek prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse of our website; ensure compliance with the applicable terms of service and this Privacy Policy; investigate violations of or enforce these agreements; and otherwise to protect the rights and property of Sony MCS, its partners, and customers. Monitoring may result in the collection, recording, and analysis of online activity or communications through our website. If you do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your use of Ci.

**1\. Information We Collect.**

**Information You Provide.** When you register for an account we may collect some personal information such as your name, email address, password, company, address, and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information)(“Personal Information”). We may also collect information in connection with your use of our sharing and collaboration features such as the email addresses for your contacts that you wish to share content with and/or invite to join Ci. From time to time we may also request additional demographic information which you may provide at your discretion. ****

**Your Content. __** We collect and store files you upload, download or access with Ci, along with any metadata associated with that content or any metadata created in association with your use of Ci (e.g., user-entered tags and classifications, user comments).

**Log Data.** When you use Ci, we automatically record information from your device, its software, and your activity using Ci. This may include your IP address, browser type, access times, referring website addresses or other information included in HTTP headers. We may also collect information about your account activity and files and pages accessed by you. Such information is sometimes referred to as web analytics and/or clickstream data.

**Cookies/Web Beacons.** We use certain types of technologies such as cookies and web beacons to keep track of your visits, preferences and profile information. Among other things, we use this information to make Ci easier to use and to provide you with a more personal and convenient experience.

A “cookie” is a small file which is downloaded through your browser when you visit a website and stored on your device’s hard drive. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your login email and password for future logins to Ci. We may also use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of Ci, to better understand how you use Ci, and to aggregate usage and web traffic routing on Ci. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default settings. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies however, you may not be able to use or access all aspects of Ci.

We and some of our third party partners use Flash cookies to store some of your preferences or personal information. For more information on Flash cookies and how to manage privacy and storage settings [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html). In some of our email messages, we use “click-through URLs” or pixel tags to determine whether the email has been opened and to measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.

**2\. How We Use Your Information.  **In general we use your personal information to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information or services you request, to facilitate your use of Ci, to inform you about products, services or promotions we think may be of interest to you, and to otherwise serve you. In particular, we may use your personal information to:

  * Enable any premium services you have purchased, process transactions and send you billing invoices;
  * Respond to your customer service requests, questions and concerns;
  * Provide you with service notices and product announcements;
  * Send you requested updates and newsletters about Ci or other services;
  * Send you marketing, informational, product development and promotional communications;
  * Request feedback and enable us to develop, customize and improve Ci;
  * Conduct research and analysis about Ci;
  * Enable you to communicate, collaborate and share your content with other Ci users you designate;

**3\. Information Sharing.  **We will not give, sell, rent, share or trade any of your personal information or content that you store in Ci with any third party except as outlined in this Privacy Policy, or with your consent. To the extent we share your information with third party companies, these companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services. For clarity, we do not currently share information with other third parties for their use in marketing activities.

We may also share your personal information:

  * With Sony MCS affiliates and representatives;
  * As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process;

**Service Providers, Business Partners and Others. __** We may use certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help us with our business activities (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of Ci’s features). These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy. As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Amazon’s S3 s storage service to store some of your information (for example, your content). You can find more information on Amazon’s data security from the [S3 site](http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1697).

**Aggregate Data.** Aggregate data is information we collect about a group or category of services or users for which individual user identities have been removed. No personal information is included in aggregate data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our user’s needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise modify or improve our services. This Privacy Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection or use of aggregate data, and we may share aggregate data about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customer needs and improve our services and for advertising and marketing purposes.

**4\. Network and Information Security.  **We seek to maintain reasonable security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized or accidental disclosure, access, misuse, loss, or alteration. Although we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information. There is no such thing as perfect security. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any passively-collected personal information you choose to include in the files you store in Ci are maintained at adequate levels of protection to meet specific needs or obligations you may have relating to that information.

**7.  Use of Analytics Tools. **We may use analytics tools and other third party technologies such as Google Analytics and DoubleClick Cookies to collect non-personal information in the form of various usage and user metrics when you use Ci or visit our websites.
