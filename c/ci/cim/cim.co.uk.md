# Privacy Policy | CIM

We will only share your data with third parties for the purposes of delivering our services, fulfilling any contracts we enter with you, where required by law or to enforce our legal rights.

### Third party communications

CIM will not disclose your details to third parties for the purpose of receiving communications from those third parties, including relevant business information, unless you specifically opt-in to this type of communication.

### Service providers

Only when necessary to deliver our services and run our business, we share your information with various providers who will act as data processors. These include:

  * Telephone and email providers
  * Payment processing providers
  * IT service providers
  * Hosting providers
  * Mailing houses and print/fulfilment companies
  * Member benefit providers



### Mailing, print and fulfilment companies

CIM will only disclose your information to print and fulfilment companies who are conducting business on CIM's behalf and only for an agreed purpose, such as magazine distribution, operational membership mailings or marketing mailings. Data is securely encrypted and, once the purpose for which it was transferred is complete, it is deleted.

### Payment information

CIM does not store credit/debit card details, except for the purposes of processing bookings for Moor Hall Conference Centre guests, when these details are stored securely and destroyed following payment. CIM does not share financial details with any third parties. However, it may (in appropriate circumstances) use certain other companies to provide services to you, such as a credit card processing company or a Direct Debit service. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personal information for any purposes other than to provide this service to CIM.

### Research

CIM may share your details with third parties for the purposes of conducting research on our behalf, including membership surveys, only when you have consented to your data being processed in this way. You may change your preferences at any time via our website.

### Qualification assessment details

Studying members’ examination grades will be shared with their CIM Accredited Study Centre (the educational institution which delivered the CIM qualification) and with the Department for Education. This data may also be shared with our Regulators: OfQual, CEA, Qualification Wales in the event of any investigations.

### Verification requests

CIM may sometimes receive verification requests of qualification or membership status from current or prospective employers, employment agencies, regulators or other third party contacts. CIM will only confirm your qualification or membership status if a consent form, signed by you, accompanies the request.

### Chartered Marketers and CPD

CIM provides a service for members to record their CPD online through a third party processor, including data recording via an online app. CIM will use the information recorded for management of CPD and Chartered Marketer status and as part of its wider monitoring of members’ progress.

We have a policy of transparency regarding the names of our Chartered Marketers and as such, we publish each individual’s name and CIM Region on our website. Members may request that their name be removed by contacting our Customer Services team.

### Disciplinary

If a Member of any grade is subject to a disciplinary case in which the complaint is upheld, CIM will publish their name and the outcome of the disciplinary case. Any such processing will be completed on the basis of our own legitimate interests.

### Sharing your information for legal reasons

CIM will share your information when required to do so in order to comply with a common law or statutory obligation. For example, this may include information surrounding criminal acts or threats to public security.

### Transfer of your information outside the European Economic Area (EEA)

If you are a member of a non-EEA CIM Region or registered with a study centre outside of the EEA, information that CIM collects may be transferred to that Region or study centre, which may not have data protection laws in force equivalent to those within the EEA. CIM will nevertheless take steps to ensure that personal data transferred is adequately protected. Any data transferred in this way will be securely encrypted and, once it has been used for the purpose it was transferred, it will be deleted.

Outside of the circumstances described above, we will not transfer your personal data to any country outside the EEA.
