### Cookies

When you visit our web site, your browser automatically sends us certain Internet-related information (such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you’re using). We also may use cookies to better understand how visitors use our site.

Cookies are small text files that web sites often store on the computer hard drives of visitors to their sites. A cookie contains a unique code, which is used to recognize your computer when a user of your computer returns to a web site that was visited previously. Web beacons are Internet tools that help us determine, for example, whether a web site page has been viewed. We use cookies and Web beacons to enhance the online experience of our visitors and to better understand how our site is used. Cookies and Web beacons may tell us, for example, whether you have visited our site before or whether you are a new visitor.

The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Remember, though, without cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our web site features.

### Information We Share

Cichic does not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal information about our web site visitors, except as described as follows: (i) if we are required to do so by law, (ii) in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided through this web site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.

### Links to Other Sites

Occasionally we provide links to other web sites for your convenience and information. These sites operate independently from our site and are not under our control. These sites may have their own privacy notices in place, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked web sites. We are not responsible for the content of these sites, any products or services that may be offered through these sites, or any other use of these sites.

### Security

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized disclosure, use, alteration or destruction of the personal information in our possession. When you provide credit card information to make a purchase, we use the industry standard for Internet security -- Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology -- to help protect the information you provide. This Internet encryption standard scrambles data as it travels from your computer to our server. Please note, however, that perfect security does not exist on the Internet. You’ll know that you’re in a secure area of our web site when a "lock" icon appears on your screen and the "http" portion of our URL address changes to "https." The "s" stands for "secure."
