##  Privacy Statement

**Introduction**  
CIC recognizes the importance of protecting personally identifiable information that you share with us and has established its privacy policies to demonstrate our commitment to keep your personal information confidential and secure. The personally identifiable information we may collect from you will include, by way of example:

  * Domain name and IP address;
  * E-mail address;
  * Contact information (including, name, address, zip code, country, and phone number);
  * Age;
  * Gender;
  * Your location;
  * Financial information, such as account or credit card numbers;
  * User-specific and aggregate information on areas of the website that you access;
  * Username and password information for the use of CIC services; and
  * Other information volunteered by you, such as information provided through responses, registrations, reviews, comments, emails, postings, digital postcards, messages or other electronic submissions and communications sent by you to CIC or our website.



You should not provide CIC with any personally identifiable information (or submit any personally identifiable information to CIC's website) unless you would like that information to be used by CIC in accordance with this policy. This policy addresses activities only from our servers maintained in the United States. Third party web sites (including linked sites and third-party web sites or services which are co-branded with CIC) may have their own policies, over which we exercise no control over, and therefore they are not addressed by this policy and we do not warrant or opine as to the reliability or adequacy thereof. We are not responsible for any information you provide to third party vendors or customers directly, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them. 

**Personally Identifiable Information CIC collects on its web site**  
You may provide certain personally identifiable information to us in a number of ways such as when you: (a) request support; (b) request information; (c) request access to certain resources on our web site; (d) request access to our download site; (e) sign up for special offers from us or our partners, or (f) enter sweepstakes and contests sponsored by us or one of our partners. CIC may also collect personally identifiable information from you at other points that specifically state that personally identifiable information is being collected. 

**Use of Personally Identifiable Information by CIC**  
CIC may use personally identifiable information for, among other things, to anticipate and resolve problems with and to improve our web site, to personalize our service to you, to investigate misuse of our web site, and to develop and market products and services that may be of interest to you. We do not sell, rent or share personally identifiable information with third parties without your prior consent except in the limited circumstances described in this policy. We may share personally identifiable information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing internal functions necessary to operate our business. These functions may include: analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and processing payment transactions. In all cases we limit the information shared with our third-party vendors to that which is necessary to carry out those functions. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with this policy, we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information, and we require these parties to use any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

**Passively Tracked Data**  
When you visit the site, we also passively track information on your computer and Internet connection, such as the IP address of your computer and/or Internet service provider, the date and time you access the site, the Internet address of websites from which you link to our site, the computer technology you are using and your movements and preferences on our site. We collect passively tracked data primarily for purposes of administering, protecting and improving our site and our systems, to better understand the preferences of our site visitors, to identify server problems, to compile aggregated statistics about site usage, and to help personalize your experience on our site. We use technology that many other websites employ, including, without limitation, “cookies” or small data files stored on your computer's hard drive, to collect such information. In some instances, we also use cookies to collect information in connection with future visits from that website, to recognize you as a previous visitor, or to track your activity on our site. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. If you follow a link to the site from an affiliate or promotion, we store information about your arrival from that affiliate or promotion in a session cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit our site. You can refuse cookies by turning them off on your browser. But, if you want to access webpages that require registration, you need to accept a mandatory session cookie, which you can delete after you leave the site.

**Receiving emails from CIC**  
If you do not wish to receive email messages from us about our products and services that may interest you please refer to our “contact us” page to phone, fax or email CIC to be removed from our email list. Any of your personally identifiable information disclosed by us to third parties (we disclose such only with your permission) is subject to such third parties’ privacy policies and we cannot control such parties use of that information or the manner or frequency of such parities’ contact with you.

**Ability to Prevent Third-Party Access to Your Personally Identifiable Information**  
CIC cannot guarantee that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, but not by way of limitation, CIC may be compelled to disclose information by government regulation or subpoena. Additionally, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your personally identifiable information to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials, as we, in our sole and reasonable discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. Therefore, it is possible that under certain circumstances your personally identifiable information or private communications may not remain private.

**Security Measures**  
We use reasonable security measures in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. However, we cannot guarantee protection of all information in all cases. For example, we cannot guarantee protection against interception, misappropriation, misuse, or alteration, or that your information will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Additionally, we have absolutely no control over the security of other sites you might visit, interact with or do business with. If we learn of a security systems breach, then we will attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. CIC may post a notice on its website if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us.

The CIC website is hosted in the United States. If you are a user accessing the CIC website (or providing information that is hosted on or routed through the CIC website) from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States which does not have the same data protection laws as the European Union and other regions, and by providing your personal data you permit:

  * The use of your personal data for the uses identified above in accordance with this privacy policy; and
