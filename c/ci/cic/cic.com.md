### _Information Shared Outside of iSIGN_

Except as explained in this Privacy Notice, in privacy policies for specific services, or in agreements with our clients and customers, iSIGN does not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers or people using our Services, or website visitors with others without the consent of the person whose information will be shared.

iSIGN uses vendors and partners for a variety of business purposes such as to help us offer, provide, repair and bill for Services we provide.  We share information with those vendors and partners when it is necessary for them to perform work on our behalf.  For example, we may provide your credit card information and billing address to our payment processing company solely for the purpose of processing payment for a transaction you have requested.  We ask that these vendors and partners protect the customer information we provide to them and use iSIGN customer data only for the purposes for which it was provided.  We request that these types of vendors and partners refrain from using this information for their own marketing purposes.

As described in more detail in other sections of this Privacy Notice, iSIGN also may share certain information with outside companies.  However, except as provided in this Policy Notice, such information does not contain any personally identifiable information.  We may disclose personally identifiable information in the following circumstances:

  * to comply with valid legal process including subpoenas, court orders or search warrants, and as otherwise authorized by law;
  * in cases involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person or other emergencies;
  * to protect our rights or property, or the safety of our customers or employees;
  * to protect against fraudulent, malicious, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of or subscription to our services and to protect our network, services, devices and users from such use;
  * to advance or defend against complaints or legal claims in court, administrative proceedings and elsewhere;
  * to credit bureaus or collection agencies for reporting purposes or to obtain payment for iSIGN-billed services;
  * to a third-party that you have authorized to verify your account information;
  * to outside auditors and regulators; or
  * with your consent.



When you purchase services offered jointly by iSIGN and one of our partners, customer information may be received by both iSIGN and our partner that is providing your service.  For these jointly offered services, you should also review the partner company's privacy policy, which may include practices that are different from the practices described here.  If iSIGN enters into a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets or business, customer information will also be transferred as part of or in connection with the transaction.

### _Security_

Subject to the following paragraphs, iSIGN takes all reasonably diligent precautions to protect personally identifiable information, both online and off-line.  We protect personally identifiable information using technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls.  If you believe your account has been abused, please contact us following the instructions in the Contact Us section below. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error-free and, as set forth in the Terms of Service, iSIGN makes no warranty and assumes no liability for any such transmission or any damages incurred in connection therewith.  If you have any questions about our Website security, please contact [legal@cic.com](mailto:legal@cic.com).
