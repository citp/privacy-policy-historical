# CIC : Policies > Privacy Statement

**Introduction**  
CIC recognizes the importance of protecting personally identifiable information that you share with us and has established its privacy policies to demonstrate our commitment to keep your personal information confidential and secure.  Personally identifiable information includes your name, address, and e-mail address.

This policy addresses activities only from our servers.  Third party Web sites (including linked sites and third-party web sites or services which are co-branded with CIC) may have their own policies, over which we exercise no control over, and therefore they are not addressed by this policy and we do not warrant or opine as to the reliability or adequacy thereof.

**Personally Identifiable** **Information CIC collects on its web site  
**You may provide certain personally identifiable information to us in a number of ways such as when you: (a) request support; (b) request information; (c) request access to certain resources on our web site; (d) request access to our download site; (e) sign up for special offers from us or our partners, or (f) enter sweepstakes and contests sponsored by us or one of our partners. CIC may also collect personally identifiable information from you at other points that specifically state that personally identifiable information is being collected. 

**Use of Personally Identifiable Information by CIC  
**CIC may use personally identifiable information for, among other things, to anticipate and resolve problems with and to improve our web site, to personalize our service to you, to investigate misuse of our web site, and to develop and market products and services that may be of interest to you.  We do not sell or otherwise provide your Personally Identifiable Information to any third parties without your express permission. 

**Receiving emails from CIC  
**If you do not wish to receive e-mail messages from us about our products and services that may interest you please refer to our “contact us” page to phone, fax or email CIC to be removed from our email list. Any of your personally identifiable information disclosed by us to third parties (we disclose such only with your permission) is subject to such third parties’ privacy policies and we cannot control such parties use of that information or the manner or frequency of such parities’ contact with you.

**Ability to prevent third-party access to your personally identifiable information  
**CIC cannot guarantee that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, but not by way of limitation, CIC may be compelled to disclose information by government regulation or subpoena.  Additionally third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your personally identifiable information to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials, as we, in our sole and reasonable discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. Therefore, it is possible that under certain circumstances your personally identifiable information or private communications may not remain private.

Cookies are data files, sent by our web site, that are stored on your computer.  They contain identification information that allows us to see how our users are interacting with our web site, if we have repeat visitors and to identify which sites our visitors are linking from.  This information is valuable to us for site development and general marketing purposes. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information.

**Security measures  
**CIC uses industry-standard methods to safeguard the confidentiality of personally identifiable information, such as firewalls and secure socket layers where appropriate. However, absolute security does not exist on the Internet.
