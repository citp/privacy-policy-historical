## How we use the information we collect

#### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics and other similar services to track website visitor activity at both the aggregate and individual level. We’ve enabled user ID tracking in Google Analytics, which allows Google to track your web activity and online behavior. However, the user ID is still anonymous to us. Google uses this information to personalize advertisements to you for goods and services.

You can opt out of having your information used by Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. To access and use the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, [click here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). 

We also use Adobe Analytics and Test & Target to analyze and optimize the performance of our websites. To learn about Adobe’s privacy policies or to opt out of Adobe Analytics tracking, [click here](http://www.adobe.com/privacy.html). 

#### Third Parties

We engage third parties to perform services such as payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, product customization, order fulfillment and shipping, marketing and promotional material distribution, web site evaluation, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing. We provide your personal information to these third parties, but we authorize them to use this information only in connection with the services they perform. 

To opt-out of receiving online display advertisements tailored to your interests by our third party partners, visit the Network Advertising Initiative at [www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices). You can also set a Do Not Track preference in your browser.

## Links to other sites

This website may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. 

## Security

We have implemented systems and procedures to secure the information we collect online. For example, we protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you input. This industry standard encrypts all of your information, including credit card numbers, so that it cannot be read by others as the information is exchanged via the Internet. 

Additionally, it is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. If you use a shared computer, be sure to sign off and close all browsers when you are finished. 

We do not sell our products to anyone under the age of 21. We use a non-affiliated third party company, Veratad Technologies, LLC, to verify that you are who you say you are and to confirm that you are 21 or older. 

### How does Veratad’s Age Verification work?

[](http://www.veratad.com/) Veratad’s AgeMatch Age Verification services use multiple trusted data sources containing billions of public records to return an age validation based on the personal information you submit. This service is specifically designed to validate and protect your identity while maintaining the highest level of consumer privacy when processing online transactions. 

Access to the public records allows Veratad to validate the information you provide and in some cases, depending on the nature of your purchase, to present a series of multiple choice questions based on non-credit related (“out-of-wallet”) historical facts about you. These facts are obtained by instantaneously scanning billions of public records from trusted data sources containing information that would not generally be found in your wallet if lost or stolen. 

### Is the information I provide secure?

Veratad’s secure 256 bit encryption technology ensures the safe delivery of the information you provide online. In addition, Veratad **does not** store your sensitive personal information or share (or sell) any data with other third parties. This practice assures you that unauthorized parties cannot gain access to your sensitive personal information. 

### What happens if I cannot be verified by the Age Verification process?

A small percentage of shoppers may not be verifiable due to limited availability of publicly available information in the age verification databases. If this happens, we will attempt to contact you via phone and email to verify your age. We typically require a copy of your driver’s license or some other form of government issued ID that verifies your date of birth. 

### I live outside of the U.S. Can I be verified?

Our use of Veratad’s Age Verification is based solely on U.S. records and therefore verification of individuals residing outside the U.S. is unavailable, unless you are using a military address outside the U.S. Individuals in all other countries will be subject to our manual review process described in the previous section. 

## Updates

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will update this page and the effective date listed below.
