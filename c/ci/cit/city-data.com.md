# Privacy Policy

The following Privacy Policy summarizes the various ways that Advameg, Inc. (“Service Provider,” “we” or “our”) collects and uses the personally identifiable information garnered through our website, www.city-data.com (“Website”). It is our goal to bring you information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, protect your privacy.

## **THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THE WEBSITE COLLECTS**

Personally identifiable information is collected by the Website with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, register for our forum or business profile, you maybe be asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name, or phone number. Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested. By submitting such web form contained on this Website, you agree to the processing and storage of your information by the Service Provider.

If you contact us by email through the Website, we reserve the right to also keep a record of the email itself and any personally identifiable information provided in that email and any others that result, in order to respond to them and for any other purpose described in this Policy.

Our servers may also automatically collect information about your computer when you visit the Website, including without limitation the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running, date and time of the visit, the website that referred you, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. Your IP address is usually associated with your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university, and may identify your physical location.

## **DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We generally do not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties. However, we reserve the right to disclose this information if we reasonably believe it is needed for any of the following reasons:  
1\. Pursuant to a subpoena or other governmental request  
2\. For any other reason required by law  
3\. In order to protect our employees, independent contractors, affiliates, the users of this Website or the public at large and their property, rights and safety  
4\. To enforce any terms of service on this Website  
5\. To provide you with the services or products requested by you

Your personally identifiable information may also be disclosed, without limitation, if the Service Provider is acquired or in the event of any sale or transfer of assets of the Service Provider.

We use the personally identifiable information that we receive to contact you about your requests to us. We may also, from time to time, send you information that we feel that you might be interested in. 

We will use your information only as permitted by law. Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. As one example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive. Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners, but cannot be used to contact you individually.

## **HOW THE WEBSITE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU**

We may use personally identifying information you supply through the Website to provide you with the service you have requested. For example, if you subscribe to our forum, we may use your e-mail address to send you periodic e-mails. Similarly, if you enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. If you do not wish to receive future commercial communications from us by e-mail, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the e-mail.

We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or forums and job search software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services. We reserve the right to use the information we collect about your computer, which may at times contain sufficient information for us to be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose, including without limitation to help diagnose problems with our servers, to gather broad demographic information, and to otherwise administer our Website. 

We reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners. 

As our business changes, we may buy or sell various assets. In the event all or a portion of the assets owned or controlled by the Service Provider, its parent or any subsidiary or affiliated entity are sold, assigned, transferred or acquired by another company, the information from and/or about our Website users may be among the transferred assets. 

## **AFFILIATED SITES, LINKED SITES AND ADVERTISEMENTS**

We expect our partners, advertisers and third-party affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. However, third parties, including our business partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our Website, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visits to our Website you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a Website page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party.

We are not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties.

While on our Website, our advertisers, business partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising may be served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Through features available on our Website, third parties may use cookies or other technology to gather information.

The exclusive jurisdiction for any claim, dispute, or litigation (“Litigation”) arising out of the operation of the Website or this policy shall be vested in the federal and state courts located in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, and such courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of any such Litigation.
