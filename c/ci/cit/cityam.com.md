Whenever disclosing personal information through our forms there will be further details of why we are collecting the information asked for.

We want to make sure it is as easy for you to opt out of our services as it is to opt in.

Our service is aimed at adults over the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect data from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13 we request you do not give us information about yourself.

## **Cookie Policy**

**1.What, Why and How**

A cookie and similar tracking technologies such as tags, scripts and beacons are small files (hereafter referred to as cookies) downloaded on to your device when you access most websites and allows sites to recognise the device if it makes a return visit.

There are different types of cookies used for different purposes. There are cookies where we give you the option to opt in/ opt out but there are some that are essential. As laid out in the Terms and Condition statement, we cannot control other websites.

A cookie might be stored on your browser:

  * To make sure the website can function properly
  * To enable you to make use of the secure online services we provide
  * To collect anonymous information where available about the users journey, IP address, device IDs and preferences which helps us improve our online offering and marketing
  * To make advertising and promotional offers more effective.
  * To remember your preferences and make the site easier for you to access



Information collected by cookies will remain anonymous – if the collected data is ever merged with any other, personally identifiable information, which you have provided us (such as email address) the cookies are anonymised.

Some cookies are retained in your browser for the period you are on our website, some persist for longer specified/ unspecified periods.

**2\. Types of cookies**

  * Pre-session cookies: these are cookies that help maintain security and store information while you are using our site. They are only stored while you are using our website and they are deleted when you leave the site.
  * Persistent cookies: these cookies have an expiration date and will stay on your device until they are deleted or expire.
  * First/ Third Party Cookies: The difference between a first or third party cookie will depend on the domain/ website placing the cookie. A first party cookie is a cookie that has been placed on the user’s device by a domain the user has visited. A third party cookie is placed by a domain other than the one the user has visited. For example if you visit our site and another company drops a pixel, this would be considered a third party pixel.



**3\. Consent**

We use a Consent Management Platform for you to opt-in to cookie collection and give you full control over opt-in/opt-out. Please note our website may not function correctly if you change certain preferences, such as disabling all cookies. Opting out of cookies will not disable advertising – we depend on advertising revenue to keep our content free of charge. You can amend your preferences on the Privacy Settings box on your window. You cannot access our site unless you have given or rejected (on a purpose/ cookie based level) consent. We also use the below partners, please see their privacy policies for opt-out options:

**Cookie**|  **Type**|  **Description**  
---|---|---  
Google Analytics,  
DoubleClick  
Google AdSense| Site analytics and advertising| Google (www.google.com) operates the Google Display Network a collection of millions of websites and mobile applications that are powered by display advertising, including many Google services like YouTube. Google also operates the DoubleClick digital advertising platform: the ad technology foundation to create, transact, and manage digital advertising for the worlds buyers, creators, and sellers. The DoubleClick platform includes the DoubleClick Advertising Exchange and DoubleClick Bid Manager. To learn more about how we collect and use information for online advertising, please visit <http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy.html>  
Chartbeat| Analytics| A sustainable web demands we measure and monetize attention. Since the web’s creation, the standard unit of success has been the click. Yet the goal of content creation has always been to get the right information to the right people and have them consume it, understand it, learn from it. This massive disconnect of goals and metrics has led to a web that rewards empty traffic, clickbait headlines, and billions of unseen ad impressions. Chartbeat is changing that. We quantify the value between the clicks. We partner with editorial teams to identify their highest quality content — the pieces that pique and keep reader attention. We partner with advertising teams to plan campaigns around this high-quality content so these ads are seen more often and for longer. This shift to valuing and transacting on the time people are paying attention means publishers creating quality content get paid more for it, brands get the time in front of an attentive audience they’re paying for, and readers get the best user experience possible. <http://chartbeat.com/privacy/>  
Facebook Connect| Social media| Facebook Developers is a social media platform that allows Facebook users to create Social Plugins, Graph APIs, and Social Channels, that enables websites to provide engaging social experiences to their users: <https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/>  
Sonobi| Advertising| We bring web publishers and advertisers together via a single buying and selling solution tuned to enable publishers to maximize ad revenue and advertisers to buy quality impressions<http://sonobi.com/privacy-policy/>  
Idio| Idio’s Demand Orchestration platform learns from each buyer interaction to improve omni-channel engagement and accelerate demand at large B2B enterprises. Global leaders including Intel, Fitch Ratings, and AllianceBernstein use Idio’s AI & 1st party intent data to automate marketing complexity and engage every buyer individually.<https://idio.ai/website-privacy-and-cookies-policy/>  
Adobe Analytics| Analytics| Adobe Analytics is the industry-leading solution for applying real-time analytics and detailed segmentation across all of your marketing channels. Use it to discover high-value audiences and power customer intelligence for your business.<http://www.adobe.com/gr_en/privacy/marketing-cloud.html>  
Alexa Metrics| Analytics| Alexa Internet grew out of a vision of intelligent Web navigation constantly improving through its users. Since then, our Alexa users have downloaded millions of Toolbars, and Alexa has created one of the largest Web crawls, and developed the infrastructure to process and serve massive amounts of data.<http://www.alexa.com/help/privacy>  
  
Please note that some of our business partners (e.g. advertisers) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. Additionally, emails we send may contain a bit of code known as a “web beacon”. This code allows us to understand the time and date of when a user has opened an email and when he/she has utilised a link within the email to visit a website. Our web beacons do not collect personally identifiable information. Users wishing to disable our web beacons should do so by turning images “off” in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email client for more information.
