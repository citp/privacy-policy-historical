      Times-Shamrock websites, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information.  This privacy statement (the "Statement") discloses the privacy practices for
      Times-Shamrock websites (the "Website") - what information we gather, how we use it and how to correct or change it.  This Statement only addresses our activities from our servers.  Other sites (including those to which the Website links and third party sites provide services with which
      Times-Shamrock websites) may have their own privacy policies and practices, which we do not control.  Questions regarding this Statement should be e-mailed to

      <br>
      Times-Shamrock's network of sites contain links to partners, advertisers and third party Internet sites and services who may collect data in connection with sweepstakes, promotions, e-commerce,
      etc.  They each have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily and publicly disclose personal information on any online service or Web site- for example on message boards, through E-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others.  In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public,  you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.  Further, while we strive to protect your personal information,
      Times-Shamrock websites cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

      <b>Use of Information</b><br>
      <br>
      All of the information Times-Shamrock websites collects, both what you tell us and what we collect through the  use of cookies, is "aggregated" - meaning that the information from many users is grouped together in a way that does not disclose the personal information of any particular user.  We may use this aggregated information to evaluate which products and services are successful and which are not, and in order to evaluate which new services we should make available on our Web site.  We may use only the anonymous click stream data to help our advertisers deliver better-targeted advertisements.
      Times-Shamrock websites will not disclose any information about any individual without the individual's consent, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process.  There may be some cases in which some of your personal information may be used by

      <b>Registration</b><br>
      <br>
      Anyone who participates in interactive activities (chat, message boards or
      opinion posting, contests, store and product purchase, membership program) on
      Times-Shamrock's network of Web sites may be asked to  register for a free guest ID and password or to complete subscription registration for a member ID and password.  We use customer contact information from this registration form to send the user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners.  Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services.  The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary for customer service reasons.  Users may opt out of receiving future mailings; please reference your Personal Options.  Unique identifiers such as ID and passwords, are collected to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Children Under the Age of 13</b><br>
      <br>
      We do not currently collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen.  Under certain circumstances, visitors may be asked to submit a screen name as a means of identifying communications to
      Times-Shamrock websites<br>
      Children of any age should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
      If in the future, if Times-Shamrock websites collects personally identifiable information from children, it will do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cookies</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them.  A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited.  But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself.  Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site.  A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.  This random number lets us keep track of "how many" times customers are doing specific things- like visiting our site each month - without really knowing who those customers are.  We also use  cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly.  We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your member ID.  Additionally, after you've entered your member ID and password during a session on our service, we save that information so you don't have to reenter it repeatedly during that session.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">User should be aware that Times-Shamrock websites
      cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting     information by advertisers or third parties hosting data for
      Times-Shamrock websites.  If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note that cookies may be  necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information available on the
      Times-Shamrock network of web sites).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Surveys</b><br>
      <br>
      Our online surveys ask visitors for their E-mail address and demographic information.  Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site.  We use this data to tailor our visitors experience at our site, showing them content and promotional offers that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.  This information is shared  with advertisers only on an aggregate basis.  We may use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company and promotional material from
      Times-Shamrock websites or some of our partners.  Users may opt out of receiving future mailings in Personal Options.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Contests</b><br>
      <br>
      We run contests on our sites in which we ask visitors for Times-Shamrock websites
      ID and password.       We use contact data from our contests to send users information about upcoming contests and promotional offers.  On occasion we will E-mail customers promotional material from some of our partners.  The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary for winner notification and prize delivery confirmation.  The majority of the contests that we offer are hosted on
      Times-Shamrock sites; however, there may be cases in which a third party sponsor will host the contest and collect user information.  In those cases, we urge users to review the privacy statement of the third party site.  Users may opt out of receiving future mailings in Personal Options.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Changes</b><br>
      <br>
      Times-Shamrock websites reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy without notice.  In the event of a change of this policy, procedures will be developed for users to opt-out or otherwise prohibit any future use of their individually identifiable information that is not currently covered under this policy.</font></p>
