Please remember that we will continue to protect personal information about you regardless of your privacy choices.</p><p>If you are a customer of another Citigroup affiliate, you should also review that privacy notice since you may need to separately notify that affiliate of your 							privacy choices.</p><h2>Limit Disclosure to Nonaffiliated Third Parties (Box 1)</h2><p>As described in this notice, we will limit the personal information about you that we disclose to nonaffiliated third parties if you fill in Box 1 on the Privacy 						Choices Form or call Customer Service to make this election.</p><h2>Limit Sharing with Citigroup Affiliates (Box 2)</h2><p>Our ability to share information with our affiliates helps us to more easily provide you with quality products and services to meet your financial needs and 							goals.</p><p>The law allows us to share with our affiliates information about our transactions or experiences with you, such as your account history, and also your name, 							address, and telephone number.
