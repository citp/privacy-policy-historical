##  Security

When you place orders or access your account information, know that City Sports uses a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.

##  Ordering from www.citysports.com

  
We track customer traffic patterns and site usage, and collect the domain name of e-mail addresses of visitors to our site and aggregate (not personally identifiable) information on what pages visitors access. We use this information to monitor the use of the site and to improve its performance and usefulness. We also collect information you volunteer, such as survey responses, comments, purchasing and billing information, and your requests.

When you order from City Sports, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, billing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.

We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable.

We have established several relationships with third parties vendors to best serve our customers.
