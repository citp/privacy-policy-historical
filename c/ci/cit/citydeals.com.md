Although we strive to be as accurate as possible with shipping and delivery times they are only estimates and we are not liable for any shipping delays. 

We are not responsible for damaged product received through a third party carrier (UPS, FedEx, or USPS), which is out of our control. We are not responsible for shipments undeliverable as a result of incorrect address information supplied to us. We will attempt to contact the customer to resolve the error. 

Shipments that total more than $299.00 will be shipped via Express or Priority shipping methods and will require a signature upon delivery. 

Please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/index.php/contacts/index/) immediately if there is a shipping error due to a mistake we made. You can rest assured we will take care of it. In the event the wrong product is shipped to you, we will gladly replace it with the correct items when the incorrect products have been returned to us via a trackable method. Return postage for incorrect orders can be provided by contacting customer service.
