This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. The following measures are in place to protect customers from unauthorized use of their information. The online store uses SSL Encryption to scramble sensitive information (like bank account and credit card data) that is being sent back and forth from the CITM™ web server to the customer's web browser. Checks In The Mail is a secured facility and all phone calls, faxes, mail and e-mail are handled by authorized personnel. In addition, all computer systems are physically secured. 

  
**The Checks In The Mail** online store protects your transactions with the highest levels of security. 

Our servers use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced encryption technology that works with Netscape Navigator and Communicator (version 2.0 and above), Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 3.0 and above), and AOL (version 3.0 and above) browsers. SSL encrypts all of your personal information, including your account line specification, MICR line specification, or similar form of access number or access code for a credit card account, deposit account, transaction account or other nonpublic, private information , name, and address, so that it cannot be intercepted as the information travels over the Internet between your browser and our site.

While we use Secure Socket Layer encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our user's information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our Billing department or a Customer Service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.

Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

The VeriSign Secure Site service, is one of the most recognized symbols of trust on the Web, and offers our customers instant access to Checks In The Mail's security data. Verisign reports that it is virtually unheard of for someone's credit card info to be stolen via the Web and misused. And in the highly unlikely event that it is, the Fair Credit Billing Act protects e -shoppers against unauthorized use of credit information, limiting liability to only $50.
