**Privacy protection**

CityLink respects your right to privacy and is committed to privacy protection. This commitment is set out in our Privacy Code. The Privacy Code provides a set of policies that regulate the way that CityLink collects, uses and handles your personal information. The Code also provides background information about these issues. This page provides a brief summary about your privacy as a CityLink customer and the way that CityLink collects, uses and handles your personal information. If you are interested in these issues, you can read more in the Privacy Code.

**Your CityLink Account details**

We require the personal details that you provide on your CityLink Account application form to open and manage your CityLink Account and to process payments. If you do not provide us with these details, we will not be able to open your Account. If we have not opened your account and you drive on CityLink, you may be in breach of the Melbourne City Link Act and liable for a fine. The Melbourne City Link Act also requires that we collect your licence plate number, unless you open a special type of Anonymous Account.

**Travel on CityLink**

We use the information collected by the electronic toll collection system to calculate and collect your fees and to help us manage your CityLink Account.

As a vehicle travels through one of CityLink's toll zones, equipment on an overhead gantry will detect and classify the vehicle and will read the vehicle's e-TAG device. The computer system will automatically deduct the appropriate amount from the motorist's CityLink Account. The computer system will retain a record of the time and the date that the e-TAG device passed the overhead gantry.

To allow for motorists who use CityLink without paying, the overhead gantries include a video imaging system that takes overview images of vehicles and images of vehicles' number plates.

The images are only retained by the system and viewed by humans if a valid e-TAG device is not detected. Generally, this means that the images are only retained if a valid e-TAG device is not installed in a vehicle. The images may be retained in certain other limited circumstances, if for example the battery in an e-TAG device has run flat, or if a vehicle's CityLink registration has been suspended for non-payment.

We will destroy these images if we discover that a motorist had made arrangements to pay by purchasing a CityLink Pass, or if the e-TAG device battery had run flat. However, we may pass an image to Victoria Police if a motorist appears to have used CityLink without making arrangements to register their vehicle for use on CityLink.

As with many major roads in Australia, there are also a number of closed-circuit television cameras on CityLink. CityLink uses these cameras to monitor traffic conditions and incidents.

**Marketing information**

We may also use information that we collect from you for the communication of any of our other products and services. However, we recognise that you may not want your personal information to be used in this way. You have the right to inform us that you do not wish us to address our marketing communications specifically to you. We do not give your personal information to other organisations for their marketing purposes.

**Accessing or correcting your information**

If you wish to access your personal information, or you become aware that this information is incorrect, please contact us via email or phone 13 26 29.
