# CiteULike: Privacy Policy

This privacy policy explains how we use the information we collect about you, how you can tell us if you prefer to limit the use of that information, and the procedures that we have in place to safeguard your privacy.

## What information we store, and what we do with it

When you register, we collect and store your name and e-mail address. We will not share this information with anyone else for the purposes of marketing or spamming, nor will it appear on the web site without your permission.

When you use CiteULike to add information to your account after registration (for example, which academic articles you are reading) one of two things will happen: If you mark this information as "private" (where such an option exists on the web site's interface), we will keep this information private and not divulge it to anyone else. If you do not mark the information as private then you are using CiteULike as a publishing platform, and this information will be made publicly available on the site.

We may use aggregate statistics drawn from the information you provide for analysis, and we may pass this information on to others. If we do so, we will not include your username, real name, or email address in the data.

## Our use of cookies and other information gathering technologies

We use cookies to identify you when you revisit the site. We will not insult your intelligence by giving you our lawyer's explanation here, but if you are interested you can read the precise definition in the [original RFC](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt). 

## Updating your details

Facilities are provided on the site to enable you to update and change your details.

If you wish to change any other details not covered by these facilities then please let us know by sending an e-mail to citeulike at citeulike dot org.

## Your consent

By submitting your information, you consent to the use of that information as set out in this policy.

If we change our privacy policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the Web site. Continued use of the service will signify that you agree to any such changes.

## How to contact us

If you would like to contact us about our privacy policy, please send an e-mail to privacy at citeulike dot org.
