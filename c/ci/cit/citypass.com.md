# Privacy & Security | CityPASS®

CityPASS, Inc. ("CityPASS"), is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers and users of our Web site. We have therefore created this policy statement (the "Policy") to explain our privacy practices and procedures. 

We believe that you should know what information we collect from you, as well as understand how we use and protect that information. 

CityPASS will revise and update this Policy as we change practices within citypass.com. You should refer back to this page for the latest information. 

This Policy applies to CityPASS's Web site, which is intended for the use of persons residing throughout the world, and for order and delivery of CityPASS booklets and e-Tickets. 

By purchasing, subscribing to, or using CityPASS's Web site, you agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this Policy.

###  1\. Information We Collect 

CityPASS collects a variety of personally identifiable information about customers and visitors to our Web site in order to ensure order delivery and provide unique offers. When we use the term "personally identifiable information," we mean information that is directly associated with, or could be used to identify, a specific person. Such information includes a name, address, telephone number, e mail address, or information about activities directly linked to that person which would permit the physical or online contacting of that person. 

####  Information You Give Us 

**Checkout:** We collect information you give us — such as your name, billing address, telephone number, e-mail address, and/or credit card number — when you purchase from our Web site. 

**Blog/ News Letter Subscription:** We only collect your email address. 

**CityPASS does not collect personally identifiable information without your consent.**

To see how we use, disclose, and protect the personally identifiable information that we collect, please review the rest of this Policy.

###  2\. Our Use of Personally Identifiable Information 

**Our Internal Use:** CityPASS collects personally identifiable customer information for the purpose of shipping CityPASS to you and/or to contact you directly regarding your order. We also use email addresses on an opt-in basis to provide users with information they have subscribed to. 

**Our Customer Surveys:** Periodically, you may be able to participate in our surveys to help us improve our site and products. Any personally identifiable information that we may collect from you in a survey will ONLY be used internally by CityPASS. And unless otherwise explained in the instructions for a particular customer survey, any personally identifiable information you provide to us for purposes of that survey will be used in accordance with this Policy. 

**Third-Party Use:** CityPASS does not disclose, share or sale personally identifiable information to 3rd parties affiliated or non affiliate. 

* * *

###  3\. Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information 

**Business Transfers:** Information about our users and customers, including personally identifiable information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, or sale of company assets. It may also be disclosed in the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which personally identifiable information would be transferred as one of the business assets of CityPASS. 

* * *

###  4\. Security 

Security of the information regarding your order is very important to us. We use transport security with certificates signed by **Verisign** to protect the security of your online order information from being intercepted by anyone other than CityPASS. You may verify that we are a legitimate Verisign Secure Site by clicking on the Verisign Secured logo in the lower right corner of all checkout pages. 

Once you enter the checkout page, your computer will begin communicating with our server in secure mode. You can tell that you are in secure mode by the following: 

  * In the web address shown in the address window at the top of your browser window, "http" will be replaced by "https".
  * In most browsers, you will see a closed padlock to the right of the address window. You can click on the lock for more security information.



Additionally, citypass.com is tested and certified daily to pass the McAfee SECURE security scan. You can click on the McAfee SECURE logo found on all citypass.com Web pages for more information. Research indicates sites remotely scanned for known vulnerabilities on a daily basis, such as those earning McAfee SECURE certification, can prevent over 99% of hacker crime.

###  5\. Our Use of "Cookies" 

CityPASS uses "cookies" to enhance your use of our Web site. "Cookies" are small text files placed on your computer's hard drive by a Web site when you visit that Web site. These files identify your computer and record your preferences and other data about your visit to a Web site so that when you return to that site, the site operator knows who you are and can personalize your visit. For example, cookies enable a Web site shopping cart to function so that you only have to check out once. Consequently, cookies are often tied to the use of personally identifiable information while using our Web site. If you choose not to accept the use of cookies, your use of our Web site may be impaired. 

Cookies allow us to do the following: 

  * Complete transactions you have requested;
  * Personalize our Web site and make recommendations to you based on products you have shown interest in; and
  * Improve the ease of use of our Web site, sometimes in conjunction with Web beacons.



We do not use cookies to store credit card information. 

We also use a session-based cookie to maintain continuity of navigation for you when viewing our Web site during a particular on-line session. After closing the browser, the session cookie simply terminates; it is not stored on your computer's hard drive thereafter. 

In conjunction with Web beacons, CityPASS may also use cookies, but these cookies are not linked to your personally identifiable information. 

You can enable cookies by doing the following: 

  * **Internet Explorer:** On your task bar menu, select "Tools" and "Internet Options." Then select the "Privacy" tab. Move the slider to any setting other than "High" or "Block All Cookies." Then click "OK."
  * **Mozilla Firefox:** On your task bar menu, select "Tools" and "Options." Select the "Privacy" tab and place a tick mark in the box for "Accept Cookies from Sites." Then click "OK."
  * **Netscape Navigator/Communicator:** On your task bar menu, select "Edit" and "Preferences." Select "Advanced" and click "Accept All Cookies." Then click "OK."
  * **Apple Safari:** On your task bar menu, select "Edit" and "Preferences." Select "Cookies" and then select "Always" in the "Accept Cookies" section.
  * **Google Chrome:** Click the "Tools" menu to the right of the address bar and select "Options." Click on the "Under the Hood" tab, and scroll down to the "Cookie settings:" section. In the drop-down menu, select "Allow all cookies." Then click "Close."

###  6\. Our Use of Web Beacons 

CityPASS uses Web beacons on its Web site. A Web beacon (sometimes called a "Web bug" or "clear GIF") is a tiny graphic image (usually a 1-by-1 pixel) displayed in a Web page, but it is usually invisible, as it is usually the same color as the background of the Web page. When the user's Web browser reads the HTML code for the Web beacon to retrieve the image, it can pass along the IP address of the user's computer, the time the Web beacon was viewed and for how long, and the type of browser used. Web beacons can also be linked to a user's cookies. 

CityPASS uses Web beacons to gather aggregate information. CityPASS does not use Web beacons that link to personally identifiable information. 

For its Web beacons, CityPASS uses Omniture to analyze use of CityPASS's Web site. For further information on how Omniture collects and uses information, you should refer to the Omniture Products and Services Privacy Statement at <http://www.omniture.com/privacy/product>.

###  7\. Our Use of Banner Ads 

We may use third-party advertising companies to place advertisements about CityPASS products on other Web sites. These advertising companies may use cookies, Web beacons, or other technologies to measure the effectiveness of our ads. The advertising companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our and other Web sites in order to measure advertising effectiveness and offer selective ad content. But they use an anonymous identifier, such as a number, to identify you. They do NOT link to or collect any personally identifying information. The use of such cookies, Web beacons, and other technologies is subject to the advertising companies' privacy policies, not the Policy of CityPASS. If you would like more information about the advertising companies we use and their privacy practices, or would like to prevent them from sending and reading cookies on your computer, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

###  8\. Enforcement 

CityPASS regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please contact us with any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or CityPASS's treatment of personal information. When we receive formal written complaints, it is CityPASS's policy to contact the complaining customer or user regarding his or her concerns.

###  9\. Updating of Our Policy 

CityPASS will revise or update this Policy if our practices change, as we change existing services, add new services, or develop better ways to inform you of services we think will interest you. You should refer back to this page for the latest information and the effective date of any changes.
