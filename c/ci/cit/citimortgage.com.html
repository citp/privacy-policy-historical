				<p>Your privacy is important to Citibank. This is why, as a member of Citigroup,
				we are committed to the Citigroup Privacy Promise for Consumers, which is as
				follows:
				<br>
				<br>
				<b><font color="#003399">Citigroup Privacy Promise for Consumers</font></b>
				</p><p>While information is the cornerstone of our ability to provide superior
				service, our most important asset is our customers' trust. Keeping customer
				information secure, and using it only as our customers would want us to, is a
				top priority for all of us at Citigroup. Here then, is our promise to our
				individual customers:
				<br><br>
				</p><ol>
				<li>We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and
				confidentiality, any information our customers share with us.
				<br><br>
				</li><li>We will limit the collection and use of customer information
				to the minimum we require to deliver superior service to our customers,
				which includes advising our customers about our products, services
				and other opportunities, and to administer our business.
				<br><br>
				</li><li>We will permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper
				handling of customer information, to have access to that information.
				Employees who violate our Privacy Promise will
				be subject to our normal disciplinary process. 
				<br><br>
				</li><li>We will not reveal customer information to any external organization
				unless we have previously informed the customer in disclosures or agreements,
				have been authorized by the customer, or are required by law. 
				<br><br>
				</li><li>We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of our customer
				information. We may, however, facilitate relevant offers from reputable
				companies. These companies are not permitted to retain any customer
				information unless the customer has specifically
				expressed interest in their products or services. 
				<br><br>
				</li><li>We will tell customers in plain language initially, and at least once
				annually, how they may remove their names from marketing lists. At any time,
				customers can contact us to remove their names from such lists.
				<br><br>
				</li><li>Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we will
				require them to conform to our privacy standards and to allow us to audit them
				for compliance.
				<br><br>
				</li><li>For purposes of credit reporting, verification and risk management, we
				will exchange information about our customers with reputable
				reference sources and clearinghouse services.
				<br><br>
				</li><li>We will not use or share - internally or externally - personally
				identifiable medical information for any purpose other than the underwriting
				or administration of a customer's policy, claim or account, or as disclosed to
				the customer when the information is collected, or to which the customer
				consents.
				<br><br>
				</li><li>We will attempt to keep customer files complete, up-to-date, and accurate.
				We will tell our customers how and where to conveniently access their account
				information (except when we're prohibited by law) and how to notify us about
				errors which we will promptly correct.
				</li></ol>
				We will continuously assess ourselves to ensure that customer privacy
				is respected. We will conduct our business in a manner that fulfills
				our Promise in the many nations in which we do business.
				<br><br>
				Please also read <a href="privacy.htm">Citibank's Internet Privacy Policy</a>, 
				which outlines our privacy policy for our Internet site users.<p></p></big>
