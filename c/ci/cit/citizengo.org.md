We share this Privacy Policy with you so that you are informed about how we handle your personal information and to tell you about our efforts to keep your information safe and confidential.

Please, find and read carefully what follows so that you understand our policies and practices related to the treatment and management of your personal information. By using or accessing the Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

This policy applies only to information collected through the Site (CitizenGO), and does not apply to information gathered through other affiliated websites, third party web sites or third party applications that can be redirected to our Site or may be accessible from our Site. This policy also applies to the contact from outside the web ("offline") between you and CitizenGO.

This Policy may change over time, (see Changes to Privacy Policy [link]) and the continued use of the Site is implies acceptance of those changes. Please read and review the Policy periodically to stay abreast of any updates. In any case, if we make any substantial changes we will conveniently publicise them on the web and you will be informed by email.

## b) Your Personal Information

In addition to the information you provide, we also collect some additional information to help us improve our campaigns and to better serve our collective mission bridging the gap between the world we have and the world most people want to have. We collect and use the following information:

  * Information you provide by filling in forms in our Site or participating in our online campaigns. This includes information provided by you when you register as a member, sign petitions, send messages to people who headed campaigns through our Site or fill in forms in the CitizenGO website . We may also ask you for additional information when you tell us about a problem concerning our Site.
  * Records and copies of correspondence (including e-mail) when you contact us.
  * Responses to surveys that you have engaged in to help focus our campaigns and activities, or those designed for research purposes. You are not required to answer any of these surveys.
  * Details of transactions you carry out through our site if you are one of the members who out of your generosity supports financially CitizenGO and the work we do together.


  * Certain information on using the CitizenGO site described below in the section Data Monitoring
  * Place in the world (country and sometimes city) from which you communicate, and whether you share CitizenGO campaigns with other people.



  
We do not share the personal information you have provided to us without your express permission, except as stated in this privacy policy.  Additionally, as a standard practice, with your express consent, we share some of your personal data with the following groups:  

  * With world leaders, politicians, mass media and other recipients to whom you send email messages when you choose to use our online tools .
  * With world leaders, politicians, media and the general public when you sign a petition or participate in surveys.
  * With the local partner, a local NGO that represents CitizenGO in your country or region. 



  
What follows tells you more about how we use your personal information in relation to certain types of campaigns.

### **Petitions and Surveys**

For petitions and surveys you've signed or completed, we treat as public information:

  * your name,
  * city,
  * country and
  * comments.



For example, we may provide a summary of the petitions, with your comments, to politicians from around the world, media, interested parties, or to other targets or recipients of our campaigns. We will never publish your address, but we may transmit it to a specific recipient as part of the petition. This information management for petitions and surveys is a routine practice for this type of action. Under no circumstances will we provide your email address or telephone number without your consent. We may also make your comments, alongside with your name, city and country available to the media and the public online. When you authorize us to share your personal e-mail as part of a campaign, CitizenGO is not responsible for the content or use of your e-mail by the recipients of the campaigns.

### **Sending E-mails through CitizenGO**

In certain cases, we use the platform for sending individual email messages to world leaders or other recipients, as well as letters to the editor of various media through our site. These messages are sent in your name, using your e-mail address as sender and your full name and contact information provided as part of the e-mail. These messages will only be sent on your behalf to the extent that you authorize so, each time, using the mail tool on our Site. You alone are responsible for the message(s) you send using our specific e-mail tool. CitizenGO is not responsible for the content or use of your e-mail made by recipients of campaigns

### **Donations**

If you decide to make a donation to CitizenGO, your credit card information will be used only for this transaction through our secure online payment system. CitizenGO will not retain credit card information.

### **Petitions Initiated by Members**

CitizenGO also allows members to develop, implement and create their own campaigns and petitions in our website. Members develop these campaigns on their own behalf and share them with friends, family and others to build a movement. If these petitions demonstrate the ability to generate significant support, CitizenGO could forward it on behalf of the whole CitizenGO community to wider sections of our members. By doing so, CitizenGO could use the information initially provided by the person who initiated the campaign. You can edit or modify this information at your own discretion. While members bear the main responsibility for delivering the petitions to recipients, in some cases CitizenGO can also choose to deliver the petition created by members to the recipients of the campaign.

When people sign up to support the campaigns of CitizenGO members , we collect the information they provide to send communications to these new participants on future campaigns and to promote the goal of CitizenGO. These new participants can always choose to remain as members of CitizenGO or not.

CitizenGO can provide the member who initiated the campaign e-mails from people who have signed it to add value to his effort. When we do this, and as a condition to receiving the emails of those who have signed the campaign, we will require the member who initiated the campaign to give signatories the option to unsubscribe from future emails sent by the member. When members start their own campaigns, CitizenGO can send messages of thanks and other correspondence both on behalf of the member who originally started the campaign, or on behalf of CitizenGO.

## c) Data Security

When you provide your personal information to CitizenGO, we take the steps to ensure that your information is handled securely. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect the security of your information, CitizenGO can not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and in so doing, you do so at your own risk. Once we receive this information, CitizenGO does its best to protect it securely within our systems. The security of your information also depends on you. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password used to access the different sections of our Site, regardless of whether this password has been provided by you or by us. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

Under certain circumstances when we ascertain that members are misusing our systems, or using them in a malicious manner, such activities may be reported to the agencies responsible for enforcing the law. In such cases, CitizenGO may disclose personal information to these agencies, including the name and address.

## d) Children

CitizenGO does not request or collect personal identification information about children. Visitors to the page who are under the age of 13 should seek assistance from their parents or legal guardians when using the Site and should not provide any personal identification information to the Site. For example, visitors under the age of 13 should not make donations, provide their name, address, contact information or other information or use the CitizenGO mail tool .

## e) Cookies

Some sections of the website are password protected. We use cookies (small data files that are generated in the User's Internet browser and are under the control of your browser) to enable you to return to websites that are password protected without having to reenter the key, to optimize experience on the Site by, for example, tracking the type of email that you use, to maximize compatibility with your system Site or for purely analytical purposes that do not involve the identification of the user.

See more detail about the [Cookies](http://www.citizengo.org/en/cookies) Policy of CitizenGO.

## f) Data Tracking URL

URLs addresses Referred to in emails may contain an ID that enables us to recognize the person taking actions on our website. We use these URLs to simplify the process of signing petitions and completing surveys. Sometimes we display a shortened URL that refers to a longer URL with an ID. We do this to simplify the display, to prevent links from becoming broken when copied, and to ensure compatibility with email programs that do not handle long URLs. When a short URL address in shown in an email, you will be able to see the full URL in the address bar of your browser when you access the web page.

## g) Links to Other Web Sites

CitizenGO may provide links to third-party websites and other websites may provide links to our site. The third-party websites operate according to their own terms of use and privacy policy. CitizenGO has no control over these third-party websites, and by using this Site you acknowledge and agree that CitizenGO holds no responsibility for the availability of such third-party websites and does not endorse and is not responsible for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites. You further acknowledge and agree that CitizenGO is not responsible, neither directly nor indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or trust given to any content, advertising, products or other materials in such sites or available from them.

## h) Access and correction of your Personal Information

You can review and update your personal information by accessing the website and visiting your account profile page and making any changes there. If after attempting to register you were not able to do so because you have forgotten your password, you have the option to click on the link "Forgot Password" and this will lead you to a page where you can provide your email address.
