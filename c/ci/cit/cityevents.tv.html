              <p>Cityevents.tv / talentfinder.tv is very concerned with protecting your  personal integrity when you use Cityevents.tv / talentfinder.tv. This Privacy  Policy states how we handle your personal information. We are very cautious  that the personal information that you give to us is handled in such a way that  your personal integrity will not be infringed. With this Privacy Policy we aim  to provide you with information regarding the technical handling of your  personal information. </p>
        <p>The Privacy Policy is incorporated in the Terms of Use Agreement and by  approving the Terms of Use Agreement you also approve of this Privacy Policy.  Therefore, when you ratify the conditions of the Terms of Use Agreement you  also consent to granting us the authority to collect, use, process and disclose  information relating to you in accordance with this Privacy Policy and  according to applicable laws. If you do not agree to all of these terms and  conditions, you should not use Cityevents.tv / talentfinder.tv and provide us  with any information. </p>
        <p>All personal information submitted by Cityevents.tv / talentfinder.tv users  such as name, address, email address and age etc. is collected by us and can be  used to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating  to, but not limited to Cityevents.tv / talentfinder.tv, events, contests and  special offers. </p>
        <p>In compliance with the general practice of, for example, commercial Websites  we also collect information about you that can not directly be referred to you.  This type of information includes for example the IP-address of the computer  you use, profile information, aggregate user data and browser type. This type  of information is logged both from Members and visitors to Cityevents.tv /  talentfinder.tv. The collected information is used to further develop the  services provided by us and make them more user-friendly and better adapted to  the needs and tastes of the Cityevents.tv / talentfinder.tv users. The  non-personally-identifiable information may be used for improvements and  administration of the Website and, it may also be used to analyze trends, to  follow the movements of users around the services or to gather demographic  information about the users as a collective. This non-personally-identifiable  information may be shared with third-parties in order to provide more relevant  services and advertisements adapted to the Cityevents.tv / talentfinder.tv  users. However, we will not use the non- personally-identifiable information  collected to market directly to the specific user. User IP-addresses are  recorded for security and monitoring purposes. </p>
        <p>In order to follow and analyze the movements and interests of our users, we  use pixel tags that are tiny graphic images that tell us what parts of the Cityevents.tv  / talentfinder.tv services that have been visited. The pixel tags are also used  to measure how effective the searches are that the users perform on our  services and they can also be used to enable us to send emails in a format each  user can read. Pixel tags are also used by us to trace whether emails have been  opened and we do this to protect our users from unwanted messages. All pixel  tag information is stored in a secure database. </p>
        <p>Information relating to Member Profiles such as pictures and username is  displayed to other Cityevents.tv / talentfinder.tv users in order to make user  interaction in the Community easier. However, the Member`s full name is never  directly revealed to other Members. </p>
        <p>The email addresses collected by us from the Members may be used to send  news about the services such as updates and newsletters, etc. The emails sent  by us may contain a "click-through URL" link that leads to contents  on the Cityevents.tv / talentfinder.tv. When the URL's are clicked they pass  through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. The  "click-through URL" is tracked by us in order for us to make our  services more effective and better adapted to the user`s interests. Therefore,  if you do not want to be tracked by us, we kindly ask you not to click any  links in emails sent to you by us. </p>
        <p>As stated in the Terms of Use Agreement we and/or our partners may sponsor  promotions, sweepstakes or contests on the Cityevents.tv / talentfinder.tv  services. When participating in any of these events you may be asked for  personal information such as your name or email address phone number . In some  cases you may also be asked to answer questions in order to participate. We may  transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly  requested to receive information from. If this is the case it will be clearly  stated at the point of your participation who is collecting the personal  information and whose privacy statement or what regulation will apply. </p>

        <h2 style="color:#CC9900; font-size:18px;">SECURITY </h2>
        <p>The safety of your personal information is a high priority for us. All  Member accounts are secured by passwords. The information on your account can  only be accessed by you and our employees that need access in order to fulfill  their job functions, such as technical staff and customer service personnel.  Although we have taken great measures to protect your privacy, we can not  guarantee the security of your account information. Therefore, it is important  that you take precautions to protect your personal data by, for example,  choosing a password consisting both numbers and letters, and by changing your  password often. Of course you must also use a secure web browser. Technical  failure, unauthorized use or entry, and other factors may lead to a security  breach of member information at any time. </p>
        <h2 style="color:#CC9900; font-size:18px;">SHARING AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
        <p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose  personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is  necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena,  search warrant or other legal process received by us, whether or not a response  is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the Terms of Use Agreement or to  protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of Members, of the public and  visitors of Cityevents.tv / talentfinder.tv. We reserve the right to transfer  personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that  information as a result of the sale of the Website or the Company or  substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest. </p>
        <p>We do not sell or rent your contact information to other marketers. To help  us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with our  entities that will safeguard it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. There  are also times when it may be advantageous for us to make certain personal  information about you available to companies that we have a strategic  relationship with or that perform work for us to provide products and services  to you on our behalf. These companies may help us to process information,  deliver products to you, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer  service, assess your interest in our products and services, or conduct customer  research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are also obligated to protect  your personal information in accordance with our policies. Without such  information being made available, it would be difficult for you to purchase  products, have products delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us  with feedback to improve our products and services, or access certain services,  offers, and contents on Cityevents.tv / talentfinder.tv. </p>
        <h2 style="color:#CC9900; font-size:18px;">PRIVACY OF CHILDREN </h2>
