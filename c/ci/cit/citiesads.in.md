**Information We Collect**

In order to ensure that consumers get the very best service, CitiesAds. ie collects demographic information, web pages visited and other consumer-volunteered information from sources such as forms, survey information and/or site registrations.

Collected information is used to improve the content of our website, customize the content and/or layout of our website for individual users, and to contact users for marketing purposes as well as route requests to our auto dealer network, fulfillment and marketing partners. Should you request an autoloan quote, such information will be distributed to our partners for credit checks and loan approval.
