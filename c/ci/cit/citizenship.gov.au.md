# Privacy

  


## Privacy statement

The _Privacy Act 1988_ defines personal information as 'information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion'.

This website is managed by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC). We take seriously our obligation to protect your privacy.

The _Privacy Act 1988_ is the key law designed to protect your rights and prevent misuse of personal information collected by government agencies such as this department. 

Also, information received by us is protected from unauthorised use and disclosure by virtue of specific provisions in the _Migration Act 1958_ , _Crimes Act 1914_ , _Public Service Act 1999_ and the _Public Service Regulations 1999_.

A breach of these laws may make an officer liable to criminal and/or civil penalty.

We do not collect personal information about you when you visit this site. You can generally visit this site without telling us who you are, unless you choose to provide such information.

Our website contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the content and the privacy practices of other websites and we encourage you to read each site's privacy policy.

## Security of information

The _Privacy Act 1988_ has specific provisions that prohibit any officer of this department (or any other government department) from collecting, using or disclosing anyone's personal information except in performing their duties and in specific situations permitted by law. 

Your personal information will not be disclosed unless the law permits it or your permission is given.

While we provide a secure environment, you should be aware there are inherent risks associated with the transmission of information via the Internet.
