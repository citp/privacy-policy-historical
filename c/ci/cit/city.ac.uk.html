      <p>City University, London (referred to in this document as ‘the 
      University’) is committed to protecting your privacy and developing 
      technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. 
      This University Privacy Statement applies to the University and its group 
      of websites (www.city.ac.uk and collective virtual sites – www.<i>name</i>.city.ac.uk) 
      and governs data collection and usage at all the University sites and 
      services worldwide. By using the University websites, you consent to the 
      data practices described in this statement.</p>
      <p>This privacy statement applies to all the University sites and 
      services. Please read the complete University Privacy Statement below.</p>
      <h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica" color="#006666">Collection of your personal information and the Data Protection Act 
      1998<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
      <p>At some sites, the University collects personally identifiable 
      information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or 
      telephone number. At other sites, the University collects anonymous 
      demographic information, which is not unique to you. Some sites collect a 
      combination of the two types of information. Information collected at one 
      of the University’s websites may be shared within the University as a 
      whole including the University’s group of websites. Personal and 
      demographic data may be stored and processed outside your country (if 
      outside the United Kingdom) and by using the University’s website, you 
      consent to any such transfers being made outside your country.</p>
      <p>There is also information about your computer hardware and software 
      that is automatically collected by the University and may be shared with 
      other websites within the University’s group of websites. This information 
      can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and 
      referring website addresses. This information is used by the University 
      for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and 
      to provide general statistics regarding use of the University websites.</p>
      <p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally 
      identifiable information or personally sensitive data through the 
      University’s website, you are encouraged to review the privacy statements 
      of websites you choose to link to from the University’s website so that 
      you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your 
      information. The University is not responsible for the privacy statements 
      or other content on websites outside of the University and the 
      University’s group of websites.</p>
      <h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica" color="#006666">Use of your personal information<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
      <p>The University’s websites collect and use your personal information to 
      operate the University websites and deliver the services you have 
      requested. The University may also contact you via surveys to conduct 
      research about your opinion of current services or of potential new 
      services that may be offered.</p>
      <p>The University does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third 
      parties. The University may share data with trusted partners to help us 
      perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide 
      customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are 
      prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these 
      services to the University, and they are required to maintain the 
      confidentiality of your information.</p>
      <p>The University does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, 
      such as race or religion, without your explicit consent.</p>
      <p>The University keeps track of the websites and pages that our customers 
      visit within the University, in order to determine what University sites 
      and services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customised 
      content within the University to customers whose browsing behaviour 
      indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>
      <p>The University will disclose your personal information, without notice, 
      only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such 
      action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with 
      legal process served on the University or the site; (b) protect and defend 
      the rights or property of the University and its group of websites and, 
      (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of 
      users of the University, its websites, or the public.</p>
      <h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica" color="#006666">Use of cookies<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
      <p>The University’s websites may use "cookies" to help you personalise 
      your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your 
      hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or 
      deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, 
      and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie 
      to you.</p>
      <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience 
      feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web 
      server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you 
      personalise the University pages, a cookie helps the University to recall 
      your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the 
      process of recording your personal information, delivery addresses, and so 
      on. When you return to the same University website, the information you 
      previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the University 
      features that you customised.</p>
      <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers 
      automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser 
      setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline 
      cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features 
      of the University services or websites you visit.</p>
      <h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica" color="#006666">Security of your personal information<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
      <p>The University secures your personal information from unauthorized 
      access, use or disclosure. The University secures the personally 
      identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, 
      secure environment, protected from unauthorised access, use or disclosure. 
      When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted, 
      it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket 
      Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
      <h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica" color="#006666">Changes to this statement<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
      <p>The University will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to 
      reflect customer feedback. The University encourages you to periodically 
      review this Statement to be informed of how the University is protecting 
      your information.</p>
      <h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica" color="#006666">Contact information<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
      <p>The University welcomes your comments regarding this Privacy Statement. 
      If you believe that the University has not adhered to this Statement, 
      please contact the University by <a href="mailto:E.G.Martin@city.ac.uk">
      e-mail</a>. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly 
      determine and remedy the problem.<br>
