For a list of all of IAC's businesses, please visit [www.iac.com](http://www.iac.com/ "http://www.iac.com/"). In order to help customers clearly understand our data collection and use practices, IAC has decided to have its businesses follow a standard set of privacy practices and use a standard format to describe their privacy practices.

Refer to our [FAQs](https://web.archive.org/templates/profile/policy_faq.html "Privacy Policy FAQs") for details about the changes.
