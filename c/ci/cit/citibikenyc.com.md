**Information We Collect**  


The types of personal information we may collect include:

  * Contact information (such as name, postal address, email address and telephone number);
  * date of birth;
  * gender;
  * login credentials;
  * payment information (such as your payment card number, expiration date, authorization number or security code, delivery address and billing address);
  * your geographic location, in connection with your use of the Sites or the Service;
  * photographs, comments and other content you provide.



In addition, when you use the Service, we may obtain system data, including information such as your geographic location, trip duration, start and stop time and date, start and end station name, station ID number, station latitude and longitude, bicycle ID number and user type (such as annual member).

_**Information We Collect By Automated Means**_

In addition, when you visit our Sites, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies, web beacons and web server logs. The information we collect in this manner includes IP address, unique device identifier, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our Sites, and dates and times of visits to the Sites. A “cookie” is a file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Through these automated collection methods, we obtain “clickstream data,” which is a log of the links and other content on which a visitor clicks while browsing the Sites. As the visitor clicks through the Sites, a record of the action may be collected and stored. We may link certain data elements we have collected through automated means, such as your browser information, with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an email we sent to you. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Sites. When you use the Sites, neither we nor any third parties collect personal information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites. Our Sites are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers.

We may use third-party analytics services on the Sites, such as those of Google Analytics. The information obtained for this purpose (including your IP address and other information collected by automated means) will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers. To learn about opting out of Google Analytics, please [click here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout "https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout").

The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our Sites, such as social media sharing tools, also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information is collected directly by the providers of the features and is subject to the privacy policies or notices of these providers. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Motivate is not responsible for these providers’ information practices.

**How We Use the Information We Collect**

We may use the information described above to:

  * Comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards, contractual obligations and our policies.
  * Protect against, identify and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, claims and other liabilities; and
  * Transition from one operator to another (for example, if Motivate ceases to operate the Sites or the Service);
  * Verify your identity;
  * Operate, evaluate and improve our business (including developing new products and services; monitoring, enhancing and improving our systems and services; managing our communications; analyzing our products and customer base; performing data analytics; and performing accounting, auditing and other internal functions);
  * Respond to your inquiries;
  * Promote government or bicycling-related services and programs;
  * Communicate with you about, and administer your participation in, special events, contests, sweepstakes, programs, offers, surveys and market research;
  * Send you promotional materials and other communications;
  * Process your payments;
  * Create and manage your account;
  * Provide products and services to you, such as to allow you to obtain a bicycle



In addition, we use information collected through cookies, web beacons, pixels, web server logs and other automated means for purposes such as (i) customizing our users’ visits to our Sites, (ii) delivering content tailored to our users’ interests and the manner in which our users browse our Sites, and (iii) managing our Sites and other aspects of our business.

We also may use the information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.

**Information We Share**

We do not disclose personal information we collect about you, except as described in this Privacy Notice. We may share your personal information with service providers who perform services on our behalf. We do not authorize these service providers to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may share your information with (i) our subsidiaries and affiliates, (ii) joint marketing partners or other co-branded third parties, (iii) municipalities and other relevant government agencies associated with the Service, and (iv) sponsors (such as employers that provide discounted rates for employees).

We also may share information with other public and private organizations for statistical and research purposes. We reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).

In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, (iii) to enforce or exercise our rights under our agreements with users or to investigate or defend against any action or allegation against us, or (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity.

**Your Choices**

We offer you certain choices in connection with the personal information we collect about you, such as how we communicate with you. To ask us to remove your information from our mailing lists or submit a request, please contact us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Privacy Notice. You can also unsubscribe from our mailing lists by following the “Unsubscribe” link in our emails.

**How We Protect Personal Information**

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.

**Links To Third-Party Websites, Apps and Services**

For your convenience and information, our Sites may provide links to third-party websites, apps and services that may be operated by companies not affiliated with Motivate. These companies may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any non-Motivate websites, apps or services.

**Updates To Our Privacy Notice**

This Privacy Notice may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our personal information practices. For significant changes, we will notify you by posting a prominent notice on the Sites indicating at the top of the Notice when it was most recently updated.
