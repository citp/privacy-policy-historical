# Privacy Policy

Cityfeet.com is committed to visitor privacy, and we ensure this commitment in a number of ways. You are encouraged to read the following information about our Privacy Policy. Contact us with any questions you might have on the subject by calling 212.924.6450, or by emailing us at [info@cityfeet.com](mailto:info@cityfeet.com).

Cityfeet.com's web site is divided into public and private (secure) pages. Public pages are solely informational resources, and you will not be asked to provide any personal data to enter these pages. Cookies (devices that are used to track user information and then used to customize web pages) are used on public pages in order to enhance your user session. For example, a cookie might track which city a user visits through the site, and then store the city's home page as a cookie. Absolutely no sensitive information is tracked through cookie use.

Cityfeet.com does not share, sell, rent or lease user information to any third party. All information provided on our secure, private pages are used for internal purposes only. While Cityfeet.com strives to work only with other sites that provide similar privacy policies, we cannot be responsible for the practices of other sites that are found through links on Cityfeet.com.

Pages on which the visitor is asked personal information are completely secured by using SSL, or a Secure Sockets Layer. SSL encrypts any data you provide, and it is thus made inaccessible to anyone who is unauthorized to view the information. The security of our private pages has been acknowledged by Comodo Group (www.comodogroup.com), a leading Certification Authority (CA). Comodo's digital certificate has been issued to Cityfeet.com, and it is posted on our secure pages.
