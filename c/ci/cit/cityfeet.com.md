Cityfeet provides a variety of online services for commercial real estate professionals. Cityfeet values your privacy, feedback and candor very highly. Any user information we collect is considered private and we do not use it or share it except as permitted herein, without the user's permission. We use this personal information at Cityfeet to provide the best quality service possible. The following privacy statement summarizes Cityfeet's protection and use of any personal information provided by visitors to the Cityfeet site.

This statement does not apply to any public area of Cityfeet's web site or services. In the event you submit personal information to contact another member, contact a lister about a listing, create a listing, add a contact on a listing, Cityfeet Answers, Professional Directory, Professional Profile, Cityfeet Profile, such information becomes publicly available and Cityfeet is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit to these services, forums, listings, or persons.

Information Collected by Cityfeet:

Cityfeet collects user information from several areas of the Cityfeet site including the 'New Member Registration' area (where Cityfeet collects each user's name, street address, telephone number, email address, and self-selected primary role in real estate); products; business services; the adding and editing of property listings; the adding and editing of Professional Profiles; email forms; and any surveys or contests that Cityfeet may sponsor. Cityfeet collects individual user search activity for statistical, archival, and business purposes. Cityfeet collects financial information (such as billing address, credit card number, expiration date) for billing payment and credit card authorization purposes. Cityfeet may track the IP address of a user's computer or place a "cookie" in the browser files of a user's computer. This is required by Cityfeet services to provide automated features.

Use of Information Collected:

Collected information helps Cityfeet better understand its users' needs in order to improve its product and service offerings. Email addresses are used to communicate with members through LoopNews (a weekly email news summary), Promotional emails, Partner emails and for site administration purposes. Users may be deleted from LoopNews, Promotional email and Partner email lists at their request. Personal information may be used to contact users for the purpose of research, product development, marketing, or customer service, if the user has opted to receive such communication. User search activity is collected and analyzed and may be utilized by Cityfeet in the aggregate or in the abstract for a variety of business purposes. Financial information is used to bill users for products and services purchased. Within Cityfeet, only accounting managers have access to the credit card account information. This information is not shared with anyone outside of Cityfeet. IP address and cookie log data is analyzed to better understand traffic flows and user preferences. Cityfeet may retain the data it collects indefinitely. You may have your personal information deleted or deactivated by sending an email to [privacy@loopnet.com](mailto:privacy@loopnet.com). You may be asked to confirm your identity. You will receive a response within 10 business days.

Use of Email Tools:

You may NOT use the Email The Broker, Email a Listing service or other email services that we offer to send spam (i.e. unsolicited commercial email) or otherwise send content that would violate Cityfeet's Terms and Conditions. We may monitor, track or save the use of this feature, but will be under no obligation to monitor, track or save these email messages sent from these tools. If you send and email using the Email This Item to a Friend service to an email address that is not registered in our system, we do not use that email address for any purpose other than to send your email, and for us to automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Cityfeet stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and for tracking the success of our referral program. We also do not rent or sell these email addresses of un-registered users.

Your friend may contact us at [privacy@loopnet.com](mailto:privacy@loopnet.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

Shared information:

Though Cityfeet makes every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

Cityfeet shares member information in the following areas on the site: Listing Service, Email Alerts and Professional Directory. When a member enters a sale or lease listing in the Listing Service, listing contact information is also entered. During this process, the listing submitter is able to view other members' contact information when he adds another contact beside himself to the listing. In addition, members searching Cityfeet can view contact information (name, email and phone number) when they view a property listing profile. Cityfeet allows users to share contact information with one another via its Email Alerts service. With Email Alerts users can save their property search criteria to have information about properties that match the specified criteria emailed to them. When selecting this service, users are given the option of releasing their contact information to other users who have property listings that match their criteria. This contact information is then shared with the users who have property listings that match the buying or leasing criteria. Unless required by law as detailed in this section or a user specifically takes action as discussed in this paragraph, Cityfeet does not share individual user search activity information and such activity information remains private to the individual user and to Cityfeet. Professional Profile users agree to share their contact information and allow all Cityfeet users to view their contact information via the Cityfeet Professional Directory or via links made available to users on a listing or in an email. Cityfeet users who do not opt out of the Professional Directory service during registration with Cityfeet (or anytime thereafter) also agree to share their contact information via the Cityfeet Professional Directory.

Cityfeet shares information with its partners for the purpose of providing related services in which we deem our users have interest. The use that Cityfeet's partners make of customer information will not exceed Cityfeet's use of the data. Key billing information (such as credit card number, expiration date and dollar amount) gathered from users making online purchases of products or services is shared with VeriSign, our credit card processing partner, in order to authorize charges to the credit card. Cityfeet also uses third party providers to perform email and postal mailings on behalf of Cityfeet, but this information (such as name, address and email) is confidential and is not used by the provider for any other purpose.

Cityfeet does not rent or lease user information to any third party, except as disclosed here. From time to time, Cityfeet may obtain information (such as electronic mail addresses) from third party providers. It is our goal to only contact individuals who we believe may have a legitimate business interest in Cityfeet based on their membership or participation in other organizations or web sites, and who have indicated a willingness to be contacted for this purpose. While Cityfeet endeavors to work with other sites and companies with a similar respect for user privacy, Cityfeet cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites.

Please be aware that in the event Cityfeet merges with a third party, or in the event all or substantially all of Cityfeet's assets are acquired by a third party, customer information, including personal information, will be shared and/or transferred to such third party. The information may only be used or shared by such third parties for the primary purpose for which the information was originally collected. If such third parties, or if Cityfeet for its own business needs, desire to use the personal information for another purpose, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information prior to the information being used for a new purpose, and you will have the opportunity to opt out of such new use of your personal information.

Security of personal information:

Cityfeet's clients and their personal information are considered to be Cityfeet's greatest asset and thus their privacy is treated with the utmost regard and respect. Cityfeet takes every reasonable precaution to secure personal information within both its computers and its physical premises.

The security of your personal information is important to Cityfeet. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). [To learn more about SSL, follow this link [http://www.verisign.com](http://www.verisign.com/)].

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
