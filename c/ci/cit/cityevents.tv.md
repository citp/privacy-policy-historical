In compliance with the general practice of, for example, commercial Websites we also collect information about you that can not directly be referred to you. This type of information includes for example the IP-address of the computer you use, profile information, aggregate user data and browser type.

In order to follow and analyze the movements and interests of our users, we use pixel tags that are tiny graphic images that tell us what parts of the Cityevents.tv / talentfinder.tv services that have been visited. The pixel tags are also used to measure how effective the searches are that the users perform on our services and they can also be used to enable us to send emails in a format each user can read.

The email addresses collected by us from the Members may be used to send news about the services such as updates and newsletters, etc. The emails sent by us may contain a "click-through URL" link that leads to contents on the Cityevents.tv / talentfinder.tv. When the URL's are clicked they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. The "click-through URL" is tracked by us in order for us to make our services more effective and better adapted to the user`s interests. Therefore, if you do not want to be tracked by us, we kindly ask you not to click any links in emails sent to you by us.
