Citizens Energy Group understands that security and privacy are important issues for visitors to our web site, CITIZENSENERGYGROUP.COM (the "Site") and recognizes our obligations to keep your information secure and confidential. That is why we maintain the standards outlined below to help protect information that personally identifies you. Citizens Energy Group collects information from our users at several different points on our Site. We do this to understand how to better serve our customers.

You may be asked to voluntarily provide your name, billing address, credit card information, phone number, utility account number, email address or other personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") to have access to some features of the Site. By using the Site and providing us with your Personal Information, you consent to our use of such information as described in this Policy. You may always refuse to provide your Personal Information, and this may lead to our inability to provide you with certain products or services. We or our business partners may also collect information that is anonymous, such as your IP number (a number used to identify your computer on the Internet) or the type of browser you are using ("Anonymous Information"), through the use of cookies or by other means. We hope that, by using Anonymous Information, we can update the Site to make it more useful to you and other users.

## Registration

We require Citizens Energy Group customers to register so that we may create unique user ID and password (login) information.
