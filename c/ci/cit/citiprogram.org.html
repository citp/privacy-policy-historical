  	 <p><text-medium style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Privacy Notice</strong></text-medium></p>
 <p> Your privacy is important  to the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program). &nbsp;In general, our policy is to collect, use, and  disclose only the personally identifiable information necessary for you to  appropriately access CITI Program content, either as specified by the CITI  Program subscriber institution(s) with which you are affiliated (as an  Affiliated Learner) or, if you are an "unaffiliated" learner  (Independent Learner), as you may yourself specify.</p>
<p>Registration as a  CITI Program learner (website user) requires provision of certain personal  information, and use of the website results in collection of certain  identifiable data as described below.&nbsp;  Subscriber institutions may also provide personal information to CITI  Program directly about their Affiliated Learners.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>When you access  any web-based materials, computer systems hosting that content will  automatically "log" (record) data about your session using standard  monitoring technology. This includes, but is not limited to: the domain name  (DNS name) and Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you used; the  operating system and browser on that computer, including some details about the  configuration of each; the time, date and duration of your access, including  all web pages you visited during your session; and the "referring"  location (the site you visited just prior to your arrival at the CITI Program  website).</p>

<p>CITI Program  websites may use "cookies" (tracking files) installed on your  computer to assist in delivering content specific to your interests and  preferences (e.g., in your preferred language). Your web browser (Chrome,  Explorer, Firefox, Safari, etc.) allows you to be warned when cookies are being  placed on your computer or to refuse all cookies. However, not accepting or  disabling cookies will prevent you from accessing certain CITI Program site  content and functions.</p>

<p>Some areas of the  CITI Program site are "private" and may be accessed only after login  with an assigned username and password. In order to assure the integrity of  data regarding learners' education progress, CITI Program tracks the individual  sessions of all logged-in users, including details of course content viewing  and quiz question responses. This information is stored in a database of  learner records.</p>

<p>Details of these learner  records may be provided to the subscriber institution(s) with which a learner  is affiliated at the institution’s request, including reports of course  completions and quiz scores. Such results may become part of the learner's  educational records at those institutions, and subject to legal protections for  such information. Contact the institution(s) with which you are affiliated for  their privacy policies.</p>

<p>For non-logged-in  users accessing "public" areas of the site, we monitor page views and  other utilization statistics, as described above, but only in the aggregate such  that individually identifying information is not collected and stored, in order  to improve hardware and software performance and to gauge the usefulness of  such content.</p>

<p><strong>Information You Provide</strong></p>

<p>In addition to  information collected by standard monitoring technology, some parts of the CITI  Program websites may ask you to provide personal information, such as during  the Learner Registration process to obtain a CITI Program username and password.  You will know when you are sharing personal information with us because you  will need to send a message, fill out a form or application or survey, and then  agree to provide this information to us by clicking a "submit" or  "send" button.</p>

<p>These online  forms, applications, and surveys may ask you to provide personal information  like contact information (e.g., home address or email addresses or phone  numbers), unique identifiers (e.g., employee or student ID number at your  institution), or financial information (e.g., account or credit card numbers).  If you choose to share personal information with us, we will use or disclose it  only for the purposes you or the subscriber institution(s) with which you are  affiliated have authorized by accepting the <a href="index.cfm?pageID=259"><strong>Terms of Service</strong></a> for CITI Program access. </p>

<p>Personal  information may be used to configure your experience as a learner (e.g.,  selection of courses), respond to requests for information or materials for  you, or to contact you when necessary or requested by institutions with which  you are affiliated. Unique identifiers are collected to verify your identity in  CITI Program record systems and for data transfers to the subscriber  institution(s) with which you are affiliated. Financial information that is  collected is used to bill you for products and services you have requested  independently of those purchased by the institution(s) with which you are  affiliated.</p>

<p>Some of the  information that we collect or that you provide may be saved for a designated  or indefinite period of time. We will not disclose the information except for  support of CITI Program's educational activities (e.g., course completion data  sent to subscriber institutions with which you are affiliated), nor disclose it  to third parties or government agencies, unless required to do so by state or  federal law or to protect the integrity, safety, and security of our websites.</p>

<p><strong>Information Related to Minors</strong></p>

<p>CITI Program does  not knowingly create accounts for nor collect information from minors under 18  years of age without parental consent or parental notification. CITI Program  accounts are not knowingly provided to any persons under 13 years of age under  any circumstances.&nbsp; For information, see  the <a href="index.cfm?pageID=259"><strong>Terms of Service</strong></a>. </p>


<p><strong>Mail and Other Communications</strong></p>

<p>Information you  send us in electronic mail or via chat messaging services (such as when  communicating with the CITI Program Help Desk) is not immune from interception  or transmission errors. We generally recommend that any communications  involving sensitive personal information be via postal mail or telephone. (And,  in general, we recommend that you keep communications of sensitive information  to a minimum, whatever medium you use.&nbsp;  For example, you should not put passwords in any emails.) Where  sensitive information must be transmitted electronically, CITI Program uses  security mechanisms such as encryption to protect information where such  measures are available.</p>

<p><strong>Opt Outs for Communications</strong></p>

<p>CITI Program  websites and electronic communications such as newsletters provide you with  opportunities to opt out of receiving communications from us, unless it is a  mandated communication authorized by the subscriber institution(s) with which  you have affiliated, or such communication is necessary in support of your  educational activities (e.g., a course completion report, or a reminder about a  course expiration). Opt-out requests will be processed within ten (10) business  days or fewer. </p>

<p><strong>Websites External to the CITI Program</strong></p>

<p>CITI  Program websites and educational materials may contain links to external sites  that are not part of the CITI Program. Such links are provided for the  convenience of CITI Program users.&nbsp; <strong>Please be aware that CITI Program makes no  representations about the safety or reliability of any other website. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;CITI Program recommends  that users exercise their own skill and care with respect to their use of the  CITI Program website or any other site, and carefully evaluate the accuracy,  currency, completeness, and relevance of the material on the website or on any  linked site.&nbsp; <strong>CITI Program has no direct control over the content of the linked sites,  or the changes that may occur to the content on those sites.</strong> CITI Program  is not responsible for the content or reliability of links, or for any loss or  inconvenience arising from their use. &nbsp;Providing links to external  websites does not constitute an endorsement or a recommendation of any material  on those sites or of any third party products or services offered by, from, or  through those sites. Users of links provided by this website are responsible  for being aware of which organization is hosting the website they visit.&nbsp; Users are encouraged to take appropriate and  adequate precautions to ensure that whatever is selected from this or any site  is free of viruses or other contamination that may interfere with or damage the  user's computer system, software or data. </p>
  CITI Program is  also not responsible for the privacy policies, practices, or content of CITI  Program subscriber institutions with which you are affiliated, nor those of  other business partners of these institutions, nor of any other organizations that  may retransmit CITI Program materials from their own systems, even if the CITI  Program brand or logo appears on those sites.<p></p>
