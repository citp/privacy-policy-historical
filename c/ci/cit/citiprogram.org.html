  	 <p><text-medium style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Privacy Notice</strong></text-medium></p><p>Your privacy is very important to us. In general, our policy is to collect only the personally identifiable information necessary for you to appropriately access CITI Program content, either as specified by the CITI Program subscriber institution(s) with which you are affiliated, or, if you are an "unaffiliated" (independent) learner, as you yourself have specified.<br><br>No personally identifiable information about you is collected when you visit CITI Program's websites unless you actively choose to make such information available to us. <br><br><strong>Information We Collect</strong><br><br>When you access any web-based materials, computer systems hosting that content will automatically "log" (record) data about your session using standard monitoring technology. That includes, but is not limited to: the domain name (DNS name) and Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you used; the operating system and browser on that computer, including some details about the configuration of each; the time, date and duration of your access, including all pages you visited during your session; and the "referring" location (the site you visited just prior to your arrival).<br><br>CITI Program websites may also use "cookies" (tracking files) installed on your computer to assist in delivering content specific to your interests and preferences (e.g., in your preferred language). Your web browser (Chrome, Explorer, Firefox, etc.) allows you to be warned when cookies are being placed on your computer or to refuse all cookies. However, not accepting or disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing certain CITI Program site content or functions.<br><br>Some areas of the CITI Program site are "private" and may be accessed only after login with an assigned username and password. In order to assure the integrity of data regarding learners' education progress, CITI Program tracks the individual sessions of all logged-in users, including details of course content viewing and quiz question responses. This information is stored in a database of learner records.<br><br>Details of these learner records may be provided to the subscriber institution(s) with which a learner is affiliated on the latter's request, including reports of course completions and quiz scores. Such results may become part of the learner's educational records at those institutions, and subject to legal protections for such information. Contact the institution(s) with which you are affiliated for their policies.<br><br>For non-logged-in users accessing "public" areas of the site, we monitor page views and other utilization statistics, as described above, but only in the aggregate, in order to improve hardware and software performance and to gauge the usefulness of such content.<br><br><strong>Information You Provide</strong><br><br>In addition to information collected by standard monitoring technology, some parts of CITI Program websites may ask you to provide personal information, such as during the Learner Registration process to obtain a CITI Program username and password. You will know when you are sharing personal information with us because you will need to send a message, fill out a form or application or survey, and then agree to provide this information to us by clicking a "submit" or "send" button.<br><br>These online forms, applications and surveys may ask you to provide personal information like contact information (e.g., home or e-mail addresses or phone numbers), unique identifiers (e.g., employee/student ID number at your institution), or, rarely, financial information (e.g., account or credit card numbers). If you choose to share personal information with us, we will use it only for the purposes you or the subscriber institution(s) with which you are affiliated have authorized. <br><br>Personal information may be used to configure your experience as a learner (e.g., selection of courses), respond to requests for information or materials for you, or to contact you when necessary or requested. Unique identifiers are collected to verify your identity in CITI Program record systems and for data transfers to the subscriber institution(s) with which you are affiliated. Financial information that is collected is used to bill you for products and services you have requested independently of those purchased by the institution(s) with which you are affiliated.<br><br>Some of the information that we collect or that you provide may be saved for a designated or indefinite period of time. We will not disclose the information except for support of CITI Program's educational activities (e.g., course completion data sent to subscriber institutions with which you are affiliated), nor disclose it to third parties or government agencies, unless required to do so by state or federal law or to protect the integrity, safety, and security of our websites.<br><br><strong>Websites External to the CITI Program</strong><br><br>This site contains links to external sites that are not part of the CITI Program. Such links are provided for the convenience of CITI Program users. We are not responsible for, and make no representations about, the privacy policies, practices or content of such websites. For your own protection, you should check the individual privacy policies of external sites. <br><br>CITI Program is also not responsible for the privacy policies, practices or content of CITI Program subscriber institutions with which you are affiliated, nor those of other business partners of these institutions, nor of any other organizations which may retransmit CITI materials from their own systems, even if the CITI Program brand appears on those sites.<br><br><strong>Electronic Mail and Chat Communications</strong> <br><br>Information you send us in electronic mail or via chat messaging services (such as when communicating with the CITI Program Help Desk) is not immune from interception or transmission errors. We generally recommend that any communications involving sensitive personal information be via postal mail or telephone. (And, in general, we recommend that you keep communications of sensitive information to a minimum, whatever medium you use.) Where sensitive information must be transmitted electronically, CITI Program uses security mechanisms such as encryption to protect information when available.<br><br><strong>Communication Opt Outs</strong><br><br>CITI Program websites and electronic communications such as newsletters provide you with the opportunity to opt out of receiving subsequent communications from us, unless the subscriber institution(s) with which you have affiliated have mandated a type of communication, or such communication is necessary in support of your educational activities (e.g., a course completion report, or a reminder about a course expiration). Opt-out requests will be processed within ten (10) business days or fewer.<br><br><strong>Guidelines for Minors</strong><br><br>CITI Program does not knowingly collect online contact information from minors under 18 years of age without prior parental consent or parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and/or participation in the activity.<br><br>In the absence of prior parental consent, online information will only be used to respond directly to the minor's request. Such information will not be used for other purposes without prior parental consent. We do not distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information without prior parental consent. We do not give the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent. We do not offer special games, prizes or other activities to entice users to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity. We will, however, provide personal information collected about minors if required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or a subpoena, or to protect the integrity, safety and security of our websites. <br><br><strong>Additional Information</strong><br><br>For additional information about CITI Program privacy practices, please contact:<br><br>CITI Program<br>University of Miami | Miller School of Medicine<br>P.O.
