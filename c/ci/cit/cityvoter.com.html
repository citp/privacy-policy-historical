<h2>CityVoter Privacy policy</h2>

<p><strong>The effective date of this Agreement is November 9, 2007.</strong></p>

<p>CityVoter is an online platform that helps people find local products and
services by slicing through all the ratings and reviews on the Internet to tell
consumers which businesses are the most popular. Part of our service includes
soliciting and aggregating votes and user comments/reviews. Our users ask
questions, invite friends, and write reviews about local businesses. These
reviews are posted to the CityVoter Site. Voting results and comments can then
be accessed and read by other CityVoter users. For the purposes of this Privacy
Policy, a "user" is defined as someone using the CityVoter Site, and
a "friend" is defined as someone you have explicitly invited to share
questions or local information with you.</p>

<p>By using CityVoter, you permit the collection and use of your personal
information as outlined below in our Privacy Policy. You should visit this page
periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Policy. </p>

<h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>

<p>CityVoter collects user submitted account information such as name and email
address to identify you and send you notifications related to the use of the
service. CityVoter also collects user submitted location information such as
city, state or zip. CityVoter also collects user submitted photos, reviews, and
ratings of local businesses. </p>

<p>Some information collected is not explicitly submitted by the user; we log
your browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring
URL, and timestamp. </p>

<h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>

<p>Information such as your screen name, profile photo and any personally
identifiable information you have included in your questions or comments may be
shown to friends or other users primarily in conjunction with services of the
CityVoter site. In addition, we may syndicate your questions or voting results
from your questions to third parties, in which case your screen name and any
personally identifiable information you have included in your questions or
comments may be shown to users of such third party web sites. </p>

<p>We may also use your email address to send you updates regarding our site,
but you may choose not to receive email of this type by managing the
subscriptions associated with your profile. Additionally, we use your email
address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends
you a personal message). </p>

<p>Browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL,
and timestamp data help us diagnose problems with our server, administer
CityVoter, and otherwise provide the highest possible level of service to you.
In addition, we use this information to perform statistical analyses of user
behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the
various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well
as the number of users that have been exposed to or clicked on, their
advertisements. </p>

<h3>3. Transfer of Information</h3>

<p>We may syndicate your questions or voting results from your contests to third
parties, in which case your screen name and any personally identifiable
information you have included in your questions or comments may be shown to
users of such third party web sites. </p>

<p>Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, rent, share,
trade or give away any of your personal information. CityVoter will disclose
information about individual users to governmental or judicial authorities or
law enforcement agencies, or to other individuals or entities in response to
subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes. Further, CityVoter may share
information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal
activities or suspected fraud, or to enforce or apply the terms and conditions
of this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p>We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a
transfer of ownership of CityVoter, such as an acquisition by or merger with
another company. In such an event, CityVoter will notify you before information
about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </p>

<p>CityVoter will notify you when information about you may be provided to
third parties in ways other than explained above, and you will have the option
to prevent such information sharing. </p>

<h3>4. Use of Cookies</h3>

<p>Like most websites, CityVoter requires cookies to function properly. Cookies
are small text files that reside on a user's computer and identify you as a
unique user. We use cookies to refine our site and simplify the user
experience. For example, the use of cookies allows registered users to enter
our site without explicitly typing in their email address and password every
time. You should be aware that CityVoter cannot control the use of cookies by
advertisers or any information advertisers may gather from their use of
cookies. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies,
there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept
the cookie feature; however, you should note that cookies may be necessary to
provide you certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information)
available on the CityVoter site. </p>

<h3>5. Controlling Your Personal Information</h3>

<p>As a registered CityVoter user, you can modify your personal information at
any time by accessing the "Profile" section of the site. CityVoter
will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally remove you and your
personal information from the site. If you wish to have your information
removed or your account terminated, you can contact CityVoter at <a href="mailto:privacy@cityvoter.com">privacy@cityvoter.com</a>. As with most
websites, it may be impossible to remove your account and comments without some
residual information being retained by CityVoter. </p>

<h3>6. Security</h3>

<p>Your CityVoter account is password-protected. CityVoter tries very hard to
protect our users' information. We use industry standard measures to protect
your information that is stored within our database. We limit the access to
your information to those employees who need access to perform their job function
such as our customer service personnel. If you have any questions about the
security at our website, please privacy@cityvoter.com. Although we take
appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of
information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that
we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this
Privacy Policy. </p>

<p><em>You hereby acknowledge that CityVoter is not responsible for any
intercepted information sent via the Internet, and you hereby release us from
any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted
information in any unauthorized manner. </em></p>

<h3>7. Children</h3>

<p>The CityVoter website is not directed to children. CityVoter does not
knowingly solicit information from any child under the age of 13. Should a
child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information to us, we will use
that information only to respond directly to that child (or a parent or
guardian) to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before
receiving his or her personal information.</p>

<h3>8. Third Party Links</h3>

<p>Our website may contain links to third party websites to which we have no
affiliation. CityVoter does not share your personal information with those
websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We suggest you
read the privacy polices on these third party websites. </p>

<h3>9. Terms and Modifications to this Privacy Statement</h3>

<p>By using the website, you signify your agreement to the terms of our Privacy
Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the site.
CityVoter may modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If a material change is
made to this Privacy Policy and/or the way we use our users' personally
identifiable information, then we will post a prominent notice of the nature of
such change on the first page of this Privacy Policy and also on our home page.
You are responsible for reviewing this Privacy Policy periodically to ensure
that you are aware of any changes to it. Your continued use of the site indicates
your assent to any changes to this Privacy Policy. </p>
