We do not collect personal information about you unless you specifically and knowingly provide such information to us. Instances where we may collect such information include:

  * where you have entered one of our contest promotions;
  * where you have subscribed to our newsletter; or

This username and password allows you to participate in certain online activities such as contests, promotions or online classified advertisements.

2\. How Your Personal Information Is Used by CHUM Limited  
Personal Information is only used by CHUM Limited for the purposes stated at the time of collection or as otherwise set out in this section.

If you have participated in an online activity, your personal information will only be used for the purposes of that online activity, unless you otherwise provide us with your consent. We may ask for your permission to use your personal information for other purposes, for example, to send you an email newsletter or for marketing purposes. We will only use this information for these purposes if you have provided us with consent by "opting-in" on the online form.

If you have entered and won one of our contests, your name, likeness and city of residence may be published by us and/or our sponsors. Please check with specific contest rules for details.

Non-personal aggregate information may also be extracted or compiled from the information we collect. Such information may be used to generate statistics and aggregate reports for internal use by CHUM Limited and its affiliates, subsidiaries, licensees, successors, assigns, suppliers and advertisers. In this instance, these statistics and reports will contain only aggregated and no personally identifiable information. Your identity is kept strictly anonymous. 

When you voluntarily disclose information on the bulletin boards or in the forum and chat areas of our web sites, your personal and other information disclosed in your communication shall become public information and can be collected and used by outside parties. Such activities are beyond the control of CHUM Limited.

3\. What "Cookies" Are and How They Are Used  
"Cookies" are simple text files that web browsers place on computer hard drives when sites are visited. Cookies cannot damage files, nor can they read information from a user's hard drive. The cookie, by itself, doesn't tell us your email address or who you are. When you participate in our activities, we do not store any personal information within cookies, nor do we link or combine information collected through cookies to any personal information submitted online. CHUM Limited uses cookies to help us measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics relating to use of our sites. As a convenience for users, CHUM Limited also uses cookies to remember non-personally identifiable user-names so that the need for multiple log-ins is eliminated. 

Please note certain features on our sites may not function if you do not accept cookies.

Log data collected on web servers supplies CHUM Limited with aggregate information about the number of visits to different pages on our site. CHUM Limited uses such aggregate information to improve access to content based on visitors' browsers and operating system types to make our content available to as many visitors as possible. We do not link the log data collected to any personal information submitted online.

4\. With Whom Your Information Is Shared  
In some instances, we use outside parties to administer contests, promotions and other online activities on our behalf. This may involve the collection of personal information. In such cases, we ensure that the way in which any outside party collects and retains personal information conforms to our privacy regime.

There may also be instances in which we are required by law to provide personal information without your consent. Such instances include emergency situations, or where required by governmental or other legal order.

Other than as indicated above, we will not sell, rent, share or otherwise make available your personal information to any outside parties without your consent. In such a case, we will tell you for what purpose such information will be disclosed and we will ask for your consent to "opt-in". If you want to share your personal information, you will have to respond affirmatively. If you do not respond, by default, we will assume that you do not want to be involved and your information will not be sold, rented, shared with or otherwise made available to outside parties.

We will not knowingly collect or retain any personal information of visitors to our websites who are under the age of 13, unless we obtain parental or legal guardian consent. Such information will never be sold, rented, shared or otherwise made available to outside parties without parental or legal guardian consent unless we are required to do so by court, governmental or other legal order.
