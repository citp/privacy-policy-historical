# Privacy Policy – Citizen Matters

Citizen Matters collects identifying information about individuals only when individuals voluntarily provide such information. We use personal information collected from you with information recorded by the server when you visit the citizenmatters.in website (like the URL, IP address, browser type and language, and the date and time of your request) to provide a better user experience, including customising content for you.

citizenmatters.in uses cookies and other technologies for better online experience, or in situations that require session data or require user verification.

User’s full name and personal website or blog URL (if provided) is the only identifying information that is displayed on the website about a user when user posts a comment or contributes stories. An email address of the user will be displayed if the user so permits.

Oorvani will not sell or make available such information to unrelated third parties.

We will occasionally analyse such information and we may share the results of such analyses with advertisers and other third parties. And under any circumstance, citizenmatters.in will refer only to general, aggregate usage data from these analyses – never specific identifying information.

Oorvani may change the policy anytime by posting changes online.
