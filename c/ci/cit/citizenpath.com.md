# Privacy Policy - CitizenPath

We use information we collect from the Online Services to communicate with you, process your orders, facilitate your transactions with our third-party marketing partners, and inform you of offers and discounts. For example, you may receive a welcome email that confirms your username and password, and later receive communications responding to your inquiries, providing services you request, and managing your account. We occasionally send service-related announcements, for example, to alert you if we need to temporarily suspend the Site for maintenance.

**Opting Out**. We send promotional emails and newsletters from time to time to users who have registered on the site and to those who have opted in to receive such emails. Generally, you may not opt-out of service-related or transactional communications, which are not promotional. If you do not wish to receive service-related communications, you may terminate your account by contacting Customer Care at [support@citizenpath.com](mailto:support@citizenpath.com) or (888) 777-9102. However, you can opt-out of promotional communications by following the unsubscribe instructions in any communication or by emailing us at [support@citizenpath.com](mailto:support@citizenpath.com).

You may choose not to provide CitizenPath with Personally Identifiable Information or you may turn off cookies in your browser by changing its settings. If you make these decisions, you may continue to use the Online Services and browse its pages. However, CitizenPath cannot process orders without Personally Identifiable Information.

**Surveys, Sweepstakes, and Contests**. We may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site, to measure customer satisfaction. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys, sweepstakes, or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes name, email address, and mailing address.

**We share customer information with third parties only as follows:**

**Order Processing**. CitizenPath, sometimes with the assistance of a third party or CitizenPath subsidiary, may use your Personally Identifiable Information to process your payment through merchant account services, and to generate the products and services you order. Your Contact Data may be used to follow up with you on transactions you initiate through Online Services, respond to inquiries made through Online Services, inform you of changes to Online Services, and send you additional information about CitizenPath and its products and services.

**Third Party Marketing**. Unless specifically authorized by you, we do not provide Personally Identifiable Information to third parties for marketing purposes. If you express interest in a third party offer or purchase a package that includes a third party offer, we may provide your Personally Identifiable Information to that third party solely in connection with the offer you have selected.

**Required by Law**. We may also disclose your personal information: as required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a legal request.

**Visitor Demographics**. Contact Data and Traffic Data are used to gather general statistics about our customers and visitors. We may use Demographic Data to generate collective information about our users, but not in a way that identifies any user specifically. For example, we may inform third parties about the number of registered users and unique visitors, and the pages most frequently browsed.

**Service Providers**. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with companies that provide support services to us or help us market our products and services. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose.

**Knowledge Base and Forums**. The Site includes a publically accessible knowledge base. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. You should use caution when deciding whether to disclose your personal information in these areas of the site. To request removal of your personal information from our community forums, contact us at [support@citizenpath.com](mailto:support@citizenpath.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

**Other Transfers**. We may share Personally Identifiable Information and other data with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with CitizenPath. If CitizenPath is merged, acquired, or sold, or if some or all of our assets or equity are transferred, we may disclose or transfer Personally Identifiable Information and other data in connection with the associated transactions

**Bankruptcy**. In the event of a CitizenPath bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used. If such an event occurs, your Personally Identifiable Information may be treated like any other CitizenPath asset and sold, transferred, or shared with third parties, or used in ways not contemplated or permitted under this Privacy Policy, without notice to you or your consent.

**Links**

**Third-Party Websites**. CitizenPath may maintain links to other websites and other websites may maintain links to the Online Services. This Privacy Policy applies only to CitizenPath.com and not to other websites accessible from CitizenPath or that you use to access CitizenPath, each of which may have privacy policies materially different from this Privacy Policy. If you visit other websites, CitizenPath is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites. It is your responsibility to review the privacy policies of non-CitizenPath websites to confirm that you understand and agree with them.

**Social Media Widgets**. Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button and widgets, such as the “Share this” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

**Data Retention**

**Data Retention**. At minimum, we will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you services, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. CitizenPath may maintain some or all of this data in its archives even after it has been removed from the Site, unless, under applicable law, you direct us to permanently erase your information.
