            <h1>City Link Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>We believe it is important to clearly state City Link's Privacy Policy.
              For this reason we have used plain english (with a minimum of "jargon"-
              IT or legal). If you require clarification of any of these points then please
              email <a href="mailto:webmaster@city-link.co.uk">webmaster@city-link.co.uk</a>
              . </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Our Privacy Principles are:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>We do not sell, rent or give your information to third parties.</li>
              <li>We will ask for specific permission from you before sharing any of your
                details with other Rentokil Initial Group companies. If you do agree to such
                information being shared we will ensure in advance that the other Group Companies
                involved have adopted a Privacy Policy at least as stringent as ours.</li>
              <li>We let you select how you may be contacted by us when you give us your contact
                details </li>
              <li>We give you the "<a href="#ssl">option of using SSL secure encryption</a>"
                technology to protect all the data you send or receive to our website.</li>
              <li> We clearly explain how and why we use "<a href="#cookies">cookies</a>"
                - but also why they contain no personal information.</li>
              <li>Whenever this policy changes we undertake to give advance notice to all
                users via our website. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions about our Privacy Policy</h2>
            <h2><a name="cookies"></a>Cookies </h2>
            <h3>So what are They?</h3>
            <p> Cookies are small pieces of information "remembered" by your web
              browser. We use standard "session cookies" in our site solely to store a "session id"
              for your visit to our web site. A session ID contains no personal information
              at all and is just a value would be something like: sfbeb2a41f49fdb8b001ed9416e45b733.
              The image below shows the a sample of our cookie contents.</p>
            <p><img src="cookie.gif" width="405" height="435" alt="Cookie data example"></p>
            <h3>So why do City Link use Cookies?</h3>
            <p>Because of the way the World Wide Web "protocol" works if we didn't
              do this the server would think you are were a different visitor every time you asked
              for a page from our site. This would make some elements of the site - particularly
              job booking impossible to use.</p>
            <p>It would be especially annoying to many of our customers who stay logged in
              throughout the day just so they can check the status of a job whenever they
              want.</p>
            <p>The session ID also allows us to monitor which areas of the site are most popular
              with our customers.</p>
            <h3>Why should you be Concerned? (or even remotely Interested?)</h3>
            <p>The reason is simply that a cookie is a file just like all the others on your
              hard disk. If it contained personal information then it could theoretically
              be read by someone else if they could gain access to your computer. It is because
              of this risk that all web browsers give you the option to"Turn Off"
              cookies altogether or at least prompt before accepting a cookie from a site.
            </p>
            <p>Whether you accept, reject or prompt before accepting cookies is a choice for
              you and you Organisation. City Link makes no recommendation about the
              settings you should use. We merely state that the cookie we send to your browser
              contains no personal information.</p>
            <h3>What happens if the City Link Cookie is Rejected?</h3>
            <p>If a cookie is rejected then our server will try to add the session ID to the
              address of each web page send to you. Unfortunately this may not be possible.
              Under those circumstances you would not be able to use our site.</p>
            <p>If this is the case your local branch would be happy to assist you by phone
              or fax.</p>
            <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
            <h2><a name="ssl"></a>Secure SSL Encryption</h2>
            <h3>What is SSL Encryption?</h3>
            <p>SSL Encryption is a public key encryption technology that encrypts all data
              sent to or from a website so that it cannot be read or changed by anyone else
              on the Internet. It is the established standard for high security transactions
              e.g. credit card payments via the Internet.</p>
            <h3>Does that mean it is unsafe to access sites without SSL?</h3>
            <p>This is a question which only you and your organisation can answer. There are
              some companies and organisations who would use encryption for all their data
              sent across the Internet and some who would use it very rarely (although most
              people would agree that credit card data should always be encrypted).</p>
            <p>Accessing a normal website is no more risky (and in some ways safer) than sending
              information by Internet email.</p>
            <h3>So why is SSL only an option on the City Link Site?</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately there is no such thing as a free lunch and the trade off for
              having such a very heavily encrypted data exchange is performance. </p>
            <p>Your computer has to encrypt all data before sending it. The server then decrypts
              it, processes the request, encrypts the reply and sends it back to you. Your
              browser then decrypts the reply and displays it to you. Depending on the speed
              of your computer the delay may be "quite noticeable".</p>
            <p>By giving you the choice at logon time to use SSL or the unencrypted site we
              are allowing you to choose the option which best meets your needs and security
              policy of your business.</p>
            <p>Whichever option you choose your password is always encrypted before it is sent.</p>
