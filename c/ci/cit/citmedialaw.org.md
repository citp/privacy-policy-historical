# Privacy Notice | Citizen Media Law Project

The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for the Citizen Media Law Project's (CMLP) website. We reserve the right to modify the information contained herein at anytime without prior notice. If we do make changes to our privacy policies, we will modify this page accordingly. Check this page periodically for amendments. This site and all information and materials on it are provided to you "as is" without warranty of any kind.

YOUR USE OF THIS SITE, OR YOUR PROVISION TO US OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION CONSTITUTES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS AND ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO THESE TERMS; DO NOT USE THE SITE OR PROVIDE INFORMATION IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THE TERMS.

**Normal Browsing**

As with many websites, we collect certain information, even when you are not logged in. When you browse, read, or download information from the CMLP, data is collected by the CMLP, including but not limited to your IP address, URL request, browser type, and date and time of your request. 

We analyze traffic to the CMLP site in various ways, including using a service called Google Analytics. (Google Analytics is subject to the privacy policy of Google, Inc., which you can find on their website.) We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of the site to our visitors. Unless you affirmatively provide additional information to us, we do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as name, mailing address, email address, phone number, or social security number.

We collect the IP addresses of visitors, time of access, browser type, and web pages visited. We collect this information on an aggregate basis only. For example, we track which pages are most popular among visitors as a whole. We do not track information on which pages an individual user visits. We do not collect any other information without your knowledge and permission.

Information You Provide**

CMLP requests personally identifiable information when you register for an account. Information may be used or requested to perform research, improve usability of the site, administer mailing lists or online communities, or other activities related to the CMLP services. This information may include, but is not limited to, personal names, e-mail addresses, location, and occupation.

**Disclosure of Information**

Available log records, account information, and all data stored on our servers may be accessed by our system administrators. In the event that we are required by law (including a court order) to disclose the information you submit, we will provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made so that you may object to the disclosure. We will send this notice by email to the address you have given us. We prefer to independently object to over-broad requests for access to information about users of our site, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this in all cases. If you do not challenge the disclosure request yourself, we may be legally required to turn over your information. 

**Cookies**

We may use session cookies when you visit our website while your browser is open, or while you are logged into our site. To facilitate our registration and login functions, we may use cookies to recognize when you return to our website. If you do not logout of your account, these cookies allow us to keep track of your username and password so that you do not have to resubmit the information to log into your account. If others will be using your computer, you should log out of your account so that your logon information is cleared.

**Children's Privacy**

This website's content is intended for adults and we will not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under age 13 who you believe has submitted personal information to this site, please contact us immediately. 

**Posting**

Posting or updating content is a public action, and all content may be publicly visible. Identification of all contributed content may include, but is not limited to, display of your account name or IP address. All content may be retained for restorative, archival, or research purposes by the CMLP. Editing or deleting content may alter the displayed state of the content, but will not permanently delete the content from the website.

**Security**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. However, your confidential use of this site cannot be guaranteed by CMLP. CMLP shall not be responsible for any harm that you or any person may suffer as a result of a breach of confidentiality in respect to your use of this site or any information you transmitted to this site.
