    1. ###  Personal Information 

      1. #### With All Site Visitors and Registered Users

If you are a Care Seeker or a Care Provider, in order to increase your chances of finding a job or finding the care you need, we share with Site Visitors and Registered Users the information that is included in your job posting or profile, aside from your contact information, as well as the following registration information, which we may include in your job posting or profile: your first name, first initial of your last name, city, state, profile picture, and if you are a Care Provider, your gender and, unless you opt-out, your age. With certain exceptions, you choose how much detail you want to include in either your job posting or your profile; the more information you share, however, the better chance you have of finding either care or a job. We may also share on your profile or job posting any company reviews you have posted on our Site and whether you have connected to Care.com through Facebook. If you are a Care Provider and have elected to verify certain information with Care.com or to have a background check performed, we may also disclose that information in your profile in addition to any payment or payroll preferences you have indicated. 

If you post information in a Care.com online group forum, such as the Working Moms Group, that information may be viewed by any Site Visitor or Registered User who accesses the forum. 

We may display personal testimonials of Registered Users and other endorsements on our Site or in other marking materials. These testimonials or endorsements may include Non Personal Information such as the Registered User's first name, first initial of last name, town and state. With a Registered User's consent, we may include Personal Information such as their full name. 

      2. ####  With other Registered Users and corporate providers

In addition to the information that is provided to all visitors to Care.com, Care Provider reviews and references are made available to certain Registered Users. If you are a Care Provider, your phone number will be visible to certain Registered Users if you elect to share it in your profile. In addition, your approximate residential location (through Google map plotting) is made available to certain Registered Users unless you elect to keep that information confidential. 

If you are a Care Seeker or a Care Provider, you will appear in search result listings if you match the search criteria used by a Care Provider or Care Seeker, as applicable. Similarly, you may appear in emails sent to Care Providers or Care Seekers in your area. Care Seekers may opt-out of being included in Care Provider search results and in certain emails sent to Care Providers. In addition, if you are a Care Seeker and you view the profile of certain Care Providers, those Care Providers will be able to see that you have viewed their profiles unless you opt-out of that information sharing. 

If you are a Registered User, your Care.com online status may be made available to other Registered Users unless you elect to keep that information confidential.

If you connect to Care.com through Facebook, we may allow any of your Facebook friends who have connected to Care.com through Facebook to see that you are a Registered User. In addition, other Registered Users who have connected to Care.com through Facebook will be able to see if you are friends with any of their Facebook friends or if you share certain affinities or interests with them. 

If you register for our Karoo mobile application, other Registered Users of that application may search for you by name, email address or other information. If they do, your name and profile photo will appear in the search results list and the searcher may contact you through the application to request to join your network or invite you to join theirs. No other Personal Information on the application will be shared with the Registered User unless you expressly allow them into your Karoo network. However, all information you post to the Karoo application will be available to all members of your network, including your location when you post to the application if you have given us permission to access and collect your location information. 

If you fill out a form to request information from a specific corporate care provider, such as a specific day care or tutoring center, the contact information you submit on a form for the provider will be forwarded to that provider. Similarly, if you call a corporate care provider directly or click to a corporate care provider's site from the Care.com site, any information you provide over the phone or on the provider's site, you will be providing directly to the provider. In addition, if you contact Care.com via phone or other channels to obtain information about senior care or other care options for yourself or your loved ones, information you provide Care.com, including contact, health, financial and other information may be forwarded to entity care providers that may meet your stated needs and preferences so the care providers may evaluate your needs and preferences and contact you. If you provide information about someone other than yourself, you represent that you have authority to provide us the information and to authorize us to share the information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Once provided to an entity care provider, the information is subject to the privacy policies of the provider.

**If we terminate your registration for any reason, we reserve the right to send a notice of your termination to other Registered Users with whom we believe you have corresponded.**

Care.com has selected vendors who maintain high standards with respect to privacy and agree to use the Personal Information only to perform specific services on behalf of Care.com. 

      4. #### With listings in Google and other public search engines

In an effort to further facilitate the ability for Care Seekers or Care Providers to find a caregiver or job, selected information contained in Care Seeker job postings and Care Provider profiles, which may include photo, first name, first initial of last name, city, state, and job/provider description, may also be shared with third party search engines and other vendors who run classified advertising businesses, and thus may be listed in third party web site search results (e.g., Google), which would make that information available to the public and allow them to link to your Care.com posting. Registered Users can opt-out of this sharing by adjusting their [account settings](https://web.archive.org/account-preferences-p1016.html). If you post information in a Care.com online group forum, such as the Working Moms Group, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in third party search engine results and available to the public. 

      5. #### With Facebook if you connect to Care.com through Facebook

If you connect to Care.com through Facebook's API, you may elect to post certain of your activities on Care.com back to your Facebook account. You will be prompted to decide whether or not to share those Care.com activities back to your Facebook account. 

      6. #### With third parties to send you direct mail from other companies 

We may share certain of your Personal Information, such as your name, postal address and other information we know about you such as your age, presence of children and the type of care you are looking for to third parties in the business of facilitating communications, such as direct mail brokers, to enable them to send you postal mail advertisements from companies whose products we believe may be of interest to you. We do not share email addresses for this purpose, and we do not allow these third parties to provide your personal information directly to the companies whose products are being advertised. If you do not want to receive these advertisements and prefer that we do not share your information with these third party communication facilitators for that purpose, you may opt-out by adjusting your [account settings](https://web.archive.org/account-preferences-p1016.html). 

      7. ####  As required by law or for reasons of safety 

You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose information we've collected about you if required to do so by law or if we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable to comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure is required by applicable law), or to protect or defend Care.com's, or a third party's, rights or property. We may also reserve the right to disclose information we've collected about you for purposes of protecting the health and safety of our community and Registered Users, such as in the case of risk of harm or violence against any person (including you).

      8. #### With our affiliates 

You acknowledge and agree that to the maximum extent permitted by law we may disclose any of the information we've collected about you to any of our affiliates or subsidiaries, for the purposes of providing you with the Services, operating the Site, and our other commercial purposes. 

      9. #### With Your Consent

We also may share your Personal Information with a third party if you consent to the sharing. 

    2. ###  Background checks 

Care.com offers various background check services from consumer reporting agencies. If you order a preliminary, preferred or preferred + background check to be run on you in response to a request by a Care Seeker who is considering hiring you and the check comes back clean or with information that does not result in Care.com suspending or terminating your account, we will forward the check to the Care Seeker who requested it. The results of a preliminary, preferred or preferred + background check that results in Care.com suspending or terminating your account will not be shared with other users. If you authorize a premium background check to be run on you in response to a request by a Care Seeker who is considering hiring you, the results of the check will be shared directly with the Care Seeker. If you have requested a background check through Care.com, a statement may be included in your profile to confirm that you have completed that check. However, we will not share the check or results with any other Site Visitor or Registered User unless you specifically consent. The service provider who completes the background check may send the results to you by email or postal mail. **You acknowledge that sensitive material may be included in your background check, and that you are responsible for providing us and our service provider (if applicable) with correct mailing information.**

    3. ###  Non Personal Information 

This Privacy Policy does not limit our use or disclosure of any Non Personal Information, such as information passively collected from your computer via cookies, web beacons, or standard logging of website activity. If you do not wish to share this information with Care.com, then you should take steps to limit the passive collection of data about your activities on our site, for example, by changing your browser settings to disable cookies. We reserve the right to use and disclose such Non Personal Information, as well as any other Non Personal Information we collect, with our advertisers and other third parties at our discretion.

    4. ###  Business transactions 

In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred.

  6. ##  Changing or Removing your Personal Information and Closing your Account 

If the Personal Information you provided when you registered changes, you may update this information by logging into your account and accessing your [account settings](https://web.archive.org/account-preferences-p1016.html). If you would like to remove some of the Personal Information you have posted on the Site, such as information you posted in profiles and job postings, you may do so by editing or deleting that item in your My Profile & Setting area or your My Job area. To request removal of other Personal Information you have voluntarily posted on our Site, such as information you may have posted in online group forums, contact [careteam@care.com](mailto:careteam@care.com?subject=Request%20to%20remove%20information). In some cases, we may not be able to reasonably accommodate your request to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. 

If you no longer wish to participate in our Services you may close your account directly in the [account settings](https://web.archive.org/account-preferences-p1016.html) portion of your account.

If you close your Care.com account, we will remove your name and other Personal Information from our publicly viewable database. If you close your account, we have no obligation to retain your information, and may delete any or all of your account information without liability. However, we may retain information related to you if we believe it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, Non Personal Information, account recovery, auditing our records, enforcing our rights and obligations under our agreements or if required by law. Care.com may also retain and use your information if necessary to provide the Services to other Registered Users. For example, just as an email you may send to another person through an email service provider resides in that person's inbox even after you delete it from your sent files or close your account, emails you send to others through Care.com to other Users, as well as your contributions to Care.com groups, may remain visible to others after you have closed your account. Similarly, other information you have shared with others, or that others have copied, may also remain visible. Care.com disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the information. Care.com does not control when search engines update their search index or cache, which may contain certain job post, profile or other information that has since been removed from Care.com's Site.

  7. ##  Collection of Information from Children

    * Care.com uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer), the industry standard method for computers to communicate securely without risk of manipulation or recipient impersonation. We utilize SSL in the online registration process, in the login process, and in the account management section of the Site.
    * Care.com uses strong encryption technology to protect sensitive information. 
    * Care.com employs firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and system monitoring to protect against unauthorized access of our systems.
