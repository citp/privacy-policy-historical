This law aims to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms  of individuals are protected and in particular that their honour is not harmed  and that their privacy and that of their family is maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Information we collect  and how we use it:</strong> <br>
We offer a number of  services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any  personal information to us, such as citiservi Classifieds, SL. In order to provide  our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>Information you provide</strong> - When you sign up for an AdManager       account or any citiservi service that requires registration, we ask you for       personal information (such as your name, email address and an account       password). </li>
<li><strong>Cookies - </strong>citiservi websites use Google Analytics, an   analytical web tool, licensed from Google, Inc., a Delaware   company whose headquarters are at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View (California),   CA 94043, USA   (“Google”). Google Analytics sends “cookies” – small files containing a string of   characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. The   information generated by the cookies regarding your usage of the website   (including your IP address) is directly transmitted and archived by Google   on servers based in the United States of America. Google processes   this information, on our behalf, to enable us to track the usage of the   website by compiling reports on website activity and through the provision   of other services related to website activity and internet usage. Google   may transmit such information to third parties when required to do so by   law or when such third parties process the information on behalf of   Google. Google will not link your IP address with any other data that   Google has in its possession. Most browsers are initially set up to accept   cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to   indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Google features and   services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. By using citiservi websites you consent to   the processing of your personal data by Google as described and for the purposes   mentioned above. </li>

<li>Developing new services. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Personal  information</strong> <strong>choice</strong><br>
When you sign up for a  particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal  information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose  for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such  use. <br>
If we propose to use  personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy  and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you an effective way to  opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will  not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those  described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have  obtained your prior consent. </p>
<p>You can decline to submit  personal information to any of our services, in which case citiservi may not be  able to provide those services to you. </p>
<p><strong>Sharing  of Information</strong> <br>
citiservi only shares personal information with  individuals outside of citiservi if we have a good faith belief that access, use,  preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to: </p>
<ul>
<li>satisfy  any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental  request,</li>
<li>enforce  applicable Terms of Use,  including investigation of potential violations thereof </li>
<li>detect,  prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or</li>
<li>protect  against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of citiservi, its users or  the public as required or permitted by law. </li>

<p>We may share with third  parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the  number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many  users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify  you individually. <br>
Please contact us at the  address below for any additional questions about the management or use of  personal data. </p>
<p><strong>Securing  your information</strong> <br>
We take appropriate  security measures to protect against unauthorised access to or unauthorised alteration,  disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data  collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as  physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems  where we store personal data. </p>
<p>We restrict access to  personal information to citiservi employees, contractors and agents who need to  know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services.  These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject  to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to  meet these obligations. </p>
<p><strong>Accuracy  of Information</strong> <br>
citiservi processes personal  information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance  with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review  our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only  collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or  improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal  information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our  users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. </p>
<p><strong>Accessing  and updating personal information</strong> <br>
When you use citiservi  services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your  personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to  delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained  by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify  themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before  processing such requests. We may decline to process requests that are  unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical  effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical  (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or  for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information  access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing  so would require a disproportionate effort. Individuals who wish to access  their personal data or have it corrected or removed may do by sending a request o such effect in  writing to <em>Plataforma de Gestión Publicitaria Citiservi S.L., Data Protection Department, Office 601, Avda Altos Hornos de Vizcaya 33, Edificio Ilgner, 48902 Barakaldo (Bizkaia), Spain</em>.

<li>Contact address</li>
<li>A photocopy of a valid national identity card or passport of the individual concerned</li>
<li>A statement of the requested course of action i.e. access to, amendment of or removal of information. </li>
</ul>
