        <p><b>I. Your Privacy at CiteMan Network</b>
        </p><p>When registering you do not need to provide any information except 
          the bare minimum that we need for your account: a username, email and 
          a password. Unlike many other sites we will never sell the emails to 
          unscrupulous spammers. In fact, we won't sell emails or give them to 
          anyone regardless of their scruples unless we are ordered to by law 
          (in the extreme case that law enforcement formally requests this information 
          we will comply with the law). We collect no personal information about 
          you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide this information 
          to us. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve our commitment 
          to your privacy please don't hesitate to contact us, there is nothing 
          we know of that we can do to show more respect for your privacy but 
          if you think there is let us know.</p>
        <p><b>II. What We Collect and Store Automatically</b></p>
        <p>If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, 
          read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain 
          information about your visit automatically. This information does not 
          identify you personally. Rather, information is kept in the aggregate. 
          We automatically collect and store only the information about your visit. 
          We use the information we collect to understand the traffic to our site 
          (for example, it's important to know how much bandwidth the site uses 
          so that we can purchase more if needed, if the "hits" to our 
          site increase we need to pay more money for better hosting), and to 
          help us make our site more useful to visitors like you.</p>
        <p><b>III. If You Send Us E-mail</b></p>
        <p>You may choose to provide us with personal information, as in e-mail 
          with a comment or question. We use the information to improve our service 
          to you or to respond to your request. Except for authorized law enforcement 
          investigations, we do not share our e-mail with any other outside organizations.</p>
        <p><b>IV. Cookies</b></p>
        <p>A) <b>Visiting the site</b> - If all you do is visit and surf the site 
          no cookies are used.<br>
          B) <b>Logging in</b> - If you decide to use a cookie (this is done by 
          checking the box that logs you in automatically) to save you logging 
          in every time you visit CiteMan Network, we place a little text file called a 
          "cookie" on your hard drive. It sits in your web browser directory. 
          A cookie lets us store your profile information on your computer and 
          lets our web site retrieve it when you visit our site. No other web 
          site can use or view the cookie set by CiteMan Network. Cookies help us create 
          a speedy web experience by remembering your user name and email information, 
          so you don't have to re-type it when signing in. Cookies do not store 
          personal information and we do not use them to track your movements 
          through our site and you do not need cookies to use this site (you will 
          simply have to log in at every visit) it's your choice.<br>
          C) <b>Spell Check</b> - The spell check has the ability to learn from 
          you. That means that if a word is consistently marked as a misspelled 
          word (a member's name that is not in the dictionary for example) you 
          can click the button "learn" in the spell checker and this 
          word will be saved to a cookie so that it will not be marked as a misspelled 
          word in the future. If you do not use this feature the Spell Checker 
          does not use any cookies.<br>
          If at any time we add anything else that uses a cookie the privacy policy 
          will be updated. If you find a cookie from our site that you think does 
          not fall under one of those categories please contact us. <br>
          <br>
          <b>V. Posting to the site</b><br>
          If you post a message on the site it is stored in a database. The pages 
          then display information from the database so that others can read your 
          post on the forums. This is how any dynamic site works, the text has 
          to be stored somewhere so that it can be displayed.</p>
        <p><b>VI. Links to Other Sites</b></p>
        <p>Our website has links to partners and other sites. When you link to 
          another site, you are no longer on our site and are subject to the privacy 
          policy of the new site.</p>
        <p><b>VII. Restriction of Liability</b></p>
        <p>CiteMan Network makes no claims, promises or guarantees about the accuracy, 
          completeness, or adequacy of the contents of this website and expressly 
          disclaims liability for errors and omissions in the contents of this 
          website.</p>
        <p>No warranty of any kind, implied, expressed or statutory, including 
          but not limited to the warranties of non-infringement of third party
