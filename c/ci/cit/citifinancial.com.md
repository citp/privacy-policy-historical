We use cookies for administrative purposes and to enhance your online experience. For example, we may use cookies to track the number of users of the site or to enable us to present rotating information to you at our site.

Email Policy

** At CitiFinancial®, we are dedicated to protecting your privacy. On occasion, we will ask for your email address and want you to feel comfortable about giving it to us. The following Email Policy was developed to help you understand how we use email and what your choices are.   


**How We Use Email**

When you give us your email address, you are giving us permission to contact you via email. We may then send you emails on a variety of subjects, such as:

  * Confirmation of receipt of your loan application 
  * Updates on special deals and offers that might interest you. 
  * Opportunities to provide feedback or complete online surveys, so you can tell us what you think. 



**Your Choices**

We believe email is an exciting new channel that is fast becoming the way to stay in touch. We also believe you should be able to choose what kinds of information you receive. Thus, if you receive marketing or promotional material by email, you will always have the option to take your e-mail address off of the CitiFinancial list. If you do so, please note that you could continue to receive some marketing or promotional information until your request is processed.
