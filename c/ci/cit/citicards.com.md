We may disclose any of the above information that we collect to affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties as described below.

The term "personal information", as used in this notice, means information that identifies you personally.

Our affiliates include those doing business under the Citi name, such as Citi Cards, Citibank, CitiFinancial and CitiMortgage, as well as others.

**Nonaffiliated Third Parties to Whom We May Disclose Personal Information**  
Nonaffiliated third parties are those not part of the family of companies controlled by Citigroup.

We may disclose personal information about you to the following types of nonaffiliated third parties:

** Your Privacy Choices**  
This section describes your privacy choices. Please remember that we will continue to protect personal information about you regardless of your privacy choices.

**1\. What Information Do We Collect?**

We collect two types of online information: non-personal and personal.

**Non-Personal Information**

When you visit our site, we collect the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. In addition, we gather information such as what browser and which version of it you're using, the type of operating system you have, and which site you came from. This information helps us provide an online experience that matches your device.

When you browse our site or receive one of our emails, Citi and companies we work with, use cookies and/or pixel tags to collect information and store your online preferences. Cookies are widely used and most browsers are set up to accept them automatically. If you would prefer, you can choose to not accept cookies.

It's important to note that cookies and pixel tags do not capture any information that can personally identify you. The information they gather helps us improve your online experience and may include:

  * Your response to one of our emails
  * Time and duration of your visit to our site
  * Pages you viewed while on our site

We may also supplement the information we collect with information we receive from other companies. For example, we may use marketing segments developed by us or other companies to customize certain services to your local area and provide relevant Citi offers tailored to you.

**Personal Information**

In addition to the information described in the previous section, we may also gather personal information that you provide to us such as your name, address, phone number, and email. Collecting this personal information enables us to offer you online experiences that help you with your financial needs. For example, we collect personal information when you are:

  * Banking online
  * Applying for a new program or account

If you've enrolled in Citi services, such as online bill payment, we collect personal information about your transactions, and how you interact with third parties such as those you pay like a utility company or phone company. Collecting this information enables us to provide you these services. You can refer to the terms and conditions for your account or service to learn how your information is collected and used.

If we have personal information from you, or information that's publicly available from other sources, we may use it in combination with the information that Citi has collected online. We can use this information to better tailor and personalize our service and marketing communications with you, both online and offline.

The personal information you provide online is held by the Citi business that maintains your account or is processing your application for a new product or service. You can access and/or change information in connection with your account or application by logging on to your account online or telephoning customer service. 

Please see the Privacy Statement, which we provide to all our customers, for a comprehensive explanation of how we collect, use and share personal information and what you can do to limit the use and sharing of your information. 

**2\. How Do We Use the Information We Collect?**

Citi uses the information we collect about and from you to manage our business and to offer an enhanced, personalized online experience on our site and third-party websites.

The information we collect allows us to:

  * Recognize you when you return to our site so we can personalize your experience
  * Process applications and transactions
  * Respond to your requests
  * Provide you relevant product and service offers on our site and in other advertising

**3\. How Do We Use Information from Our Advertisements on Other Websites?**

Companies we work with place and track advertisements on third-party websites. 

Like most advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to customers. We place advertisements by developing and using our own marketing segments that may combine online and offline information about our current and prospective customers. In addition, we may use marketing segments provided by online publishers and network advertising companies.

Network advertising companies that provide these services have their own privacy policies and are not subject to our Online Privacy Statement. Many of these companies provide ways to avoid targeted advertising provided by, or thru, them.

**4\. Can You Control Your Information That's Collected and Used Online?**

It's important to note that the information we use about you helps us provide you with products, services and experiences that benefit you. You have the ability to control how your non-personal information is collected and used online.

**Cookies**

You can control whether to accept cookies or not. If you decide to not accept cookies, some features and services on our site may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your Citi account(s). In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.

If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can: 

  * Change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it
  * Set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies

**Targeted Advertising**

If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information. To do so please visit the [NAI Opt-Out Page](https://web.archive.org/us/cards/opt_out.htm). Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.

Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The [NAI Opt-Out Page](https://web.archive.org/us/cards/opt_out.htm) provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies. 

From time to time, we may change this Online Privacy Policy. The effective date of this policy, as stated below, indicates the last time this policy was revised or materially changed. Checking the effective date below allows you to determine whether there have been changes since the last time you reviewed the policy.
