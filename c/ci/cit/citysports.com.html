<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>When you place orders or access your account information, know that City Sports uses a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.</p>

<p><strong>Ordering from www.citysports.com</strong></p>

<p>We track customer traffic patterns and site usage, and collect the domain name of e-mail addresses of visitors to our site and aggregate (not personally identifiable) information on what pages visitors access.&nbsp; We use this information to monitor the use of the site and to improve its performance and usefulness. We also collect information you volunteer, such as survey responses, comments, purchasing and billing information, and your requests. When you order from City Sports, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, billing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable.</p>

<p><strong>Using Cookies</strong></p>

<p>"Cookies" are removable files stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser. We use cookies to enhance your shopping and browsing experience. The text in a cookie, by itself, only tells us that you have visited our site before. It does not store any personal information such as your name, e-mail address, street address, or phone number. Cookies are also used to maintain your shopping basket. All data contained in the shopping basked is kept on our server and not in the cookie your machine is assigned. If your computer has certain types of Virus Protection software, you may be prompted to accept cookies from www.citysports.com. It is safe to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Our Third Party Relationships</strong></p>

<p>We have established several relationships with third parties vendors to best serve our customers.</p>

<p><strong>Credit Card Processing:</strong> We use NPC Merchant Services to process credit card orders. We supply them with data for credit card authorization and fraud detection only and they are restricted from using the data for any other purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Web Site Evaluation:</strong> From time to time, we may engage certain third parties to observe, track and report on the behavior of the users of this Web Site in order to evaluate the performance and features of this Web Site. These third parties will only have access to information to the extent necessary and will be required to not use any personal information for any other purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Marketing and Promotions</strong>: From time to time, we may engage certain third parties to assist in the dissemination of marketing and promotional offers (i.e., emails) to those customers who have agreed to receive such offers. These third parties will only have access to information to the extent necessary and will be required to not use any personal information for any other purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Hosting:</strong> www.citysports.com is hosted by UniteU Connected Commerce, Inc. which maintains the servers and databases on which your information is stored. They make this information available to City Sports, and are restricted from using this data for any other purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Third Party Relationships</strong>: From time to time, we may engage other third parties to assist in providing marketing, order processing, fulfillment and shipping services. These third parties will only have access to information to the extent necessary and will be required to not use any personal information for any purpose other than providing such services.</p>

<p><strong>STORE LOCATOR</strong></p>

<p>Additionally, from time to time, we may share non-personal, non-individual statistical information with our marketing partners, advertisers or other third parties for research purposes. That is, we will not tell our marketing partners that you purchased a specific product, but we may tell them how many customers purchased that product.</p>

<p><strong>Opening a City Sports Account</strong></p>

<p>We require your name, billing address, shipping address, email address, and telephone number to open an account for you. We may also ask some additional optional questions to help us better serve you. Except as provided in this privacy policy, this account data is never shared with anyone in any way without your consent. (However, we will cooperate fully should a situation arise where we are required by law or requested by a law enforcement agency to provide information about a customer.)</p>

<p><strong>Correcting or Updating Account Information</strong></p>

<p>You may update or change information related to your account by updating your profile, accessible via the home page once you are logged in, or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:onlinecustomersupport@citysports.com">onlinecustomersupport@citysports.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Social Sharing Features</strong></p>

<p>These services may offer social sharing features or other integrated tools, which let you share actions you take on these services with other media, and vice versa. The use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these features.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Promotions/Opt-Out</strong></p>

<p>From time to time, we may contact you about sales, special offers and/or new site features if you agreed to be included in our email lists when you created an account with us. To customize the type of information you want to receive from us, you may sign on and select the specific information you wish to receive. To cancel receipt of our free emails, you can unclick the "I would like to receive emails about special promotions" box associated with your account. You can also respond to any promotional email we send you, placing "REMOVE" in your subject line to discontinue email service. You can also send an email to onlinecustomersupport@citysports.com or call us (646) 470-0233 and inform us that you want to unsubscribe to our email lists.</p>

<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>

<p>California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide this information if it permits California residents to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing. City Sports qualifies for this alternative option. To opt out of having your information shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes, please call Customer Service or email us at <a href="mailto:onlinecustomersupport@citysports.com">onlinecustomersupport@citysports.com</a>.</p>
