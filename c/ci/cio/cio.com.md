# CIO.COM Privacy Statement

   
|  The CIO.COM web site is maintained by CXO Media Inc., 492 Old Connecticut Path, PO Box 9208, Framingham, MA. 01701-9208. The editorial staff at CIO can be reached by their email addresses, which are provided on the [Editorial Staff Page](http://www.cio.com/CIO/editstaff.html). 

CXO Media has contracted with DoubleClick to serve all advertising on its Web sites and e-mail newsletters. When DoubleClick is serving ads, it recognizes certain types of non-personally identifiable information, such as a user's IP address, browser version or type, operating system, service provider, and time zone. DoubleClick also uses cookies to note the general content of the sites you visit over time in order to serve ads on this site and other sites. Furthermore, CIO.com uses so-called "web beacons" (also referred to as "clear gifs" or "pixel tags") provided by Doubleclick to help manage our on-line advertising. These web beacons allow Doubleclick to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this site. Although DoubleClick does share with CIO.com the non-personally identifiable information described above, such information is strictly in the aggregate. Any pages a user calls up on cio.com are not connected with personally identifiable information collected either at cio.com or elsewhere. For more details about the non-personally identifiable information DoubleClick collects and the opportunity to opt out of such data collection, please visit [www.doubleclick.net:8080/privacy_policy/](http://www.doubleclick.net:8080/privacy_policy/)

_CIO_ uses WebTrends Live to analyze traffic to this web site. WebTrends Live does not create individual profiles for visitors. Unlike some tracking services WebTrends Live does not have a database of individual profiles for each visitor. WebTrends Live only collects aggregate data. For more information about WebTrends Live privacy policy, please click [here](http://www.webtrendslive.com/privacy_policy.htm). 

All **E-mail** lists maintained by CXO Media contain the names of people who requested to receive information from us. CIO may use such information for marketing and promotional purposes and may share the information with companies that it has pre-screened. Individuals always have the ability to stop their information being used for such purposes by sending an e-mail request to [kmarston@cxo.com](mailto:kmarston@cxo.com). 

CXO Media does not make available e-mail addresses obtained from the CIO Wanted email service, the discussion Forum registrations, nor the email an article to a colleague service. 

A user's personally identifying information will not be transferred to any other party unless otherwise stated at the time of collection. While CXO Media, Inc. will seek to require third parties with whom it has agreements to follow appropriate privacy policies, we do not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of such third parties. 

CIO.COM users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the CIO Discussion Areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties. 

Questions about this policy can be sent to us at [thorgan@cio.com.](mailto:thorgan@cio.com)
