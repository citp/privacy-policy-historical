**_Cinemark Privacy Policy_**

Privacy Policy Effective August 26, 2019

Personal information provided to us at cinemark.com and Cinemark mobile app prior to the Effective Date is governed by our previous policy.

Privacy and Security

At cinemark.com and Cinemark mobile app, our policy is to protect the confidentiality of the individually identifiable information that you provide. The information we collect from you is used to process your orders and to provide you with a more personalized, quick, convenient shopping and rewards experience.

What kinds of information do we collect and how do we use it?

To process your ticket purchase and to notify you of your order status, we need to know your full name, e-mail address, credit card number and expiration date and, to the extent permitted by law, ZIP code. Your street address and telephone number may be required when necessary for shipping and delivery of your order of movie tickets, gift cards, Supersavers discounts, rewards, and/or merchandise.  In addition, if you choose to complete certain forms, provide us with optional information, or send us requests, you may be asked to provide the following information: street (mailing) address, city, state, ZIP, mobile phone number, and/or birthday (but not year). We use your orders to make your future shopping experience more convenient and to determine your preferences for purposes of making recommendations and to determine your rewards from third parties that might be of interest or of value to you. We may also collect information through cookies and automated computer information, as described below.

If you elect to register as a patron, we will require your name, e-mail address, street (mailing) address, city, state, ZIP, and mobile phone number.  As a registered patron, we will use this information for our general marketing purposes, but we will NOT call your mobile phone for marketing purposes.  As a registered patron, you will also receive our marketing materials via the street and/or e-mail addresses you provide, although you can unsubscribe (opt out) of those mailings at any time.  Please note that it may take up to ten (10) business days after we receive your opt-out for it to take effect.  If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you e-mails about your account or any services you have requested or received from us.

If you agree to this Privacy Policy, we may use the personally identifiable information you disclose for Cinemark’s marketing purposes, including selling that information to third parties for their marketing purposes.  **_For Nevada residents_** , you may opt out at any time from the sale of your information to third parties by submitting a verified request to us at [cinemark.com/my-personal-information](https://web.archive.org/my-personal-information) directing us that we do not sell to third parties any of your information that we have collected or will collect about you.  The effect of your opt-out will be to prevent us from selling your information to third parties in exchange for financial consideration.  Your opt-out will NOT affect the information we collect about you or use for Cinemark’s own purposes.

You can review and change the individually identifiable personal information you provide to us at any time by clicking on My Profile. We are also constantly seeking to improve the layout and operation of cinemark.com based on the areas people visit, enjoy, and use most. We may occasionally wish to notify you about important changes to cinemark.com, new services, and special offers we think you might find valuable.

Information we collect also includes the IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for any computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device (any of which are referred to herein as a “Device”) used to access cinemark.com and use the Cinemark mobile app.  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.  Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access cinemark.com and use the Cinemark mobile app.  We may use Device Identifier information for a variety of purposes, including enhancing or otherwise improving cinemark.com and the Cinemark mobile app and our products and services. Device Identifier information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as personal information. 

We may supplement the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services, or goods you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, and to tailor our content to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through cinemark.com and Cinemark mobile app. In those cases, we will apply this privacy policy to the combined information.

How does cinemark.com protect the information we collect?

When you place orders, the information is sent via an encrypted connection designed to protect the information you send to us so that it is scrambled as it travels over the Internet. Once your information arrives safely at cinemark.com and Cinemark mobile app, it is encrypted in storage. Our policy is to limit access to that information only to those with a need to know. However, keep in mind that there is no such thing as perfect security.
