**Privacy and Security**

At cinemark.com and Cinemark mobile app, our policy is to protect the confidentiality of the individually identifiable information that you provide. The information we collect from you is used to process your orders and to provide you with a more personalized, quick, convenient shopping and rewards experience.

**What kinds of information do we collect and how do we use it?**

To process your ticket purchase and to notify you of your order status, we need to know your full name, e-mail address, credit card number and expiration date. We will ask you only for information needed to complete the credit or debit card transaction; provided, however, your street address and telephone number may be required when necessary for shipping and delivery of your order of movie tickets, gift cards, Supersavers discounts, rewards, and/or merchandise. In addition, if you choose to complete certain forms, provide us with optional information, or send us requests, you may be asked to provide the following information: street (mailing) address, city, state, ZIP, mobile phone number, and/or birthday (but not year). We use your orders to make your future shopping experience more convenient and to determine your preferences for purposes of making recommendations and to determine your rewards from third parties that might be of interest or of value to you. We may also collect information through cookies and automated computer information, as described below.

If you elect to register as a patron, we will require your name, e-mail address, street (mailing) address, city, state, ZIP, and mobile phone number. As a registered patron, we will use this information for our general marketing purposes, but we will NOT call your mobile phone for marketing purposes. As a registered patron, you will also receive our marketing materials via the e-mail address you provide, although you can unsubscribe (opt out) of those e-mails at any time. Please note that it may take up to ten (10) business days after we receive your opt-out for it to take effect. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you e-mails about your account or any services you have requested or received from us.

You can review and change the individually identifiable personal information you provide to us at any time by clicking on My Profile. We are also constantly seeking to improve the layout and operation of cinemark.com based on the areas people visit, enjoy, and use most.
