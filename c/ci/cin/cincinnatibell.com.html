<h2>Customer Support: Policies : Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>**Effective August 2008**</h3>
<br><div>
Cincinnati Bell, Inc. and its subsidiary and affiliated entities (collectively, "Cincinnati Bell") knows how important personal privacy is to our customers.  Cincinnati Bell maintains strict privacy policies and uses industry-accepted technologies to safeguard such information.  
<br><br>
As part of our commitment to our customers, Cincinnati Bell has adopted the following comprehensive Privacy Policy.  This Policy applies to information we have collected about you in connection with the products and services we provide to you.  However, some of our services have specific privacy policies, such as Fuse, ZoomTown, and cable services.  In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and a service-specific Privacy Policy, the terms of the service-specific Privacy Policy will control.  
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of Use posted on our Website, sets forth the general rules, policies and procedures governing your use of our Website.  Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes those policies and procedures, as well as how we collect and use various types of information. We encourage you to read this Policy in its entirety.


<br><br>

<h3 class="blue">Information Collection </h3>
<p>The information we collect depends on what you do when you visit our web site. There are two types of information that we are likely to record: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>Non-personally identifiable information collected in the aggregate: </b> We collect various "anonymous" facts each time you visit our site. This information includes the date and time you access our site, the internet address you use, what page(s) on the site you visited, the type of browser you use, etc. We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. </li>
<li><b>Personally identifiable information you give us: </b> We collect the personally identifiable information you provide directly to us in the course of conducting business on our web site. This information can include name, e-mail address, credit card numbers, etc.  Except as otherwise provided below, this personally identifiable information is only used to conduct business with you, provide you with specific services and communicate with you. We may also use this information to send you e-mails about new products and services. If you create a personal account with us and provide us with the above information for the purpose of conducting business, you authorize us to store your name, shipping address, credit card and billing information.</li></ul>


<br>

<h3 class="blue">How We Use Your Information</h3>
<h4>Personally Identifiable Information.</h4>
<p>We may use your personally identifiable information for the following business purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>To ensure that you are receiving the services you ordered</li>
<li>To allow us to properly maintain those services and to make improvements or upgrades when necessary</li>
<li>To confirm that you are being properly billed</li>
<li>To provide you with technical support and for system maintenance</li>
<li>To inform you of new products or services that may be of interest to you</li>
<li>To us to understand the use of, and identify improvements to, our services</li>
<li>To prevent fraud, including the unauthorized use of our service or violations of applicable policies and terms of service</li>
<li>To ensure our own compliance with the law </li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, we may use or disclose personally identifiable information about you without your consent to protect our customers, employees, or property, in emergency situations, to enforce our rights under our terms of service and policies, in court or elsewhere.  Further, we may disclose your personally identifiable information where necessary to provide or conduct a legitimate business activity related to the services provided to you or as required as required by law or legal process.  </p>

<p>We do not sell, trade or rent your personally identifiable information to outside companies or marketing firms, except for the following circumstances. We may share this information within the family of Cincinnati Bell-affiliated companies to improve our services to you.  We may also share personally identifiable customer information with our agents and trusted business partners when required for the specific and limited purposes of providing products or services to you that you have authorized, such as to our shipper in order to fulfill an on-line order, as well as to evaluate and improve the quality of our services.</p>
