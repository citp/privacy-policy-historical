# Privacy Policy for Cinesouth.com

#### We are committed to your privacy.

At Cinesouth, we believe strongly in protecting our users' privacy. You may choose to provide personal information at other times, such as when you enter a contest or ask that information be sent to you from one of our advertisers. We do not disclose your personal information to third parties except under the limited circumstances described below, and by using our service, you agree that we may do so. 

When you choose to send a greeting, you must provide your name, your email address and the name and email address of the recipient. This information is used to customize the mail and notify both you and the recipient that the greeting has been sent. Because we are committed to protecting your privacy, Cinesouth  will not disclose this information to third parties except under the limited circumstances described below. You may receive email communications from us regarding our products and services. Each of these messages will provide information on how to unsubscribe from future emails. 

In addition, we will not disclose your personal information to a third party unless we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of Cinesouth; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our members or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false registration information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you -- including your computer's IP address -- may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions.)

Cinesouth does share non-personal, non-individual information in aggregate form with third parties for business purposes. For example, we may tell our business partners how many customers in certain demographic groups sent certain mails. 

#### Mail Information

The information you provide to us is used to customize your greeting with the recipient's name and with your message, and to deliver an email notification to the recipient. We treat the mails as private correspondence between the sender and the recipient and will not disclose the contents of a mails, other than to the intended recipient, unless we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of Cinesouth; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our members or the public. However, if you provide a false email address or attempt to pose as someone else when sending a mail, mail is subject to cancellation, and information about you -- including your computer's IP address -- be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions. Under normal circumstances, we will not monitor or edit the contents of the mails you send. On occasion, however, Cinesouth may need to view your message in connection with the technical processing of your greeting or the maintenance of our network. Also, if you ask one of our customer service representatives to help you send a card or to verify that a card was sent, that representative will be able to access all information about the card, including the recipient's email address and the message.
