# Cineversity - Cinema 4D Training and Tools

This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide to Maxon Computer, Inc. when you visit, or use our products or services located on Cineversity ([www.cineversity.com](http://www.cineversity.com/)), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing such information. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect: (i) through our Services, and (ii) in electronic messages between you and our Services.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other Maxon Computer, Inc. services or any information collected by us offline or via third-party sites that may be accessed through hyperlinks on our services.

By accessing or using our Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you have any concern about providing information to us or having such information used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy, you should not visit our website, apps or otherwise use our services. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS OR USE OUR SERVICES.

We collect several types of information about visitors and/or users of our services. We may collect this information either directly when you provide it to us or automatically as you navigate through Cineversity. This information includes:

  * We will collect and process your personal data when you register for and create an account, subscribe to a newsletter, submit feedback, enter a contest, fill out a survey, post in a forum, send us a communication, or otherwise engage with the website. 

  * When ordering products or services on Cineversity, you may also be asked to provide a credit card number and other payment-related information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is required to use the services (e.g. registering an account, subscribing to a premium membership, etc.) and some is voluntary. If you do not provide data when needed for a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.

  * We collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers and/or software, to administer our services, and to gather demographic information.

  * We may collect certain information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. Such information tells us about your equipment, browsing actions, and the resources that you access and use through the services, such as your operating system and browser type. We use analytics and similar services, to help us to deliver a better and more personalized service to users by enabling us to estimate and track usage patterns, customize our services according to your individual preferences, and speed up your searches.

  * When you use our services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use and the operating system version, so we know the best version of the application to provide you. We do not ask you for, access, or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while using our services.

  * When you contact us for customer support we may collect additional information to resolve your issue.

  * We are not a site targeted at children or those under the age of 13. If you are a school and you use a Cineversity service for children under the age of 13, or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, you are responsible for obtaining consent from the parents/legal guardians of each child you wish to allow to participate in using any of our services. A child using our services will be able to participate in certain limited activities (such as taking online educational and informational courses).

We cannot be held accountable for activity that results from your own neglect to safeguard the secrecy of your password and username.
