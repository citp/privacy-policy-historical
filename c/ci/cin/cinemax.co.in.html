                    <strong>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT </strong></font><br>
                    We ask our users to register when they use the cinemax.co.in 
                    site and services (collectively, the "Service"). 
                    Through our online registration process, we collect a variety 
                    of information about the user, which may include, among other 
                    things, name of the person registering, location, gender, 
                    phone number, email address, user name and password. cinemax.co.in 
                    may also request and collect other information from time to 
                    time. <br>
                    <br>
                    We automatically track information related to use of the Service. 
                    This information may include, among other things, URL tracking 
                    information, what browser the user is using, the user's IP 
                    address, pages and ads viewed by a user and selections or 
                    other actions taken on the Service. We may track usage through 
                    cookies. A cookie is a small data file written to a user's 
                    hard drive. Cookies may be used to, among other things, allow 
                    automated log-in and may contain information such as a Login 
                    ID or other information about preferences or Internet use. 
                    Third party advertisers that we work with may also place cookies 
                    on browsers of users of our Service. <br>
                    <br>
                    We also collect information about your movie preferences. 
                    For example, we may collect, among other things, information 
                    such as what movies you purchase tickets to or what theatres 
                    you attend. We may save information sent or posted to the 
                    Service. For example, we may save messages posted in our chat 
                    rooms or other message areas or feedback left for other users. 
                    We may collect correspondence, such as emails or letters, 
                    sent to us. We may collect user responses to online polls, 
                    ads, surveys, electronic newsletters and questionnaires. <br>
