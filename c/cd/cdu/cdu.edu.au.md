## Collection

The University collects the personal information that it needs to carry out its functions and activities, including its statutory functions.

The University may also collect statistical information to assist us and other government bodies to provide the most appropriate educational courses and facilities to students.

> 
> (c) using cookies on our website. A cookie is a piece of text sent from a web server to your computer, and is used to identify you only by a random number. This information does not personally identify you, but it does tell us that your computer has visited our site and what areas of the site have been browsed.
