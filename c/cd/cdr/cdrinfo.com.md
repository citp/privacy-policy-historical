##### Preserving our Users' Privacy

CdrInfo.com is poised into helping all our users preserve their own on-line privacy. We take any incident communicated to us very seriously and we investigate it thoroughly.

In any case, CdrInfo.com preserves the right to review by itself any non-open source advertisement code (non-javascript or non-html banners such as "rich media" like flash, shockwave, java, activeX, etc). In case an advertiser chooses not to conform with this peer reviewed, open code practice, CdrInfo.com can, at any time, terminate any related campaign, at no further advertiser notice, at the sole expenses of the offending advertiser and without any single refund!
