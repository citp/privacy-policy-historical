| 

If you don't agree to those changes (regardless of whether you email us), then unfortunately we must ask you to cease using our CD PROJEKT RED games and services. We're sorry we have to say that, but we hope you'll appreciate that for our services to work properly we need to have everyone using it under the same rules instead of different people having different rules. That's why we encourage you to get in contact if you have queries.
