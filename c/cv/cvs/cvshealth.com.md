In the event that CVS or some or all of our business, assets or stock are sold or transferred (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings) or used as security, or to the extent we engage in business negotiations with third parties, personal information may be transferred to or shared with third parties as part of any such transaction or negotiation.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may provide personal information to our affiliated businesses or to our business partners, who may use it to send you marketing and other communications.

#### Cookies and Other Technologies

Like many other websites and online services, we collect information about Website traffic and usage patterns through the use of cookies, Web server logs, and other, similar technologies. We use this information for various purposes, such as to ensure that the Website functions properly, to facilitate navigation, to personalize your experience, to understand use of the Website, to diagnose problems, to measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and to otherwise administer the Website.

Cookies are small computer files we transfer to your computer's hard drive. These small text files help us personalize content on our pages and provide programs like e-coupons. Your browser software can be set to reject or accept cookies. Instructions for resetting the browser are available in the Help section of most browsers.

Our use of cookies also allows us to collect and retain certain information about a website user, such as the type of Web browser used by our customer. Reviewing our Web server logs and our customers' use of our site helps us to, among other purposes, statistically monitor how many people are using our site and for what purpose.

Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider. An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Website, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels of the Website, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Website.

We may use Adobe Flash Local Stored Objects (“LSOs”) and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Website. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications.

#### Tracking/Third-Party Advertisers

We may use third-party advertising companies to display advertisements regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you when you access and use the Website, based on information relating to your access to and use of the Website and other online services. To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags). If you would like more information about this practice and to learn about your choices in connection with it, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> and <http://www.aboutads.info/>.

We do not respond to browser do-not-track signals.

We may use analytics providers that use cookies, pixel tags and other, similar technologies to collect information about your use of the Website and your use of other websites or online services.

#### Fraudulent Sites, Spam & Phishing

Please be aware that there may be fraudulent websites that illegally use CVS logos, and other aspects of the CVS brand. CVS is in no way associated with any fraudulent websites. These sites may circulate their presence on the internet via spam email, or through fraudulent phishing practices.

These sites have not been authorized by CVS to use our name and we work aggressively to identify their source and have them shut down. If you are in receipt of this type of spam email, to help protect your privacy you should avoid replying to it or forwarding it to other people.

In addition to our official websites, CVS works with a number of third parties that host websites and micro-sites that provide information and services to our customers. If you are concerned that a website or an email may be fraudulent, please contact us by phone at 888-607-4287 or email [privacy.officer@cvshealth.com](mailto:privacy.officer@cvshealth.com) with your concerns.

You can request the removal or modification of the personal information you have provided to us by sending an email to [privacy.officer@cvshealth.com](mailto:privacy.officer@cvshealth.com) For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the personal information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity and obtain information on the context in which you provided your personal information before implementing your request. We will try to accommodate your request as soon as reasonably practicable.

Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion. There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed.
