Our use of cookies also allows us to collect and receive certain information about a website user, such as the type of web browser used by our customer. Reviewing our web server logs and our customers’ use of our site helps us to, among other purposes, statistically monitor how many people are using our site and for what purpose.

We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels of the Website, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Website.

We may use Adobe Flash Local Stored Objects (“LSOs”) and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Website. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications.

#### Tracking/Third-Party Advertisers

We may use or partner third-party advertising companies, including social media companies like Facebook, as well as third-party advertising companies to provide measurements services and display targeted advertisements regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you when you access and use the Website; these targeted advertisements are based on information relating to your access to and use of the Website and of other online services. To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser, including through the use of pixel tags, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from the Website and elsewhere on the internet. We may use analytics providers that use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other, similar technologies to collect or receive information about your use of the Website and your use of other websites or online services.

You may opt out of the collection and use of information for advertisement targeting, at any time.

#### Fraudulent Sites, Spam & Phishing

Please be aware that there may be fraudulent websites that illegally use CVS logos, and other aspects of the CVS brand. CVS is in no way associated with any fraudulent websites. These sites may circulate their presence on the internet via spam email, or through fraudulent phishing practices.

These sites have not been authorized by CVS to use our name and we work aggressively to identify their source and have them shut down. If you are in receipt of this type of spam email, to help protect your privacy you should avoid replying to it or forwarding it to other people.

In addition to our official websites, CVS works with a number of third parties that host websites and micro-sites that provide information and services to our customers.
