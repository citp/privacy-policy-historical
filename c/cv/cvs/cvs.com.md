# CVS pharmacy

Effective Date: December 10, 2015

This Privacy Policy describes the practices of CVS Pharmacy, Inc. (“CVS,” “we” or “us”) in connection with information collected through CVS.com and other websites and mobile applications operated by us and from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Services”). By using the Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, or about the way your information is collected and used, please call us toll-free at (888) 607-4287.

**To the extent that information collected through the Services is patient information provided to obtain pharmacy services, this information is governed by the  
CVS/pharmacy** [Notice of Privacy Practices](http://www.cvshealth.com/patient-privacy) **and not this Privacy Policy**. If you have questions about which policy applies to information you have provided, please do not hesitate to [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/help/help_contact_us.jsp), or call us toll-free at (888) 607-4287

We may change this Privacy Policy. The “Effective Date” legend at the top of this page indicates when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Services. Your use of the Services following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy. 

In some circumstances, CVS Caremark's use of your information will also be subject to the requirements of the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (frequently referred to as 'HIPAA'). For example, when you are submitting information for prescription refills we are subject to the requirements of HIPAA. In those circumstances, the terms of CVS Caremark's HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices will apply. If you have questions about which policy applies to information you have submitted, please do not hesitate to [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/help/help_contact_us.jsp), or call us toll-free at (888) 607-4287. 

Any changes in our Privacy Policy will appear on this page so that you are aware of the data we collect and how we use it. If you register and provide us with a valid email address, we will notify you by email of any significant changes to this Privacy Policy. You will be given the opportunity to opt in to any significant new uses of personal information if that information was collected prior to the change in this policy. If you do not opt in to any significant new uses of your personal information, that information will continue to be governed by the policy in effect at the time your information was collected. If you do not register, we will not have your email address and cannot provide you with any notifications of Privacy Policy changes.

The Services may contain links to, or otherwise make available, third-party websites, services, or other resources not operated by us or on our behalf (“Third Party Services”).

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Services access information and password and for restricting access to your device, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your password.

  


## Cookies and Other Technologies

Like many other websites and online services, we collect information about Services traffic and usage patterns through the use of cookies, Web server logs, and other, similar technologies. We use this information for various purposes, such as to ensure that the Services function properly, to facilitate navigation, to personalize your experience, to understand use of the Services, to diagnose problems, to measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and to otherwise administer the Services.

Cookies are small computer files we transfer to your computer's hard drive. These small text files help us personalize content on our pages and provide programs like e-coupons. Your browser software can be set to reject or accept cookies. Instructions for resetting the browser are available in the Help section of most browsers.

Our use of cookies also allows us to collect and retain certain information about a website user, such as the type of Web browser used by our customer. Reviewing our Web server logs and our customers' use of our site helps us to, among other purposes, statistically monitor how many people are using our site and for what purpose.

Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider. An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels of the Services, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Services.

We may use Adobe Flash Local Stored Objects (“LSOs”) and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Services. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications.

  


## Tracking/Third-Party Advertisers

We may use third-party advertising companies to display advertisements regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you when you access and use the Services, based on information relating to your access to and use of the Services and other online services. To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags). If you would like more information about this practice and to learn about your choices in connection with it, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and http://www.aboutads.info/.

We do not respond to browser do-not-track signals.

We may use analytics providers that use cookies, pixel tags and other, similar technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and your use of other websites or online services.

  


## Physical Location

We and our service providers may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, WiFi signals, beacons, Bluetooth, and near field communication protocols, when you are in or near a CVS store. We may use your deviceâ€™s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content, including for marketing purposes. We may also use such information to understand traffic patterns in, near, and across our store locations. We may share aggregated statistics derived from the location and other information we collect with advertisers and other third parties. You may be permitted to allow or deny such collection of your deviceâ€™s location, such as through the settings on your mobile device and/or, to avoid the collection of location by beacons, by disabling Bluetooth. If you choose to deny such collection, we and our service providers may not be able to provide you with certain personalized services and content.

  


## Fraudulent Sites, Spam & Phishing

Please be aware that there may be fraudulent websites that illegally use CVS logos, and other aspects of the CVS brand. CVS is in no way associated with any fraudulent websites. These sites may circulate their presence on the internet via spam email, or through fraudulent phishing practices.

These sites have not been authorized by CVS to use our name and we work aggressively to identify their source and have them shut down. If you are in receipt of this type of spam email, to help protect your privacy you should avoid replying to it or forwarding it to other people.

In addition to our official websites, CVS works with a number of third parties that host websites and micro-sites that provide information and services to our customers. If you are concerned that a website or an email may be fraudulent, please contact us by phone at 888-607-4287 with your concerns.
