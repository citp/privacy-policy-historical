### CVSCaremark.com  Privacy Statement

####  Effective Date of Privacy Statement: May 9, 2008

CVS Caremark Corporation and its affiliated companies, ("CVS Caremark") appreciate your interest in this CVSCaremark.com (the Site). Your privacy is important and we want you to understand our practices with respect to gathering information from visitors to the Site and with respect to the uses we make of that information. Please check each portion or page of the Site that you visit. Certain portions or pages of the Site may contain changes to the Privacy Statement applicable to your use of that portion or page, for example, certain applications may request additional information from you. 

This Privacy Statement applies to the online collection of information on this Site and not to other parts of CVS Caremark. 

**Who May Use This Site**

This Site is designed for users from the United States. Users from other countries are advised not to disclose personal information unless they consent to having their information used as set forth in this Site's Privacy Statement rather than under the law of user's home country. You transmit data to servers located in New York and Rhode Island subject to United States and New York law. You should not send any personal information to this Site unless you agree to be bound by this Privacy Statement and by United States and New York law. 

**Information and Uses**

When someone visits the Site, our web servers automatically gather information that allows the Site to communicate with the visitor's computer during the visit. We also track such information as the number of visits to the Site, which parts of the Site visitors select, IP address (the Internet address assigned to your computer from your Internet Service Provider), domain type, browser type (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), date and time of day. We use those types of information for statistical purposes that help us design and administer the Site. Those types of information do not disclose Personal Information that would permit us to identify or locate individual visitors. 

Privacy concerns focus on Personal Information, that is, information that could identify a specific individual such as your first/middle initial or name and last name, street address, town or city, state, ZIP code, telephone number, email address, credit card, social security number, gender and any other information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you. If during your visit you complete a comment form, enter a contest, or submit other information to us, you may provide us with Personal Information. We may collect and use that Personal Information to respond to your specific requests, provide you with offers of products or services, to market products and services which we think may be of interest to you, or to communicate with you for other business purposes. 

We do not sell, rent or give your personal information to any non-affiliated third parties, except as described in this Statement. We may transfer your personal information to companies that perform services on our behalf. We notify businesses to which we transfer your personal information that the information was shared with us under this Privacy Statement.  If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used for further contact, we will remove you from our distribution list. 

We may link information collected from you through various means, including information collected automatically and through the use of cookies and Registered User information, with information we learn in our stores and from Registered Users. Our goal is to help offer you content, advertisements, products, and services that are most likely to appeal to you. 

As explained in the Opt Out/Modify Information section, we will make a reasonable effort to remove your Personal Information from the Site in such a way that you will not receive future communications from us. If you notify us that Personal Information previously submitted to our Site is no longer accurate, we will make a reasonable effort to make appropriate corrections.  To facilitate our efforts, it would be helpful if you could let us know the context in which you provided Personal Information, e.g in connection with promotion of a specific product or service. 

**Information Placed on Your Computer**

We may store some information (commonly known as a "cookie") on your computer when you look at or use the Site. This information facilitates customizing your use of the Site and ensures that you do not need to re-enter your details every time you visit us. You can erase or block this information from your computer if you want to. (Your 'help' screen or user manual should tell you how to do this.) This cookie will enable us to serve new graphic content to you, based on which content you saw on your last visit to the site. There are certain features which you may not be able to access if your disable cookies. 

**Access to Your Information**

In the event that CVS Caremark or some of our assets are sold or transferred or used as security or to the extent we engage in business negotiations with our business partners, the information collected on this Site may be transferred or shared with third parties as part of that transaction or negotiation. We may also provide information or provide access to information to any of our affiliated businesses or to our business partners or fulfillment houses. 

If we are requested by law enforcement officials or judicial authorities to provide information on individuals, we may, without your consent, provide such information. In matters involving claims of personal or public safety or in litigation where the data is pertinent, we may use or disclose personal information without your consent or court process. 

We may use information you submit to investigate security breaches or otherwise cooperate with authorities pursuant to a legal matter. We may also remove personally identifiable information and use remaining data for historical, statistical or business planning purposes. 

**Will Your Information be Secure?**

We will take reasonable measures which we believe are appropriate to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction, and, where possible, will ask that any third parties to whom we may transfer your information take comparable steps to protect that security. We are the owner of data you supply to us. 

**Our Privacy Statement and Outside Links**

Our Privacy Statement only applies to this Site. Our Site contains links to sites outside our control. Please be aware that these sites may collect information about you and operate according to their own privacy practices which may differ from our Privacy Statement. Remember to consult that site's own Privacy Statement, as once you leave this Site, any information you submit is not in our control. 

**Opt Out/Modify Information**

You can request the removal or modification of your Personal Information by sending an e-mail to the appropriate area under "Contact Us".  We will then make a reasonable effort to accommodate your request. As previously noted, it would be helpful to let us know the context in which you provided Personal Information. 

**Conditions of Use, Notices and Revisions**

If you choose to visit our Site, your visit and any disputes over privacy are subject to this Privacy Statement and to our general Terms of Use, including any limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes and application of law provisions. We reserve the right to change this Statement at any time without notice except as otherwise provided here.
