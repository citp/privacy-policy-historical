# CVonly.com - Smart Recruitment Solutions - Privacy Policy

The following explains our information gathering and distribution practices for the CVonly.com job site.

For Job Seekers, we regard your CV as a very personal document and we wish you to have full control over who can view it and whether or not you wish to have your contact details (name, address, telephone number, email address etc) visible to Employers.

We give you the option of putting your CV in our searchable database which is a significant aid to quickly finding employment. We provide you a choice in how you do this. The choice allows you to select the level of confidentiality that you believe is appropriate, resulting in hidden contact details.

The level of control is provided to you by your choice of whether to make your CV searchable by Employers or not. Making your CV searchable considerably increases your exposure to potential employers. To prevent your CV from being searched and viewed by Employers, you can choose to keep your CV inactive thus unsearchable. Choosing to do so means that your CV is not accessible by Employers when they search the Data Base of CVs but you can gain access to it and use it when applying for job advertisements.

We use our best efforts to limit access to our CV services to recruiters and employers who agree to abide by our terms and conditions. If any recruiter is found to be breaching these terms and conditions, then we will immediately terminate their use of our services.

You may remove your CV from our searchable database at any time by contacting us through the Job Seekers home. However, recruiters who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your CV in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of your CV by recruiters in these instances.

Electronic Jobs Finder   
The Electronic Jobs Finder matches job seekers requirements for employment with the profile of vacancies advertised on CVonly.com. For job seekers who subscribe to this service you receive an email listing those jobs that we believe you may be interested in. 

Application Forms  
When you apply for positions with some of our Clients, you will be requested to complete an application form. The information submitted by you on the application form will be used by our Clients to assess your suitability for the position to which it applies. We are not responsible for framing the questions in our Client's application forms, and merely provide the electronic means to enable our Client to present the application form to you, and to collect the application form once it has been completed by you. We do not process any of the data in completed forms, which we present to our Clients in our applicants' database. We may, however, temporarily store your completed forms.

You expressly agree, acknowledge and accept that we provide this service as a medium for the applications forms. Whilst we will use our best endeavors to use suitable protection methods, please note that we do not guarantee that our protection methods will ensure that your completed application form will be received by us or by any potential recruiter. We also cannot guarantee that the application form does not include:

false, inaccurate or misleading information;   
material that infringes third party's Intellectual Property Rights;   
defamatory, libelous or otherwise unlawful information;   
information that violate any law, statute, regulation or order (including, without limitation, those concerning consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination or the advertising prohibited goods or services); or   
Any virus, worm, Trojan horse, time bomb, or other code that contains contaminating or destructive properties.   
Consequently, we cannot accept any liability for any direct or indirect damages (including, without limitation, loss of profits, loss of contracts), or any consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or any other monetary or other damages or liabilities arising out of or relating to your use of the application form. In addition, we reserve the right to remove your completed application form and suspend our services in relation to it if we consider in our absolute discretion that providing the service may incur a legal liability for you, our Clients, or us.

If you have any concerns over any application form, please contact us for advice. Our contact details are set out below.
