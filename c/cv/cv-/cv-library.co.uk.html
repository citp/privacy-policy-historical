	<h1 class="cvlH1Vag">CV-Library Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p class="cvlSmall">CV-Library endeavours to ensure that the information that you submit to us remains private, and that it is used only for the purposes described below. We aim to provide a safe and secure experience for all of our users. We make every effort to comply with our obligations under the 1998 Data Protection Act. Additionally, we understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of your CV and other information stored about you while using the site.</p>
</div>
<div class="moduleFooter750"></div>

<h2 class="cvlH2">Account and CV information</h2>
<p class="cvlSmall20">When you register to CV-Library your details, including your CV, can be made available for searching, viewing over the Internet and downloading by any direct recruiter, employment consultant or other person or organisation who requests CVs matching your profile to be sent to them. CV-Library attempts to verify the identity and the nature of the business of such organisations however does not make any warranties as to their authenticity.</p>

<h2 class="cvlH2">Your personal information</h2>
<p class="cvlSmall20">When you create or register your CV with us, we will collect personal information from you, such as your name, contact details, and other details. Once you register with CV-Library and accept our Terms &amp; Conditions, you are not anonymous to us. We may use information that you provide to alert you to our own products and services. We may contact you regarding site changes or changes to the CV-Library products or services that you use.</p>

<h2 class="cvlH2">Disclosure of personal information</h2>
<p class="cvlSmall">When you register, we store some information about you in your account, but it is protected by your password and may only be accessed by you. It does not form part of our candidate database and cannot be searched or accessed by CV-Library customers. You can delete your account at any time. Your CV, unless you choose the option to 'hide', will be accessible to any CV-Library customer. If you choose to hide your CV, all clients of CV-Library will be unable to view or access it.</p>
<p class="cvlSmall">If you choose to create a profile and upload a CV to our database, we rely on you to ensure that your details are kept up to date. You should update your CV at least every six months, particularly if your contact details have changed.</p>
<p class="cvlSmall">Please note that CV-Library reserves the right to remove from our database, CVs which include any content that we consider to be illegal or offensive.</p>
<p class="cvlSmall">We do not disclose information about your individual visits to the CV-Library site, or personal information that you provide, such as your name and personal contact details unless you have given us your permission or we believe that the law requires it. N.B. that by registering with CV-Library you are granting us permission to disclose this information unless you choose the option to 'hide'.

<h2 class="cvlH2">Information collection and use</h2>
<p class="cvlSmall">Like many websites, we routinely capture your IP address information to determine your location. This helps us work out whether you are visiting the site from within the UK, EU or rest of the world, and means we can show you content that's specific to your location and ask the right questions about your eligibility to work in the UK or EU should you wish to apply for a job on CV-Library. CV-Library automatically receives and records information on our web server logs from your browser including your IP address. CV-Library records IP addresses for anonymous statistical purposes, administration of our website and servers, and to improve our services.</p>
<p class="cvlSmall">An IP address, or 'internet protocol address', is a unique identifying number given to every device connected to the internet. Like a car license plate, an IP address is a special serial number used for identification.</p>
