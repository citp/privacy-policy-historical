This Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which we collect and use personal information about you as part of our ministry activities.

**Who is Responsible for the Personal Information That We Collect?**

**What Personal Information Do We Collect?**  
You provide most such information when you register, buy, post, participate in a contest or questionnaire, or communicate with us. For example, you provide information when you place an order for materials; provide information in Your Account (and you might have more than one account if you have used more than one e-mail address when registering with us); communicate with us by letter, phone or e-mail; complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form; or otherwise transmit such information to us. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, email address, and phone number; credit card information; the same information may have been supplied for the people to whom items have been shipped, including addresses and phone numbers; e-mail addresses; content of reviews and e-mails to us, and financial information. **NOTE:** Credit card numbers are used only for donation or payment processing and are not retained for other purposes.

During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.

CBN gathers information to more effectively operate its site and to help us personalize and improve your experience while using CBN sites. While some of the information collected is required for membership or necessary to use the services provided by the site, other information is voluntarily given by you as described above.

**Sensitive or Special Categories of Information**

Some countries consider some personal information particularly sensitive or special. CBN only collects this data when voluntarily given by the individual, such as for processing certain requests (when necessary), and for statistical purposes only. CBN does not share this information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Such information may include, but is not limited to, the following:

  * Date of birth

We collect this information for site administration purposes, such as to analyze this data for trends and statistics. We may share statistical or aggregated non-personal information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties.

**Who Do We Share Your Personal Information With?**

CBN reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party, if CBN has reason to believe that disclosing personal information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) its rights or property, other website users or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Additionally, CBN may disclose personal information in response to a subpoena, warrant or other court order, or when we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, subpoena, warrant or other court order requires it, or authorizes us to do so, or to respond to an emergency situation.

We may share information with other CBN and affiliated entities, such as between the CBN and CBN Europe. See more information with respect to such transfers under the section titled “ **Transfer of Personal Information Across Borders.** ”  We may also share your information with others, such as accountants and lawyers, who assist us in carrying out our activities.

CBN may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist CBN in providing services to you or to carry out one or more of the purposes described above. These service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide such assistance and are legally required to protect personal information disclosed by CBN and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we share your information with service providers, contractors and sub-contractors to help us provide the website, products, events and services. We may also use a service provider to process payment information, manage our events, provide analytics or use third party software to manage our customer relationship management system. When we use service providers we provide limited access to your information so that the service provider can perform the tasks on our behalf.  For more information about third party service providers, please see the [**_CBN Third Party Service Provider Information_**](http://www1.cbn.com/cbn-third-party-processor-information).

In addition to the uses and disclosure of personal information noted above, personal information of CBN members and registrants may be shared with other entities when we have obtained your consent prior to such disclosure. When you have provided consent, we share your limited information, including personal information, as described at the time of consent for the consented purpose.

**Transfer of Personal Information Across Borders**

CBN is a Christian organization with a global outreach, headquartered and operating in Virginia Beach, Virginia (USA). We may allow your personal information to be shared with our related entities or third-party service providers based both within the United States and in other countries. This may entail a transfer of your information from a location within the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) to outside the EEA, or from outside the EEA to a location within the EEA.

When we provide your personal information to a third party service in other global regions, we do so in connection with providing you with member benefits, requested information or services or as required or authorized under law. It is possible the global entities, with which we share your information with, may not be subject to foreign laws that provide the same level of protection of information as your country of residence or employment, or may not be subject to any privacy obligations. Global entities may be required or compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, such as an overseas authority.

CBN works to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our website and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal information, we will use reasonable and appropriate procedures and security features to prevent unauthorized access.

CBN also sends push notifications, the delivery of information from a software application to your mobile device through services such as Apple's Push Notification Service for iOS devices and Google's CD2M and Cloud Messaging for Android devices. Both services are standard features of these mobile device operating systems. CBN manages access, use and disclosure of your personal data that results from your use of these services.

**Your Rights, Including Removing, Correcting or Updating Personal Information**

If you wish change your consent about how CBN discloses or uses your information, or wish to access, correct or update personal information (such as your address), we will endeavor to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us.  Some information can be modified by you directly.  Examples of information you can access easily include recent orders; personally identifiable information (including name, e-mail, site password); payment settings (including credit card information); e-mail notification settings, including Alerts and newsletters.
