CBN may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist CBN in providing services to you or to carry out one or more of the purposes described above. These service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide such assistance and are legally required to protect personal information disclosed by CBN and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we share your information with service providers, contractors and sub-contractors to help us provide the website, products, events and services. We may also use a service provider to process payment information, manage our events, provide analytics or use third party software to manage our customer relationship management system. When we use service providers we provide limited access to your information so that the service provider can perform the tasks on our behalf.  For more information about third party service providers, please see the [**CBN Third Party Service Provider Information**](https://www1.cbn.com/cbn-third-party-processor-information).

**Transfer of Personal Information Across Borders**  
CBN is a Christian organization with a global outreach, headquartered and operating in Virginia Beach, Virginia (USA). We may allow your personal information to be shared with our related entities or third-party service providers based both within the United States and in other countries. This may entail a transfer of your information from a location within the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) to outside the EEA, or from outside the EEA to a location within the EEA.

When we provide your personal information to a third party service in other global regions, we do so in connection with providing you with member benefits, requested information or services or as required or authorized under law. It is possible the global entities, with which we share your information with, may not be subject to foreign laws that provide the same level of protection of information as your country of residence or employment, or may not be subject to any privacy obligations. Global entities may be required or compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, such as an overseas authority.

CBN works to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our website and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal information, we will use reasonable and appropriate procedures and security features to prevent unauthorized access.

CBN also sends push notifications, the delivery of information from a software application to your mobile device through services such as Apple's Push Notification Service for iOS devices and Google's CD2M and Cloud Messaging for Android devices. Both services are standard features of these mobile device operating systems. CBN manages access, use and disclosure of your personal data that results from your use of these services.

**Your Rights, Including Removing, Correcting or Updating Personal Information**  
If you wish change your consent about how CBN discloses or uses your information, or wish to access, correct or update personal information (such as your address), we will endeavor to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us.  Some information can be modified by you directly.  Examples of information you can access easily include recent orders; personally identifiable information (including name, e-mail, site password); payment settings (including credit card information); e-mail notification settings, including Alerts and newsletters.

**Superbook Privacy Policy**

CBN is committed to protecting your privacy and properly handling any personal information we obtain from you. This Kids' Privacy Policy supplements our general [Privacy Policy](http://en.superbook.tv/cbn_privacy_policy) by providing additional privacy measures for children who visit the Superbook Kids website, in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). COPPA requires that we inform parents and legal guardians (hereinafter "parents") about how CBN collects, uses and discloses personal information from children under age 13, and that we obtain the consent of parents when we collect personally identifiable information of children under age 13. Our information collection practices are described below. We encourage such "kids" to check with their parents before entering information on any website and we encourage parents to discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know.

**What Kind of Information Is Collected?**

The Superbook Kids website requires minimum collection of information from our visitors. In order for a kid to register on the Superbook Kids website, we collect only the kid's first name, kid's birth date, parent's email address, user name, and password. The birth date is collected in order to validate the age of the guest. All such information is collected so kids can participate in activities, play online games, and have a record of scores, accumulated points, and awards. The parent's email address is collected in order to provide direct notice to the parents of registration by their children under age 13, provide notices from time to time about their use of the website and information on feature updates and changes, conduct online contests or sweepstakes, or offer other online activities. We may not condition the participation by a kid in any of our online activities on the kid's providing more information than is reasonably necessary. The kids also are able to email or call us and interact with one of our trained prayer counselors, which would include the collection of the email address or telephone number that he or she uses.

**Parental Consent**

When kids request a Superbook Kids website account, we send to the parents an email with a link that can be used to create a kid’s account by specifying the username and password for the kid’s account. If the parent creates a kid account, the parent is consenting and agreeing that it is acceptable for the kid to be registered, enter Superbook contests or sweepstakes, create a publicly viewable cartoon character avatar and username that is displayed in locations such as the account profile pages and game leaderboards, and to contact the Superbook team for prayer or technical support. If a parent creates or permits the registration or entry, the kid will be able to proceed with all such activities described in this policy without further parental notification or consent. Parents will be notified using the parent email address provided at registration if their child wins a contest or sweepstakes. If the parent would like to receive the prize, the parent will need to provide their address for delivery of the prize.

**How Information May Be Disclosed**

CBN generally does not disclose to third parties personally identifiable information that children under age 13 provide, except occasionally we may share such information with third parties who may be engaged by CBN specifically to handle and deliver certain online activities (e.g., conducting contests and sweepstakes). Such third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their services, but may not use it for other purposes. We may also disclose personally identifiable information to third parties in order to comply with law, judicial process, or requests by law enforcement agencies, to enforce our [Terms of Use](https://www1.cbn.com/terms-of-use), to protect the property or security of our website, or to take reasonable measures to protect the rights, property or safety of CBN and others.

**Push Notifications**

We send push notifications, the delivery of information from a software application to your mobile device through services such as Apple's Push Notification Service for iOS devices and Google's CD2M and Cloud Messaging for Android devices. Both services are standard features of these mobile device operating systems. CBN manages access, use and disclosure of your personal data that results from your use of these services.

**Parental Access**

CBN wants to help parents ensure that their kids have a safe and fun online experience. Parents can [contact us](http://en.superbook.tv/contact) if they are interested in reviewing any identifiable information collected about their child, have this information deleted, and/or require that there be no further collection or use of their child's information. CBN endeavors to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child, to be reasonably certain that the person is in fact the child's parent.

**Changes to Superbook Privacy Policy**

CBN may amend this policy at any time. Parents of registered kids will be notified of any material changes that pertain to the collection, use or disclosure of kids' personal information. We encourage parents to advise us of any changes to their email addresses.
