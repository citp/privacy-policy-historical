# Website Privacy Policy | U.S. Customs and Border Protection

This is an official website of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and is provided as a public service. Information presented on the site is considered public information and may be distributed or copied for non-commercial purposes, except where third party copyright notification exists. Use of appropriate byline/photo/image credits is requested.

**Information Collection and Use**

CBP follows the[ privacy policy ](https://www.dhs.gov/privacy-policy)of the Department of Homeland Security.  Accordingly, it is CBP’s policy to explain how the personally identifiable information (PII) that you provide to us when you visit us online to browse, obtain information, or conduct a transaction.  

As a general rule, CBP does not collect PII about you when you visit our website, unless you choose to provide such information to us. Submitting PII through our website is voluntary. By doing so, you are giving the Department your permission to use the information for a specific, stated purpose.

If you choose to provide us with PII through such methods as completing a web form, we will use that information to help us provide you the information or service you have requested. The information we may receive from you varies based on what you do when visiting our site.

We only share the PII you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. We never create individual profiles or give your PII to any private organizations. CBP never collects information for commercial marketing.

If we store your PII in a record system designed to retrieve information about you by personal identifier (name, personal email address, home mailing address, personal or mobile phone number, etc.), so that we may contact you, we will safeguard the information you provide to us in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). The Act requires all public-facing sites or forms that request PII to prominently and conspicuously display a privacy notice.

The notice must address the following criteria:

  1. Legal authorization to collect information about you;
  2. Purpose for which the information will be used;
  3. Routine uses for disclosure of information outside of the Department of Homeland Security;
  4. Whether your providing the information is voluntary or mandatory under law; and
  5. Effects if you choose to not provide the requested information.



For the general contact information that may be submitted through [www.cbp.gov](http://www.cbp.gov/), we have completed a [Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)](https://www.dhs.gov/privacy-documents-us-customs-and-border-protection) and [System of Records Notice (SORN)](https://www.dhs.gov/system-records-notices-sorns) providing details about the privacy protections and redress options available for the contact information we collect from the public. This information may be used to distribute information to you and to perform various administrative tasks.
