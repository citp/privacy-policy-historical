&nbsp; <br>
Welcome to the website of the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (CBMW). 
The following information is designed to allow you to understand our information gathering 
practices and to assure you of our commitment to your privacy.  If you have any questions 
that are not answered here, please e-mail <a href="mailto:webmaster@cbmw.org">
webmaster@cbmw.org</a>.</p>


<p> &nbsp; </p>



<p><b>SHARING OF INFORMATION</b><br> &nbsp; <br>
Before we go into detail about our privacy policy, let us make a promise to you: <br>
<b>The information you provide or that is collected by CBMW will <u>never</u> be shared with 
any third party organization without your expressed permission.  </b></p>


<p> &nbsp; </p>


<p><b>COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br> &nbsp; <br>
While visiting our site, CBMW will not collect any personal information without 
your knowledge.  There are parts of our site that require personal information, 
such as making purchases from our store, contacting us, requesting our free gifts, 
subscribing to the Journal, or joining our mailing lists.  The only information we 
collect in these areas is the information that you provide.  Your participation in 
providing this information is completely optional (please see below for how we 
use the information that you chose to provide).  Apart from these areas, no 
personal information is collected about you. </p>

<p>The personal information we collect is only the information that you specifically 
provide to us.  We do not associate this personal information with your particular 
visit (i.e. we do not know what pages you looked at, what site you came from, etc…).  
The information you provide will be sent to our office staff but it will never be used to 
identify you on this or subsequent visits to our web site.</p>

<p>When you provide personal information, we will use it to fulfill the expectation 
presented on the page in which you provided it.  For example, personal information 
provided in our store will be used to correctly bill you for your order and ship the 
products to you.  Personal information provided in our contact and feedback areas will 
be used to properly respond to your request or comments.  <i>Personal information 
collected from requesting the free gift on the site, subscribing to the Journal, adding 
yourself to our mailing list, and making purchases from our store may be used to 
add you to our client database and mailing list.</i>  If you prefer not to be in our 
database or on our mailing list, either do not participate in providing your information on 
these pages or opt out by contacting our administrative offices at 1-888-560-8210.</p>


<p> &nbsp; </p>


<p><b>COLLECTION AND USE OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION</b><br> &nbsp; <br>
Some technical information is collected by our servers when you visit our site. 
<b>The technical information collected is never associated with your identity 
or with any personal information that you chose to provide. </b> Examples of technical 
information that may be collected include your IP address, where you came from when visiting 
our site, how long you stayed at CBMW, what pages you viewed while you were here, and 
what browser you were using.  Again, this information is only seen in log files and is never 
associated with any personal information. It is used to help us diagnose problems on our 
site, see what areas are most frequently visited, and to find ways to enhance your browsing 
experience. </p>


<p> &nbsp; </p>

<p><b>COOKIES</b><br> &nbsp; <br> 
Cookies are small, plain-text files that are written to your computer’s 
hard drive.  They are often used to personalize or enhance your browsing 
experience or to identify you to a web site (such as through remembering 
your username or password).  <b>Because of our concern for your 
privacy, we do <u>not</u> utilize cookies apart from the shopping 
carts of our on-line store, journal subscription form, and on-line 
donation form.</b>  Cookies are only used in our store in order to 
track your shopping cart so that your order may be accurately associated 
with you and processed.  After completing your order, these cookies 
expire.  The cookies used in our on-line store are never seen by our servers 
outside of the store area (i.e. they are never used to see what other parts 
of our site you visit, etc…).  If you prefer to avoid cookies, you may disable 
them in your browser settings. </p>


<p> &nbsp; </p>


<p><b>LINKS</b><br> &nbsp; <br>
The CBMW web site contains links to other web sites.   These links are 
provided for your benefit and do <i>not</i> represent an endorsement or 
approval by CBMW of the site’s content or message or of the organization or 
people behind that organization or site.  We are not responsible for the 
content or privacy practices of these sites. </p>


<p> &nbsp; </p>


<p><b>SECURITY</b><br> &nbsp; <br>
General correspondence sent through the CBMW web pages (such as 
sending e-mails or comments to us through our on-line forms) is not 
secure unless specifically noted.  Do not send sensitive information through 
these means.  It could <i>potentially</i> be viewed by a third party while 
in transit.</p>

<p><b>Our on-line store and all other areas on our site used to make 
purchases or donations are secure. </b> We use industry standard 
SSL connections (provided by a large and well-respected Internet hosting 
company) for the transmission of payment and billing information.  This 
ensures that the information you provide is encrypted and unable to be 
viewed by third parties while being transmitted.</p>
