      <p><span class="heading3">Personal Messaging</span></p>
      <p>          <span class="bodytext">  It is the policy of CBSEGuess.com to send our members only the types of pm they elect to receive in addition to cbseguess.com customary business communications (address confirmation, renewal notifications, new product offerings, etc.) Further, it is our policy to remove members from any cbseguess.com mailing list to which they have subscribed upon request (members will continue to receive customary business communications from cbseguess.com). At any time, members can update their email preferences list via the "My Page" button. In addition, every subscribed email communication from cbseguess.com will contain clear and obvious instructions for how the member can remove himself or herself from that mailing list.</span></p>
      <p class="bodytext"><span class="heading3">Membership Registration</span></p>
      <p class="bodytext"> Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor your experience at cbseguess.com, showing content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. We do this in two ways. First, we analyze member’s information in aggregate - that is, we collect information about thousands of site visits and analyze it as a whole. This kind of study involves looking for trends among many visitors to cbseguess.com, rather than analyzing information about any individual member. Examples include researching which parts of the site are accessed most frequently, or determining which products are most attractive to our users. Second, we may use information gathered during your visit to help customize our communications with you. </p>
      <p class="bodytext"> CBSEGuess.com may periodically conduct individual voluntary member surveys. We encourage our members to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer, and how we provide them to you. The responses we collect in online surveys are anonymous. In the end, we hope to tailor our communications with you to fit your needs - so that you receive more of what you want from us and less of what you don't want.</p>
