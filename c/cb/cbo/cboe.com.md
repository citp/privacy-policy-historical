# CBOE - Privacy Statement

Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated ("CBOE") has created this Privacy Statement and Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of the users of a CBOE World Wide Website ("Website"). By using or accessing the Website, you signify your acknowledgment and assent to the Privacy Statement and Policy set forth below: 

### Information Collection and Dissemination

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Statement and Policy, the following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Website. 

In general, users can visit the Website anonymously without providing any personal information. There are, however, cases where users may be asked for personal information. For example, online surveys are occasionally conducted to better understand the needs and profiles of our Website users. Our online surveys typically ask users for demographic and profile information such as zip code, age, and income level. In addition, personal information is requested if you voluntarily register to receive additional information about CBOE or if you want to purchase a product directly from the Website. Our voluntary Website registration form requests user personal information such as name, mailing address and/or e-mail address. Registered Users have certain "opt-out" choices which are described in the choice/opt-out section below. CBOE shares information with advertisers on an aggregate basis, but users should refer to the privacy statements (accessible below) of the service providers to the Website for their policies regarding use of personal information. 

### Security

CBOE shall exercise reasonable precautions to safeguard and secure all information provided by users in connection with accessing this Website. The Website has security measures in place that help to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Although we take proper measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information and because such information can be accessed through the Internet, no assurances can be provided to users that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Statement and Policy. 

### Logged Files

The Website logs IP addresses and browser types for administration purposes. Such logs will be reviewed in order to improve the materials and content available on the Website. 

### Policies for Children

CBOE does not knowingly collect or use any personal information from users under 13 years of age. No information should be submitted to this Website by guests under 13 years of age. 

### Links to Third Party Websites and Framing

For the user?s convenience, cboe.com provides links to other external websites. The listing of a link by CBOE should not be construed as a sponsorship, endorsement or approval of such websites, their content, or as an indication of the value of any claims, recommendations or other information contained therein. It is strongly advised that a qualified investment professional be consulted prior to engaging in any transactions. Users should be aware that the CBOE has no control over any linked website and is not responsible for the contents or privacy practices of any linked website or any link on a linked website. CBOE urges our users to be aware when they exit the Website and to carefully read the privacy statements of each website that collects user identifiable information. The Website Privacy Statement and Policy is applicable only to information collected by the Website. 

CBOE prohibits the framing of any materials available through its Website, caching, or unauthorized hypertext links to the Website. CBOE reserves the right to disconnect or otherwise disable any unauthorized frames or hypertext links. 

### Supplementation Information

The Website supplements the information that we provide with information that is received from third parties. 

### Notice of Changes

CBOE reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Statement and Policy or the Terms and Conditions for use of the Website at any time. Accordingly, if such changes are made, we will disclose those changes on the Website so that users are aware of our policies concerning information collection, use, and disclosure. Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting to the Website. 

### Choice/Opt-Out

The Website provides registered users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request information about the user. If you opt in, CBOE may (1) share the information with those organizations with which CBOE has a direct or indirect business relationship; (2) use the information for its own internal purposes, or (3) contact you for market-related research. 

If you choose to update or delete personal information previously provided, CBOE will endeavor to correct, update or remove the personal information from our database. You can do this by contacting our User Support organization at the contact points specified below. 

If you prefer not to receive traditional mail or other off-line promotions from CBOE or from organizations with which CBOE has a direct or indirect business relationship, please e-mail [remove@cboe.com](mailto:remove@cboe.com). Please include your full name and mailing address.

CBOE reserves the right to disclose user information in special cases, when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other Website users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose personal information without notice to you in response to a subpoena, or when requested from a United States government regulatory body or law enforcement agency, when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or to respond to any emergency situation.
