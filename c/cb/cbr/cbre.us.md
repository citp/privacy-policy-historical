By clicking on and through to a link or promotion on our Site, **you agree to allow us to receive and use any information** (except for credit card information) **that you may provide to our partners** , under the same terms and conditions as if you provided your information directly to us. We are not, however, responsible for any other Web site, or their respective privacy policy or how they treat information about their users. **We strongly advise you to review their privacy policies to find out how they are treating your personal information**.

**Third Party Usage:**

You may also separately share your information with other Web sites or entities, such as those that create professional marketing lists, to receive special offers and promotions from their affiliates. **These Web sites or entities may agree to share your information with us**. Whether any third party actually shares your information with us and to what extent they do share your information with us will depend on their agreement with us and their respective privacy policies.

We may also associate this marketing data to the personally identifiable information that you provide to us.

  5. **Personal Information We Share**

**Vendors:  **

We may share your personal information with companies acting as our authorized agents in providing our services (e.g., customer/support services) to you, all of which agree to use your information only for such specified purposes. Each vendor must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of your information in order to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. **Because we operate globally, we may transfer your information to countries or jurisdictions that do not provide the same level of data protection as the country in which you are based**. If we make such a transfer, we will, or our vendors will, as applicable, provide for the proper safeguards required by applicable law to ensure that your information is protected.

We may also share your personal information with CBRE affiliates in order to provide or offer services to you.

**Legally Compelled Disclosure:  **

We will also disclose your personal information when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement agency's requirements, or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing your personal information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (whether intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property.
