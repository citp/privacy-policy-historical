When you visit or transact business on this Site, you may be required to register with us or be requested to provide us with personal and account information. When you provide us with this information, we may use it to contact you about the offerings or services in which you have expressed an interest. CBRE has a legitimate business interest to use the personal information we collect from you to provide such requested services. Where we have relied on your consent, however, if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information as a basis for further contact with you (by accessing our opt-out procedure described below), we will respect your wishes.

Communications With You – Newsletters and Marketing Purposes:

In order to keep our users and clients informed about our latest news, products and services, we may send e-mails and marketing communications to the email address provided to us while registering on our Site or requesting information from us. CBRE complies with applicable laws when using your personal information for this purpose, and where applicable (such as in the EU) relies on your consent. Please be aware that we do sometimes partner with third parties to send marketing communications that promote a third party’s products and services (for example, those of our business partners) as well as our own. If you elected to opt–in to any of our email lists, newsletters or other promotional offerings and later decide that you no longer wish to receive such newsletters or promotional e-mail from us, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions contained in each email we send to you (or use the opt-out procedure described below).

Professional Interactions With You – Customer Relationship Management:

We may use your client relationship data (collected via a business card with a CBRE employee or when you communicate with a CBRE employee via phone or email, for example) to provide you with services you request and manage our relationship with you. We may also use certain de-identified and aggregated data about our clients for our internal data analytics purposes. CBRE has a legitimate business interest to use the personal information we collect from you to provide such requested services and in order to be able to service our clients better. With your consent, we may send you information or services or a promotional nature that we consider may be relevant to you.

Other Uses:

We may also use the personal information we obtain about you for the following purposes:

We also may use the information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection. If you object to us using information in other ways you can email [PrivacyAdministrator@CBRE.com](mailto:PrivacyAdministrator@CBRE.com).

* **Information** **Provided to Us** **About You** ******by** **Third Parties**

Third-Party Content:

We may present or embed content on our Site, such as property listings, that is provided by our third-party vendors. This content may contain links to other sites not operated by CBRE or may request personal information. For example, this content may ask for an email address to subscribe to alerts or share a listing with a friend. This information is collected by our vendors and not by us. In some cases, these vendors may share the personal information they collect from you with us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our vendors. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to understand how they will use and share the personal information you provide to them.

Third Party Usage:

You may also separately share your information with other Web sites or entities, such as those that create professional marketing lists, to receive special offers and promotions from their affiliates. **These Web sites or entities may share your information with us**. CBRE is not responsible for and assumes no liability if a partner or other Web site or entity collects, uses or shares, any information about you in violation of its own privacy policy, or applicable law.

Marketing Data:

Where applicable law allows, we will purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers in which we think you would be interested. We may also associate this marketing data to the personally identifiable information that you provide to us.

* Third Parties with Whom We Share Your Personal Information

Third Parties for Retargeting Advertising:

We will, in some cases, share information about how you use our Site with third-party vendors to present you with more relevant advertising. For example, our vendors may track your browsing activity on our Site using cookies to show you ads based on your interests when you browse the Web or use social media. Our vendors will, in some cases, also share information about your browsing activity on our Site with us for analytics purposes. **CBRE relies on your consent for such processing of your personal information.** More information on these cookies, including how to provide or revoke your consent, may be found in our Cookie Policy below.

Service Providers: 

We may share your personal information with companies acting as our authorized agents in providing our services, including the following categories of service provider: 

  * infrastructure and IT service providers, including cloud service providers

  * marketing, advertising and communications agencies

  * external auditors and advisors

  * cookie analytics providers

  * online advertisers

  * providers of website testing / analytics services




Each service provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of your information in order to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. **Because we operate globally, we may transfer your information to countries or jurisdictions that do not provide the same level of data protection as the country in which you are based**. If we make such a transfer, we will, or our vendors will, as applicable, provide for the proper safeguards required by applicable law to ensure that your information is protected. More information on International Data Transfers of your personal information is below.

Where we share your personal information for our legitimate interests you can object to this disclosure. Please be aware that when you object to disclosure of your personal information for CBRE’s legitimate interests it may affect the services we provide to you. More information on Your Rights are below.

Legally Affiliated Entities:

In the event that CBRE is merged, or in the event of a transfer of our assets, Site or operations, CBRE may disclose or transfer your personal information in connection with such transaction. In the event of such a transfer, CBRE will notify you via email or by posting a prominent notice on our Site for 30 days of any such change in ownership of CBRE resulting in a change of control of your personal information. We may also share your personal information with CBRE affiliates in order to provide or offer services to you.

Legally Compelled Disclosure:

We will also disclose your personal information when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement agency's requirements, or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing your personal information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (whether intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property. 

* International Data Transfers

Processing In the US and Elsewhere by Registration on This Site 

CBRE is a global business. We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to recipients, and your personal information may be stored and processed, in countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected, including the United States and elsewhere that may have less stringent data protection laws than the country in which you initially provided the information. 

When we transfer your information to countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected, we will protect your information as described in this Policy or as otherwise disclosed to you at the time the data is collected (e.g. via program specific privacy notice) and will comply with all applicable data protection laws in making such transfers.
