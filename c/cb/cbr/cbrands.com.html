<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Links To Other Websites</u></strong><br>On this Site, we may provide as a convenience to you links to other websites, including sites operated by us, our partners, associates, or independent third parties.&nbsp; These links are provided as a convenience to you.&nbsp; Each website has its own privacy practices, as described in that site's privacy policy.&nbsp; Those practices may be different than the practices described herein, and we urge you to read each website's privacy policy carefully before you use or submit information to that site.&nbsp; Additionally, to the extent that you follow a link to a website operated by an independent third party, please be aware that we exercise no authority or control over that third party, and cannot and are not responsible for any information that you may submit at that site.&nbsp;</p>
