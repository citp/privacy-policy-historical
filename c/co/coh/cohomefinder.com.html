  <br>
  <b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Information Collection</b><br>
  Colorado HomeFinder is the sole owner of the information collected on the site 
  www.COhomefinder.com. Colorado HomeFinder collects information from our users 
  at several different points on our Web site.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Registration</b><br>
  In order to use this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form. 
  During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as 
  first name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about 
  services on our site for which he has expressed interest, such as sending new 
  listings as part of the Automated HomeAlert system. It is optional for the user 
  to provide real estate related information (such as relocation plans and search 
  criteria), and unique identifiers (such as, username and password), but encouraged 
  so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site and the most effective 
  real estate services. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Information Use</b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Profile</b><br>
  We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, 
  and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information 
  that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, 
  collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information 
  to improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor 
  a user's visit to our Web site and to direct pertinent real estate information 
  to them. <b>We do not share personal profiles with any other third parties. 
  Personal profiles can only be only be accessed by designated Colorado HomeFinder 
  employees and REALTORS. </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Cookies</b><br>
  A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information 
  about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the 
  session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. 
  A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for 
  an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet 
  browser help file directions.<br>
  <br>
  By setting a cookie on our site, users do not have to log in a password more 
  than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, 
  they may still use our site. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target 
  the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. See the "Profile" 
  section.<br>
  <br>
  <b>No Third Party Advertising</b><br>
  <b>No third party advertisers are allowed on the Web site www.COhomefinder.com, 
  nor does Colorado HomeFinder share any personal profile information of its users 
  with any third party advertiser. </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Log Files</b><br>
  Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet 
  protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit 
  pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, 
  administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad 
  demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked 
  to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally 
  identifiable information to enable and enhance our Web-based service. We use 
  a custom tracking utility that uses log files to analyze use of the site and 
  serve our clients. <br>
  <b><br>
  Communications from the Site</b></p>
<p><b>Market Updates and New Listings</b><br>
  The Automated HomeAlert system emails users when new listings that match a user's 
  search criteria are posted on the Multiple Listing Service in their search area.</p>
<p><b>Services and Market Updates</b><br>
  We send all new members a welcoming email to explain the services provided by 
  Colorado HomeFinder. Established members will occasionally receive information 
  about our services, market updates, home buying or selling tips, and a newsletter. 
  Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive 
  these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Newsletter</b><br>
  If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information 
  such as email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way 
  to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Colorado HomeFinder Client Care </b><br>
  Our Client Care team communicates with users on a regular basis to provide requested 
  services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email 
  or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.</p>
<p><b>Colorado HomeFinder REALTORS</b><br>
  We partner with REALTORS that serve specific geographic markets to provide real 
  estate services to Colorado HomeFinder users that expressly request the services 
  of a REALTOR. When the user requests these particular services, the appropriate 
  Colorado HomeFinder REALTOR receives the user's name, contact information, and 
  home search criteria in order to provide real estate services to the user. </p>
<p><b>Service Announcements</b><br>
  On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. 
  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might 
  send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, 
  though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are 
  not promotional in nature. </p>
<p><b>Business Transitions</b><br>
  In the event Colorado HomeFinder goes through a business transition, such as 
  a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, 
  users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. 
</p>
<p><b>Choice/Opt-out</b><br>
  Users who no longer wish to receive Automated HomeAlert emails, our newsletter 
  and/or general communications may opt-out of receiving these communications 
  by <a href="/cohomefinder/HomePage.do?state=promptContactUs" target="_top"><strong>clicking here to contact 
      us.</strong></a> The user may also contact us by phone at (303) 543-3083 or mail at 4770 Baseline Road, Suite 200, Boulder, 
  CO 80303 to opt-out. </p>
<p><b>Links</b><br>
  This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Colorado 
  HomeFinder is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. 
  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the 
  privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable 
  information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected 
  by this Web site.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Surveys &amp; Contests </b><br>
  From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. 
  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user 
  therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested 
  information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping 
  address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information 
  will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Anonymous survey information 
  will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction 
  of this site. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with 
  third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary 
  to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable 
  information for any secondary purposes. <br>
  <b><br>
  Tell-A-Friend</b><br>
  If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our 
  site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Colorado HomeFinder 
  will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the 
  site. Colorado HomeFinder stores this information for the sole purpose of sending 
  this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. The friend 
  may contact Colorado HomeFinder to request the 
  removal of this information from our database.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Security</b><br>
  This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When 
  users submit information via the Web site, their information is protected both 
  online and off-line.<br>
  <br>
  The information that a user provides when registering on www.COhomefinder.com 
  is stored in our secure database that is only accessible by designated Colorado 
  HomeFinder employees. <br>
  <br>
  Not only do we protect user-information online, we also do everything in our 
  power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information is 
  restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform 
  a specific job (for example, our customer service representatives) are granted 
  access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are 
  kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well 
  as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded 
  about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our 
  users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally 
  identifiable information are in a secure environment in a locked facility. <br>
  <b><br>
  If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can call us at (303) 543-3083 or <a href="/cohomefinder/HomePage.do?state=promptContactUs" target="_top"><strong> click here to contact 
      us.</strong></a></b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</b><br>

  or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a 
  way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. 
  This can be done at the "Update Profile" page, or by contacting Client 
  Care at (303) 543-3083. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
  If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this 
  privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our 
  users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under 
  what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. <br>
  If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information 
  in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify 
  users via email. <br>
