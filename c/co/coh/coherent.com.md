**Coherent, Inc. Privacy Statement**

Coherent is committed to protecting your privacy, so you can visit most pages on our site without providing information about yourself. However, sometimes we need information to provide services that you request, and this privacy statement explains data collection in those situations. 

**Collection of your personal information**

Generally, we request personal information when you are entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, signing up for an event or training, or purchasing products. 

Personal information is usually limited to name, e-mail address, and phone number, unless other information is needed to provide the service you requested.

Coherent also collects information about your computer hardware and software, including your IP address, browser types, operating system, domain name, access times and Web site addresses. We use this information to maintain the quality of our Web site, and to obtain general statistics regarding its use.

Coherent also collects information about which pages customers visit. Only a unique ID number identifies this site visitation data, and it is never linked with personal information.

**Use of your personal information**

We use your personal information for the following purposes:

To ensure our site is relevant to your needs.

To make the site easier to use by eliminating the need to enter information more than once.

To complete online purchases. 

To deliver newsletters, product literature, news of events, training schedules, software updates, etc.

We merge site-visitation data with anonymous demographic information for research purposes, and may use this information to provide more relevant content. 

Unless otherwise stated on the Site, we will share your personal information only with associated financial institutions, in order to verify credit information for an online purchase or to establish an account. 

Coherent will disclose your personal information only in special cases, such as: (i) to comply with valid legal requirements, such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (ii) when Coherent believes that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who, intentionally or unintentionally, may be causing injury or harm to Coherent users or other persons, or may be violating the Terms and Conditions of Use for this site.

If you do not want Coherent to communicate with you about other Coherent products, programs, events or services, by e-mail, postal mail, or telephone, you can select the "Do not wish to receive marketing messages from Coherent" option when prompted.

Your personal information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Coherent or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities. By using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Coherent abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, regarding the collection, use and retention of data from the European Union.

**Security of your personal information**

Coherent is committed to protecting your personal information. We use various security technologies to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When we transmit sensitive information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we use encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

**Non-personally identifiable information**  
 **Internet Protocol (IP) Address**

A unique number, called an Internet Protocol (IP) address, identifies every computer on the Internet. Each time you connect to the Internet, your machine is assigned an IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our Site, to more efficiently administer the Site, and to better tailor it to your needs. 

**Cookies**

When you enter our Site, we create your profile, assign you a personal identification number, and then send this personal identification number back to your hard drive in the form of a "cookie." 

This cookie is a very small bit of code (a few kilobytes) that contains no personal information. But, this code is uniquely yours and allows you to navigate our Site without having to fill out registration forms with information you have already provided (as long as you are using the same computer from which you initially supplied the information).

Other cookies, written as you navigate our Site, allow us to remember what is in your on-line shopping cart and provide you with the proper pricing for your location (U.S, Europe, Asia, etc.). 

If you are interrupted before finalizing an on-line purchase, the contents of your order will be preserved for up to two weeks. 

Should you delete these cookies, you would simply provide your contact information again, but would "lose" the contents of your shopping cart.

Should you decide to set your browser to reject cookies, you can still browse the Site, but on-line ordering and item prices will not be available. 

We do not sell customer lists or "cookie swap" with other companies. 

**Changes to this statement**

Coherent, Inc. will occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will revise the "last updated" date on this page. For material changes to this statement, Coherent, Inc. will notify you by placing prominent notice on the Web site.
