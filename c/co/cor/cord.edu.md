# Concordia College Online Privacy Policy

**About the Concordia College Web Site**

Concordia College is committed to the privacy of all constituents. This policy refers to the gathering and dissemination practices for all domains owned by the college, including: [www.cord.edu](http://www.cord.edu/); [www.concordiacollege.edu](http://www.concordiacollege.edu/); [www.goconcordia.com](http://www.goconcordia.com/); [www.gocobbers.com](http://www.gocobbers.com/);  [www.concordiarecordings.com](http://www.concordiarecordings.com/); [www.concordiatickets.com](http://www.concordiatickets.com/); [www.concordiachristmas.com](http://www.concordiachristmas.com/); [www.concordialanguagevillages.org](http://www.concordialanguagevillages.org/); and [www4.cord.edu](http://www4.cord.edu/). 

**Information Collected**

Concordia College occasionally collects information from our users at different points on our web sites. Typical points of collection are forms, newsletter subscription pages and e-commerce pages. 

_**Forms**_  
There are a number of forms throughout the site including, but not limited to, an online application for admission, information requests, contests and event registrations.

**_eCommerce_**  
We request information from the user on order forms. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill a customer’s order. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. All online purchase transactions are done on a secure server hosted off-site.

_**Newsletters**_  
If a user wishes to subscribe to any of our newsletters, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.  Out of respect for our users’ privacy, we provide a way to opt out of these communications.  Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

 **How Information is Used**

Information gathered through our site is used only for the purpose stated.

**_Cookies_**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. Cookie use is very rare on our site and is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information. We exclusively use session  ID cookies, which terminate once a user closes their browser. Some of our third-party intermediaries use cookies on our site. These cookies are used strictly for improving the user experience.   

**_Log Files_**  
Like most standard web site servers we use log files.  This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We use a tracking utility called WebTrends that uses log files to analyze user movement. 

**How is Information Shared?**

**_As Required by Law_**  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our web site.

**_With Third Parties_**  
Some of our technology partners have access to personally identifiable information. They do not retain, share or use this information for any secondary purposes.

_**Third Party Intermediaries**_  
We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

_**Service Providers**_  
We partner with third partiesto provide specific services (online purchases, for example). When the user requests these particular services, we share information necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

 **Choice/Opt Out**

Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of receiving information from us. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter(s) and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by sending an email with a subject of “unsubscribe” to [enews@cord.edu](mailto:enews@cord.edu).  We also offer an opt out mechanism on all of our e-mail communications. Users may also contact us via phone, fax or e-mail or postal mail to opt out. Contact information is provided at the bottom of this policy.

Users of our site are always notified when information is being collected by any outside parties.  We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.

 **Links**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Concordia College is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site. 

**_Surveys & Contests_**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as class year).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.  Users’ personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users’ personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.     
_**  
Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums**_  
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, guestbooks, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

 **Security**

This web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.  When users submit sensitive information via the web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information offline. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use a password-protected logon screen. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment. ****

If users have any questions about the security at our web site, users can send an email to webmaster@cord.edu

 **Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information**

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at http://www.cord.edu/about/update/ ****or by emailing[webmaster@cord.edu](mailto:webmaster@cord.edu).

 **Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our web site for 30 days.
