								    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
								    <p>Corp-Corp.com (“we” or “us”) is committed to protecting any personal information that you provide to us through web sites owned and operated by Corp-Corp.com, including <a href="http://www.corp-corp.com" target="_blank">http://www.corp-corp.com</a> (the “Web Site”).  We believe it is important for you to know how we protect your personal information to deliver you the best user experience possible. This Privacy Policy pertains to information that is collected online, unless otherwise noted herein.</p>
								    <p>BY USING THE WEB SITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND TO OUR PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES STATED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE WEB SITE.</p>
								    <ol>
								        <li>
								            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
								            <p>We collect two types of information about you when you visit our Web Site: personally identifiable information and non-personal, aggregate information (such as information regarding the pages on our Site that you have visited and your IP address).</p>
								            <b><em>(A) Personally Identifiable Information</em></b>
								            <p>“Personally Identifiable Information” is information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, citizenship / visa status, telephone number, fax number, email address, or company name. We collect and store the personal information that you have provided to us. Here are some examples of the ways in which we may collect your personal information on the Web Site:</p>
								            <ul>
								                <li>As part of your registration as a job seeker on the Web Site;</li>
								                <li>As part of your registration as a recruiter on the Web Site;</li>
								                <li>As part of entering and participating in contests and promotions;</li>
								                <li>When you use services or tools on the Web Site including “Forward this to a Friend” or referral features;</li>
								                <li>When submitting information for editorial purposes including news items, press releases, or other items of interest;</li>
								                <li>When you submit comments on the Web Site’s feedback page;</li>
								                <li>When you contact us for assistance through our 24/7 Support Center;</li>
								                <li>When your name, email address, telephone number, fax number are referred by another recruiter, employer, job seeker; and</li>
								                <li>When you are registering for events or conferences.</li>
								            </ul>
								            <p>The above list provides an example of the personal information that may be collected by Corp-Corp.com. From time to time, we may collect personal information from you in other ways that are not described above. If you do not want us to collect your personal information, please do not provide it to us. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the personally identifiable information that you submit to Corp-Corp.com. Inaccurate information will affect the information you receive when using our Web Site and tools and our ability to contact you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
								            <em>(B) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</em>
								            <p>Here are some examples of the non-personally identifiable information that is collected via the Web Site and a description of how this information is used:</p>
								            <ul>
								                <li><b>Internet Protocol (IP) address:</b>  Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data. We use this information to deliver our Web Site to you upon request, to tailor our Web Site to the interests of our users and to measure traffic within our Web Site.</li>
								                <li><b>Cookie:</b>  A “cookie” is a small text file placed on your computer’s hard disk that may be used to collect information about your activity on the Web Site. For example, when someone visits a page within the Web Site, a cookie is placed on the user’s machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the Web Site previously. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users to our Web Site.</li>
								                <li><b>Web Beacons</b> (also known as “clear gifs,” “web bugs” or “pixel tags”):  “Web Beacons” are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Web Site and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages.</li>
								            </ul>
								            <p>We also may collect non-personally identifiable information from you in order to customize your experience, fulfill your requests for information, and improve our services.  We may provide this non-personally identifiable information to third parties. For example, we might inform third parties about the number of users of our Web Site and the activities they conduct while on the Web Site. We also may provide trusted partners with general information regarding our users and visitors.</p>
								            <p>Finally, Corp-Corp.com may combine any public information you provide in any of the public areas on the Web Site with non-personally identifiable information to create aggregate data. This information may also be disclosed to third parties. Aggregate data does not contain any information that could be used to contact you or identify you personally.</p>
								        </li>
								        <li>
								            <h2>Use and Disclosure of Personally Identifiable and Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h2><br style="font:normal 3px verdana;">

								            <p>All recruiters who pay for access to the Web Site may access your resume. We use our best efforts to grant access to these database services only to recruiters, headhunters, staffing firms, and employment search consultants. However, we cannot guarantee that other parties will not, without our consent, gain access to these services.</p>
								            <p>You may remove your resume or corporate profile from our Web Site at any time. However, parties with authorized access to the Web Site may have retained a copy of your resume or corporate profile in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes or corporate profiles in these instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes and corporate profiles by any of such parties while resumes and corporate profiles are in their database.</p>
