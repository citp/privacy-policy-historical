# Privacy Policy | CorePower Yoga

**Privacy Policy**

Effective date: May 1, 2015

CorePower Yoga, LLC (“CorePower Yoga,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) owns and operates this website (this “Site”). This Online Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) describes our commitment to privacy and reflects the importance we place on earning and keeping your trust.

**Scope of This Policy**  
This Policy applies to the information we collect from or about you through this Site. It does not apply to information we collect through other channels, such as over phone or in person, at our studios. Some of the information CorePower Yoga collects through this Site may be “personal information”—information that identifies you personally, alone or in combination with other information available to us. Other information may be nonpersonally identifiable, such as your IP address.

CorePower Yoga has provided this Policy so that you will know what information CorePower Yoga collects, how CorePower Yoga uses this information, the types of third parties with whom CorePower Yoga may share this information, and some of the choices that are available to you.

**Your Consent**  
By using this Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of your information as described in this Policy. If you do not consent to the collection, use, disclosure and transfer of your information as described in this Policy, you may not use this Site. If you have questions about this Policy, please contact us by phone at 866-441-YOGA (9642).

**Our Terms of Use**  
This Policy is part of the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-use) that govern your use of this Site. A link to our Terms of Use is provided at the bottom of each page of this Site.

**Your Choices**

This Policy describes some of your choices, such as your choice to opt out of receiving “cookies.” We may ask you to indicate your choices at the time and on the page where you provide your information.

_Do Not Track Mechanisms_. California law requires this Policy to address how we respond to any “Do-Not-Track (‘DNT’) signal” delivered by your browser. Because of the changing state of technology and indecision within the industry regarding the meaning of DNT signals, we currently do not make any guarantee that we will honor DNT signals.

_Previously Expressed Preferences._ You may change previously expressed preferences regarding how we use your information. You may be able to change preferences through your account. Otherwise, please contact us using the information provided below. You may opt out of promotional emails by clicking the unsubscribe link in the footer of any promotional email we send you.

**This Policy May Change**  
CorePower Yoga reserves the right to update or modify this Policy, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version of the Policy on this Site. These changes will only apply to the information we collect after we have posted the revised Policy on this Site.

Your use of this Site following any such change constitutes your agreement that all information collected from or about you after the revised Policy is posted will be subject to the terms of the revised Policy. You may access the current version of this Policy at any time by clicking on the link marked “Privacy” at the bottom of each page of the public areas of this Site.

_Information From Third-Party Social Media Platforms._ You may be able to register with, log on to, or enhance your profile on this Site by choosing to automatically populate the requested data fields with information you previously provided to a third-party social media platform (such as Facebook or Twitter).

The information we receive from your web browser and device is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable. Generally, we use this information in the aggregate to help us improve this Site and make it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors. However, we may combine it with other information in an attempt to identify you or we may combine it with information that does identify you. We may also review our server logs for security purposes—for example, to detect intrusions into our network—and we might share our server logs, which contain visitors’ IP addresses, with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify you.
