 **(b)             ****Automated Collection**  
CFI may automatically collect certain information regarding your use of CFI’s websites, such as the dates and times that you use the websites, the browsers, operating systems, software and devices that you use to access the websites and details of your use of the websites.

CFI’s websites, email messages and advertisements may use technologies (e.g. cookies, web beacons, tokens, pixels or tags) to collect information that assists CFI to improve its products, services, customer communications and advertising and to prevent fraud. CFI may use information collected through technological means to recognize you as a user of CFI’s websites, to facilitate and improve your use of CFI’s websites, to confirm that messages have been delivered to and opened by you and to provide you with targeted advertisements. You may choose to decline or disable cookies if your web browser or device permits, but doing so may affect your ability to access or use certain features of a website. More information about cookies used for interest-based advertising is set out in section 4(c) below.

Some of the information automatically collected by technological means is non-personal information (because the information does not identify you), and CFI will deal with that non-personal information as explained below in this Privacy Policy unless applicable law requires otherwise.

 **(c)             ****Cookies**  
Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the website’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we may use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart and to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We may also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. You can find out more about how to manage cookies here: www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies.

We use cookies to:

  * help remember and process the items in the shopping cart;
  * understand and save user’s preferences for future visits;
  * keep track of advertisements; and
  * compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.



You may choose to decline or disable cookies if your web browser permits, but doing so may affect your ability to access or use certain features of CFI’s websites. However, you will still be able to place orders.

 **(d)             ****Internet-Based Advertising**  
CFI may use interest-based advertising services (sometimes called “remarketing” or “retargeting”) provided by third party vendors (such as Google, Bing, LinkedIn and Facebook) to display advertisements on third party websites and social media sites visited by users of a CFI website. Advertising vendors (such as Google, Bing, LinkedIn and Facebook) use cookies, pixels or tokens – unique identifiers of a web browser on a specific computer that are installed on the computer when it accesses CFI websites – to display ads based on the computer’s past access to CFI websites. You can opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting Google’s Ads Settings. You can also opt out of a remarketing vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s consumer opt-out page.

 **(e)             ****Information from Other Sources**  
CFI may collect personal information from various publicly available sources and other third parties that are lawfully entitled to share your personal information with CFI.

CFI may combine your personal information collected by CFI through various sources.

A legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your personal information, so long as this is not overridden by your own rights and interests.

  * pursuit of our commercial activities and objectives, or those of a third party;
  * compliance with applicable legal and regulatory obligations and any codes of conduct;

 **10.            Your California Privacy Rights**  
California law permits California residents who provide us with personal information to request certain information regarding our disclosure of such information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

Third parties, other than our vendors (such as our website analytics provider), do not have authorization from us to track which websites you visited prior to and after visiting our website. That said, we cannot control third party tracking and there may be some third party tracking that occurs without our knowledge or consent.

 **12.            Protection of Personal Information**  
CFI uses reasonable safeguards – including administrative, physical and technical security and safeguarding measures – appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal information in CFI’s possession or under CFI’s control to help protect the information from unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, deletion or similar risks.

Right to rectify your personal information| You have the right to ask us to correct your personal information that we hold where it is incorrect or incomplete.  
Right to erasure of your personal information:| You have the right to ask that your personal information be deleted in certain circumstances.  For example (i) where your personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise used; (ii) if you withdraw your consent and there is no other legal ground for which we rely on for the continued use of your personal information; (iii) if you object to the use of your personal information (as set out below); (iv) if we have used your personal information unlawfully; or (v) if your personal information needs to be erased to comply with a legal obligation.

 **14.            Non-Personal Information**  
CFI may use personal information to create and collect non-personal information (information that is not about an identifiable individual), including personal information that has been aggregated or otherwise depersonalized so that the information no longer relates to an identifiable individual. CFI may use, disclose, transfer and retain non-personal information for any purpose and in any manner whatsoever. If non-personal information is combined with personal information, then CFI will treat the combined non-personal information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy for as long as the non-personal information is combined with your personal information.

 **15.            Other Websites and Businesses**  
CFI’s websites and correspondence (including emails and messages) may include advertisements for products and services offered by independent businesses or links to websites operated by independent businesses. CFI has no responsibility or liability for, or control over, those other websites, online services or businesses, their products or services, or their collection, use, disclosure or retention of your personal information.

When you use certain aspects of CFI’s websites or other services, or post information to other social networking sites (e.g. there may be links to CFI’s Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn or Google+ pages or you may be able to “like” a product on your Facebook account or “pin” a product on your Pinterest account), the personal information that you post or share in connection with these third party sites is visible to other persons and can be read, collected, used and disclosed by other persons, including to send unsolicited messages. As will be evident, in such a case, you will be leaving a CFI website and going to the third party’s website. Any information provided to such third party social networking sites and other sites is governed by their own privacy policies, which you may read on the applicable site. You are solely responsible for the personal information that you choose to post or share in those situations. CFI has no control over, or responsibility or liability for, the use, disclosure and retention of the personal information that you disclose in those situations, and the use, disclosure and retention of the disclosed information is not subject to this Privacy Policy.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of those provisions applies to any dispute that may arise in relation to this Privacy Policy or CFI’s collection, use, disclosure and retention of your personal information, and are of the same force and effect as if they were reproduced directly in this Privacy Policy. Nothing in this Privacy Policy amends any of those other agreements.

 **(b)             ****Changes to this Policy:**   CFI may change this Privacy Policy as it applies to CFI from time to time by posting a new version of this Privacy Policy on CFI’s websites. CFI’s collection, use, disclosure and retention of your personal information will be governed by the version of this Privacy Policy in effect at that time.
