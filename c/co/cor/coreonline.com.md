**Data protection compliance**

This Site is controlled by us from our offices in the United Kingdom (“ **UK** ”). Personal information collected from the Site is processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “ **Act** "), which regulates the processing of personal data in the UK. We are registered as a data controller in accordance with the Act and comply with UK data protection and privacy law. 

If you choose to visit the Site from outside the UK, you do so at your own risk, with the understanding that personal information collected from the Site may be collected, stored and used in a country whose privacy laws may be different and less protective than those of your home country. 

**The information we collect from you**

When you use the Site (such as when registering as a member and/or using our paid-for services), we may ask you to provide us with personal information that identifies you personally (including “personal data” and “sensitive personal data”, as defined in the Act). This may include your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, fax number, gender, date of birth, country and/or preferred language. From time to time, you may be asked to submit personal information in order to receive or use services on the Site or for the purposes further described in this Privacy Policy. By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable us to provide you with the services you select. If you do not provide us with all or part of the personal information requested, some services on the Site may not be available to you. 

Whenever you provide such personal information, we will treat that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

You may decide to make certain information available for other users of our services to see (for example, in the course of playing an online game). In this context, you should only provide information that you are entirely comfortable with providing, and we strongly recommend that you do not provide any details that could be used to make personal contact with you. 

We may also collect certain anonymous usage data, such as pages visited and services used within the Site. This information is not personally identifiable information and generally is not aggregated with your personal information. We generally use usage data to improve our services to you and to customise and enhance your experience of the Site. 

**An important note to parents or guardians**

We encourage parents or guardians to take an active interest in their children's use of the internet and the Site. Parents or guardians should be aware that there are software tools available online that screens objectionable content and allows you to prevent children from disclosing their personal information without your permission.

Children under the age of 13 can participate in all activities on the Site that do not require submission of personal information. They may view, but may not under any circumstances participate in activities that require submission of personal information, such as message boards, contests or sweepstakes. 

In addition we take particular care when processing the personal information of children aged 13 or older to ensure that such information is processed in accordance with the Act.

We may collect and process information about your computer, including (where available) your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration. This comprises statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. 

We may, however, link IP addresses to personal data (such as a user’s country) and/or non-personal data (such as a user’s access location or usage record) in order to enforce our _Terms of Use_ or other user contracts, and we may block certain IP addresses from accessing all or any part of the Site in the event of a user abuse. In particular, our Japanese affiliate may use automated tracking tools to prevent or stop users from engaging in fraudulent activities or unauthorised uses of the Site (such as unauthorised commercial use of items obtained via game play).

**Where we store your personal information**

All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers hosted by us or third parties providing hosting, payment or other services for us. 

The information we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (" **EEA** "), including any destination where the privacy laws of the country concerned may be different and less protective than those of EEA countries. It may also be processed by personnel operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such personnel may be engaged in, among other things, the processing of your payment details (where applicable) and the provision of support services. 

By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing and processing.

We ask you not to share a password with anyone. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. You acknowledge and accept that others may intercept the personal information you provide to us, and that any such transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. 

One easy and important way to protect your personal information is to keep your account password confidential and to close your browser when you are away from your computer.
