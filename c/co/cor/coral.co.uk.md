7.2 By accepting this Privacy Policy, You authorise Us, Our staff, affiliates, subsidiaries, agents and suppliers to both use Your personal information and to disclose Your personal information to third parties with the objective of validating the supplied information. This includes where necessary the transfer of information outside of Your country, including to countries whose privacy laws may not be regarded as acceptable.

8.1 Information security is important to Us and We understand the techniques required to secure this information. Security measures are in place to protect Your information from access by unauthorised persons and to prevent unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. 

8.2 Data on Our secure pages is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology. Personal information received directly from You will be stored in a password-protected database located within Our secure network behind active state of the art firewall software. 

8.3 Unfortunately the sending of information via the internet cannot be completely secure at all times.

8.4 The Service operates "AS-IS" and "AS-AVAILABLE," without liability of any kind. Whilst We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the safety of Your personal information, due to the continually evolving state of technology and business, coupled with its complexity, We are not able to guarantee error free performance in relation to the privacy of Your personal information. 

8.5 Protection of any information or images provided to a third-party online site that links to or from the service, cannot be guaranteed. This includes information collected by any third party managing Our affiliate program or any other program, as these third-party online sites are owned and operated independently of Us. 

8.6 Information gathered by these third parties will fall under their privacy policy rather than ours. If You have any queries regarding a third party's privacy policy, You can obtain this information directly from them. 

8.7 We are not responsible or liable for: 

  * the actions or policies of these third parties; or 
  * the content or privacy practices of these online sites.
