<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>Cornwall County Council ("the Council") is committed to preserving the 
privacy of all visitors to the <a href="http://www.cornwall.gov.uk">
www.cornwall.gov.uk</a>&nbsp; website ("the Website").&nbsp; This policy is provided 
to inform you how we collect, use and protect the information that you provide 
to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Council will ensure that any information it receives will be processed in 
accordance with the principles contained in the Data Protection Act 1998 and the 
policy detailed below.&nbsp; This policy only covers the Website and does not cover 
any third party websites to which links are provided.</p>
<h2>1.&nbsp;Information that the Council collects from you&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>1.1&nbsp;The Council collects information from you in the following ways:</h3>
<h4>&nbsp;1.1.1&nbsp;Information that you provide to the Council</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The Website contains feedback forms and questionnaires, which you can &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
complete and return if you wish.&nbsp; The forms may ask for your name and contact 
details (eg address, telephone number, email address etc). If you &nbsp;choose to 
complete a questionnaire then you may be asked to provide information on a 
variety of topics and it is at your discretion, if you choose to &nbsp;do so.&nbsp; The 
forms will contain notices letting you know why the Council is requesting the 
information.</p>
<p>You may make an information request and in order to receive a response to 
your question, you may disclose personal information to the Council.&nbsp; The 
Council may also collect information about you from messages you post to the 
Website and emails or letters you send to us.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordering goods and Services</h4>
<p>On the Website you can order goods and services and you will be asked to 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide contact details and debit/credit card details in order to make 
a purchase.</p>
<h2>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of your Information</h2>
<p>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Your information will allow the Council to process and supply any orders 
for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goods and services.&nbsp; It will also enable us to bill you and 
contact you where &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary regarding any order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council may use your information to contact you regarding a request

sold, rented or &nbsp; leased without your prior written consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>2.6 If you have ordered goods or services, the Council may have to 
give&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information to agents or subcontractors in order to process and 
deliver your order.&nbsp; If this was necessary, the Council would ensure that agents 
or subcontractors are aware of the obligations in the Data Protection Act 1998 
and this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.7 In the event that the Council transfers management of the Website to a 
third &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; party, you agree that your information can be transferred to that 
third party. The Council will ensure that any third party taking over management

and this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>2.8 The Council will only retain your personal information for as long as 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary to fulfil the purpose(s) for which it was collected.&nbsp; Once

and disposed of in accordance in a secure manner.&nbsp;</p>
