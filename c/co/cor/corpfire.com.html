			 When you register with us, sign up for an application or service, become a member of a company profile or make recommendations on the service, we use certain information we collect from you (your name, business, and location of your business) to set up a profile on your behalf to share with others, and which information will be available by search to help you promote your business or profession. After you register with CorpFire, you may provide additional member information about yourself (member profile, company profile) and add company profile information/pictures about your business in the My Profile/Members Home area on CorpFire.

			<br>
