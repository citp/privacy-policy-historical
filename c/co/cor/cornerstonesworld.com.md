At CornerstonesWorld.com, we are committed to protecting your right to privacy. Any information submitted by you will be used solely for the purpose of completing the transaction, delivering the product to you or your clients and addressing any customer service issues. We have taken countless measures to block and disable various methods Internet fraud companies use. For instance all financial transactions (which contain most of your personal details) take place on the payment website PayPal (<http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/security-outside>) equipped with a powerful SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connection that encrypts your data on its way through the Internet between you and the bank - even if it were to be intercepted on the way, it would be useless to any unscrupulous character. The SSL protocol maintains the security and integrity of the transmission channel by using encryption, authentication and message authentication codes using public and private key combinations, read more here: <http://www.verisign.com/ssl/ssl-information-center/how-ssl-security-works/index.html> and here:
