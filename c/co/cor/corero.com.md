Service providers, Cloud/hosting providers and digital enterprises rely on Corero’s award winning SmartWall technology to eliminate the DDoS threat to their environment through automatic attack detection and mitigation, coupled with complete network visibility, analytics and reporting. 

**Who this Policy applies to**  
From time to time, as part of running our business, we collect and use certain personal information about individuals who we interact with, in relation to the provision of our software products and services (we refer to such individuals in this Policy as “ **contacts** ” or “ **individuals** ” or “ **you** ”).

This Policy applies to individuals whose personal information we collect. You may be located in the UK, Europe, America, or indeed worldwide. Depending on your geographical location and which of our Corero entities handle your personal information, certain parts of this Policy apply.

**Transfers to** **Salesforce** – as mentioned above, we use a third-party IT provider, called Salesforce, to provide a cloud based CRM solution. Salesforce store personal information on servers based in the United States, which involves us transferring personal information outside of the EEA, to the US. In these circumstances the personal information will be transferred to and stored by Salesforce in accordance with the EU-US Privacy Shield, which has been approved by the European Commission as offering adequate levels of protection for personal information and therefore complies with UK data protection law. You can find more information about Salesforce's certification with Privacy Shield at: [https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000KzLyAAK&status=Active](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000KzLyAAK&status=Active)

  8. ### **How we legally justify using your personal information**




Every use that we make of your personal information must meet a legal ground in the list set out by UK data protection law. The grounds which we rely upon are as follows:

**Marketing** – in relation to marketing activity which we perform using your personal information, we rely on the following conditions:

  1. **For marketing to corporate subscriber customers / potential customers** – the vast majority of the marketing activity which we undertake is to customers/potential customers who are corporate bodies or companies. For marketing to people who work for such customers, we rely on the condition that such marketing is necessary for us to achieve our legitimate interests, where your rights and freedoms are not jeopardised so as to override this legitimate interest. Our legitimate interests are to inform organisations about the products and services which we can offer, enhancements to the same and informing organisations about forthcoming events and special offers. 


  2. **For marketing to customers / potential customers who are sole traders or partnerships** \- on very rare occasions we may also market to people who work for sole traders or partnerships. In such circumstances, we will only send you marketing communications where we have received your prior consent to our doing so. If you withdraw your consent to receive marketing information at any time we will cease sending you any more marketing information.



For any marketing activity, you have the right to object to receiving further direct marketing information and if you do so, we will cease sending you any more marketing information. However, we will keep minimal personal information about you on a screening list, to ensure that we do not accidentally send you marketing information against your wishes in the future. 

**Day to day communications and managing existing relationships** \- the legal ground which is relevant to us processing your personal information for such purposes (for customers, suppliers, partners and website users) is that such processing is necessary for us to achieve our legitimate interests, and where your rights and freedoms are not jeopardised so as to override this legitimate interest. Our legitimate interests are ensuring that we can communicate effectively with the relevant personnel at such parties, in order for us to provide our products and services in a timely and professional manner, and to honour our contractual and other obligations to the parties who we work with. 

**Sharing personal information with Corero US** \- the legal ground which is relevant to us sharing your personal information with Corero US is that such sharing is necessary for us to achieve our legitimate interests, and where your rights and freedoms are not jeopardised so as to override this legitimate interest. The particular legitimate interests in this case is that Corero US controls our marketing activities and therefore require access to contact details of individuals who work at organisations to whom we wish to market our products and services. 

  9. ### **Your legal rights in relation to your personal information**




If you have any questions in relation to our use of your personal information, you should first contact us using the contact details in paragraph 5 above. Under certain conditions, you may have the right to require us to:

  1. provide you with further details on the use we make of your personal information and/or transfer a copy of your personal information to another data controller;
  2. provide you with an electronic copy of personal information that we hold;
  3. update any inaccuracies in the personal information we hold and/or restrict processing of your personal information;
  4. delete any personal information that we no longer have a lawful ground to use;
  5. object to our use of your personal information which is based on the 'legitimate interests' legal ground. If our use of your personal information based only on this legal ground is causing you undue harm, then we must cease using your personal information for that purpose.



You also have the right to object to receiving direct marketing communications from us (which we will promptly comply with) and where any other use of your personal information is based on consent, to withdraw that consent at any time. 

Your exercise of most of these rights is subject to certain conditions and exemptions, for example to safeguard the public interest in investigating crimes, or protecting legal privilege. If you exercise any of these rights we will check your entitlement and respond in most cases within a month. 

If you are not satisfied with our use of your personal information or our response to you, you can complain to the contact listed at paragraph 5 above. You also have the right to complain to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) at any time.
