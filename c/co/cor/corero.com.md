# Privacy Policy

We regard our visitors' privacy as one of our most important values. To protect your personal information, we will limit its collection and use to what is necessary to administer our business, provide you with the highest quality service, and continue to offer you information and opportunities we think will be of interest.  **We will not disclose any individual information to other organizations**.

The company web site contains links to other sites. While we make every effort to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.

Should you have any questions about the company's Privacy Policy, please e-mail us here: [info@corero.com](mailto:info@corero.com).

### General Statement 

The company collects personal information from our visitors for three primary purposes:

  1. To send/process the information you request quickly and accurately.
  2. To help us create web site content most relevant to you.
  3. To alert you to new products and services offered by the company.



**We do not sell, rent, or transmit personal information to other organizations.**

### Collection and Use 

Our web server tracks and collects general information about the visits to our web site. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our site, the daily requests we receive for particular web pages, the types of browsers visitors use, the visitors' domain names, etc.

The data you provide helps us to customize our web site to better meet your needs. The company may also retain electronic communications you send to our employees. These may be shared only within the company as a means to continually improve customer service.

### Storage and Access

All personal information you provide to the company is secured on our server with restricted access. The company reserves the right to use agents, who are bound by strict confidentiality guidelines, to perform storage and processing functions. Only designated employees or agents who need to carry out legitimate business functions are permitted to view your personal data. Employees or agents who violate the company's Privacy Policy are subject to disciplinary actions, up to and including termination.

### Disclosure 

Because the company considers the individual information we maintain to be confidential, our policy is to disclose no personal information to third parties unless release is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or government investigations or proceedings.
