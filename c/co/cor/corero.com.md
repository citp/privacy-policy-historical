# Corero - Company - The Corero Difference - Privacy Policy

We regard our visitors' privacy as one of our most important values. To protect your personal information, we will limit its collection and use to what is necessary to administer our business, provide you with the highest quality service, and continue to offer you information and opportunities we think will be of interest.  **We will not disclose any individual information to other organizations**.

The company web site contains links to other sites. While we make every effort to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.

  1. To send/process the information you request quickly and accurately.
  2. To help us create web site content most relevant to you.
  3. To alert you to new products and services offered by the company.



**We do not sell, rent, or transmit personal information to other organizations.**
