## Collection of information

You are free to browse the Site without revealing any personal information making it possible to identify you. However, once you have sent us your identifiable personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. 

We collect two types of information from Users of the Site: "Automatic Anonymous Information" (AAI) and "Identifiable Personal Information" (IPI). We process AAI and IPI differently, and the following articles describe both AAI and IPI and indicate how each type of information is collected and used by Cornbit. 

The Site make it possible to monitor certain information automatically, based on your behaviour. This information does not identify you personally. We use this information to improve the Content and functionality of the Site, and to better understand and satisfy our visitors. This information may include the browser you use, your IP address or other information. This information is referred to herein as the AAI. 

IPI is individually identifiable information about you that allows us to identify or contact you. Some of the Site's functions require asking you for certain IPI, such as your instagram username, instagram password and/or other personal information. 

But we do not handle your Instagram passwords directly. We use Instagram's API and OAuth protocol to authorize Our users. Our databases are secured with passwords to guard against unauthorized access of Our systems. Only engineer staff members may access data on a need-to-know basis. 

You may choose to provide IPI in order to access certain functions on the Site. You can always choose not to provide certain information, but in that case it may be that you cannot use certain of the Site's functions.
