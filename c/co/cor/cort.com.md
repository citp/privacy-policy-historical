EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield

CORT Business Services Corporation participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. We are committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List. [[https://www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/)]

CORT Business Services Corporation is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. CORT Business Services Corporation complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, CORT Business Services Corporation is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

1\. The Information We Collect.

We collect and maintain different types of personal information that you and/or your employer provide to us on a voluntary basis. This may include:

• Personal information such as given name(s), preferred name(s), gender, marital status;  
• family information such as names and contact details of spouses and dependents;  
• contact information such as address, telephone/mobile number, email address; employment information such as role/title, name of current employer, work address, work telephone, work email address, fax number;

• business relationship information, including information related to your agreements, preferences, advisors and decision-makers, feed-back and information requested by or provided to you.

If you email us a question or request, we may use your email address to process your request and respond to your question.

2\. How We Collect Personal Information

In order to provide relocation services, CORT receives information about you from your employer, and collects information directly from you for that purpose. In addition to this direct contact with you and your employer, CORT also collects information through the following methods:

CORT Websites

Throughout our websites, we have provided Site visitors various forms from which they can request additional information about CORT products and services, or from which they can request to speak with a CORT customer service representative. On these forms, visitors are prompted to provide their names, contact information and, in some cases, other personally identifiable information pertinent to the request.

We also collect information about the nature of your use of the Site. We collect this information and use it in the aggregate to monitor the Site, to improve Site offerings and for targeted promotional or marketing initiatives. Aggregated data are compiled into statistical and demographic information that we use, and may share with others, to show preferences of Site users in the aggregate, but not the preferences of any individual users. If we share this kind of aggregated data with third parties, it will not include a level of detail that would permit a third party to associate an individual user with the user's usage or preferences. We may combine autonomous information with personally identifiable information to identify a user in order to enforce the Website Terms & Conditions.

We collect your location based information for the purpose of locating a place that you may be searching for in your area. We will only share this information with our mapping provider for the sole purpose of providing you this service. You may opt-out of location based services at any time by emailing us at [nocontact@cort.com](mailto:nocontact@cort.com)

Other Sources

We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, and combine this data with information we already have about you. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us. If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your personal information and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact us at [PrivacyQA@cort.com](mailto:PrivacyQA@cort.com) and include the CORT domain at issue.

Examples of the types of personal information that may be obtained from public sources or purchased from third parties and combined with information we already have about you, may include: Company, Occupation, Job Title, Mailing Address.

3\. How We Use the Information We Collect

We use the personally identifiable information we collect on the Site to ensure compliance with the website Terms & Conditions, to offer and render our services and to respond to our users' queries. We also use personal information from you to enable us to manage, maintain, and develop our business and operations, including:

• to establish, maintain and manage our relationship with you so that we can provide the programs, products and services that have been requested;  
• to be able to review the products and services that we provide to you so that we may understand your requirements for our programs, products and services and so that we may work to improve our products and services;  
• to administer or otherwise carry out our obligations in relation to any agreement you or your employer have with us;  
• to protect us against error, breach of contract, negligence, fraud, theft, illegal activity and damage to our goods and property;  
• to alert you to updated information and other new products and services from us, or third-parties, or to forward promotional materials to you, where you have consented to receive such information;  
• to complete a transaction or service requested by you or your employer;  
• to respond to inquiries or requests submitted by you or your employer;  
• to ensure the Sites are relevant to your needs;  
• to help us create and publish content most relevant to you;  
• to enable us to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements; and  
• any other reasonable purpose to which you consent.

Personally identifiable information is accessible by our employees, contractors and agents to the extent reasonably necessary for these purposes.
