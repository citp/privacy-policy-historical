In order to take full advantage of some of our services, certain tools, such as the [plan your visit tool](http://www.cornell.edu/visit/), the [university events calendar](http://events.cornell.edu/) and [events emailer](https://www.cornell.edu/events-emailer/), and the [CornellCast video library](http://www.cornell.edu/video/) may request additional contact information and/or online identifiers (ex. supplied username or NetID). 

## How we use your information

Your email address will only be used for communicating with you about the live broadcast. Additionally, you may provide your email address during a live broadcast to ask or receive follow up to questions that were not addressed during the broadcast. 

## With whom we share your information

Information we gather may also be shared with campus constituents to improve programs, outreach, and other campus initiatives.
