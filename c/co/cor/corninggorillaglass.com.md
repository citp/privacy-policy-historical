The approval of Corning’s BCRs was led by the French supervisory authority, the CNIL, with secondary input from the German state of Hessen and Poland’s supervisory authorities.

Corning will make reasonable efforts to publish any such changes in this notice, such as posting on this website. You should review this notice periodically to stay informed of any changes.
