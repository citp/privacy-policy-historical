<p>Our Web site registration form(s) may require customers to give us specific contact information (such as name and e-mail address), unique company information (such as employee ID, department name, business unit, etc) and demographic information (such as gender, ethnicity, zip code, etc).  The extent of information collected depends on unique contractual agreements with our client organizations.
