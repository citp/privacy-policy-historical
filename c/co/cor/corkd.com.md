# Cork'd | Privacy Policy

At the same time that Tundro Corporation (Tundro) is committed to bringing you information tailored to your individual needs, we recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about you, our customers and prospects. In adopting this customer privacy policy, our intent is to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting and using information with your reasonable expectations of privacy. Tundro collects personally identifying information in order to provide its recommendation services and for site logins, etc.

Web servers serving Tundro automatically collect information about which pages each user visits and the domain name of visitors. This is used for internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for traffic audits. We also provide this information (as well as information from third-party market researchers) about our users on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our advertisers. Any personally identifiable information provided by subscribers online as part of an advertiser promotion online (i.e. online coupons) may be provided directly to advertisers.

Tundro may place a “cookie” on the browser of a Tundro user’s computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information. A cookie can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a Web site; we use the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as delivery of ads, so we can customize delivery of information without compromising privacy. For example, cookies are used to ensure that you don’t see the same ad too many times in a single session.

A user’s personally identifiable information (e.g., name, e-mail address) may be used by Tundro for marketing and promotional purposes. We may send you e-mails about Tundro products, promotions, or services as well as on behalf of other companies. This means that Tundro may use your individually identifiable information to market new products or services to you that we think will be of interest to you, but we will not disclose your individually identifiable information to third parties who want to market products to you.

Except as stated in this privacy policy or at the time of collection, user’s personally identifiable information, will not be transferred to a party outside Tundro, its divisions, its vendors providing Internet hosting services or third party list managers unless stated at the time of collection. If you do not wish to receive any e-mail or to have us share such information with another party, you may “opt out” at any time by editing the contact settings on your Account page.

We do not control the privacy policies of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors or other sites to which we provide hyperlinks. Tundro users should also be aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas or bulletin boards, that information may be collected by others and may result in unsolicited messages from others.

Tundro and/or this website may be sold at a future date and time. Tundro is not able to guarantee how an acquiring company may chose to use the information obtained as part of that acquisition.

Parents: We encourage you to get involved with your children’s online usage and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. If you discover that your children or minors under your care have created an account, please contact us and we will delete/disable the underage user’s account.

Technology on the Internet is developing at a rapid pace, and we need to maintain our flexibility in the online arena. If we need to change our policy in the future, we will post these changes as soon as they go into effect.
