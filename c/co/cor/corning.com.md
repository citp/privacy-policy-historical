Corning protects your privacy on Corning.com and related Corning websites through these basic principles:

**1.     **You will be advised when Corning is collecting information about you or your online preferences and expectations and it will be made clear how that information is to be used.  In general, information collected such as names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, etc. will only be used by Corning to respond to inquiries, manage user established online accounts, or for specific Corning marketing activities, events or services. Other than information collected through essential cookies (as described in Corning’s **[Cookies Policy](http://www.corning.com/worldwide/en/cookies.html)** ), you will be able to choose whether or not you want to provide such information. If you choose not to provide some information, please be aware that it may not be possible for you to proceed with your chosen business activity with Corning.

**2.     **Corning reserves the right to retain electronic communications sent by visitors. Further, Corning uses an SMTP gateway to forward e-mail and to log e-mail transactions. Logs of e-mail transactions include:  date and time of message; name and IP address of connecting host; e-mail address of message originator; and Corning address of recipient.

**3.     **Any information collected about you will be kept secure and not shared with third parties, with the exception of Corning affiliates or service providers, unless you give prior permission for that information to be shared.  However, Corning may have to disclose personal data it considers necessary in order to comply with court orders, subpoenas, governmental or law enforcement requests, or to a third party to which ownership of Corning or a Corning subsidiary is transferred via an acquisition, merger, sale of assets, etc.  Corning reserves the right to transfer information you provide to other countries in order to share such information with Corning affiliates or service providers. We maintain safeguards reasonably intended to protect your personal data from unauthorized or inappropriate access.

**4.     **When providing personal data to us in order to initiate a credit card transaction, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your online order information. When you enter this information on one of our websites, your personal data and credit card information is encrypted and sent directly to a credit card processor for verification and processing. 

**5.     **As part of its global data privacy management program, Corning maintains processes intended to allow individuals to request access to, correct, or erase personal data that Corning maintains related to such individuals. To submit such requests, please contact us at [privacy@corning.com](mailto:privacy@corning.com) or at the mailing address listed below. Be sure to include your name and clear instructions regarding any change to your personal data or request to delete you from our database, and Corning will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete your request.  In the event you choose to delete your personal data from our database, we may retain a record of such information as well as your request for deletion as evidence of our compliance with this privacy statement.
