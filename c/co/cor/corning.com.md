# Privacy Policy | Corning.com

Corning Incorporated (“Corning,” “we,” “us,” “our”) is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. How your personal data will be treated during your use of Corning’s websites is outlined below.

Corning has implemented a set of **[Binding Corporate Rules](https://web.archive.org/worldwide/en/privacy-policy/binding-corporate-rules.html)** (“BCRs”) to establish safeguards to ensure that personal data is protected while transferred within the Corning group. The implementation of BCRs provides an adequate level of protection for the personal data transfers carried out from the Corning European Economic Area (EEA) entities to the other Corning entities located in non-EEA countries throughout the world. The approval of Corning’s BCRs was led by the French data protection authority, the CNIL, with secondary input from the German state of Hessen and Poland’s data protection authorities.

From time to time, we may make changes to this privacy notice to reflect changes in our business or to serve you better. Corning will make reasonable efforts to publish any such changes in the privacy notice, such as posting on this website. You should review this notice periodically to stay informed of any changes. Please note the date of the notice below, so that you know when it was last updated.

Corning protects your privacy on Corning.com and related Corning websites through these basic principles:

**1.   **You will be advised when Corning is collecting information about you or your online preferences and expectations and it will be made clear how that information is to be used.  In general, information collected such as names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, etc. will only be used by Corning to respond to inquiries, manage user established online accounts, or for specific Corning marketing activities, events, or services. Other than information collected through essential cookies (as described in Corning’s **[Cookies Policy](http://www.corning.com/worldwide/en/cookies.html)** ), you will be able to choose whether or not you want to provide such information. If you choose not to provide some information, please be aware that it may not be possible for you to proceed with your chosen business activity with Corning.

**2.   **Corning reserves the right to retain electronic communications sent by visitors. Further, Corning uses an SMTP gateway to forward e-mail and to log e-mail transactions. Logs of e-mail transactions include: date and time of message; name and IP address of connecting host; e-mail address of message originator; and Corning address of recipient.

**3.     **Any information collected about you will be kept secure and not shared with third parties, with the exception of Corning affiliates or service providers, unless you give prior permission for that information to be shared.  However, Corning may have to disclose personal data it considers necessary in order to comply with court orders, subpoenas, governmental or law enforcement requests, or to a third party to which ownership of Corning or a Corning subsidiary is transferred via an acquisition, merger, sale of assets, etc.  Corning reserves the right to transfer information you provide to other countries in order to share such information with Corning affiliates or service providers. We maintain safeguards reasonably intended to protect your personal data from unauthorized or inappropriate access.

**4.     **When providing personal data to us in order to initiate a credit card transaction, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your online order information. When you enter this information on one of our websites, your personal data and credit card information is encrypted and sent directly to a credit card processor for verification and processing. 

**5.     **As part of its global data privacy management program, Corning maintains processes intended to allow individuals to request access to, correct, or erase personal data that Corning maintains related to such individuals. To submit such requests, please contact us at [privacy@corning.com](mailto:privacy@corning.com) or at the mailing address listed below. Be sure to include your name and clear instructions regarding any change to your personal data or request to delete your information from our database, and Corning will make reasonable efforts to complete your request.  In the event you choose to delete or thoroughly anonymize your personal data from our database, we may retain a record of your deletion request as well as records indicating the type of information deleted as evidence of our compliance with this privacy statement.
