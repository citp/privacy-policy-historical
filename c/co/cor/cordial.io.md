CORDIAL does not sell, rent, or trade the personal information of any of our customers to any third party. Please review our policy and contact us with any questions.

## Collection of Personal Information

When you use or access the CORDIAL Services, you share certain personal information with CORDIAL. When you register with us, you may provide us with personally identifying information. Your decision to provide such information is voluntary. We collect this information in order to best respond to your use of our Services. If you choose not to share this information with us, it may not be possible for us to respond to your request.

Our registration form collects such items as name, email address, and telephone number, as well as information on the subjects for which you are requesting a tutor.

Should you choose to provide us with your telephone number or email address you may receive telephone, mail, or email contact from us with information regarding our products or services, special promotions, or upcoming events. You will be provided with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such information in the future.

We may disclose personally identifying information in cases in which we have reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact, restrain, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with CORDIAL, our property, customers, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities, and in cases in which we believe in good faith that the law requires us to do so.

Your personal information is used by us for billing purposes, assessments of and provision of services to users; communication with you; and internal auditing.  We may also use the information that we collect to confirm that you are authorized to use the Services and to fulfill a requested transaction, including the processing of payments.

For service activities that request personal information, you agree to provide accurate and current information about yourself. Your registration and/or participation in our Services may be canceled without notice if at any time we discover that you provide false information, or violate any term of this Privacy Policy or our AUP.

CORDIAL will not disclose any of your personal information, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to cooperate with local, state and/or federal law enforcement authorities, to enforce the AUP or prevent unauthorized use of the Services to respond to claims that any content in the Services violates the rights of third parties, protect the rights, property, or personal safety of CORDIAL, its users, or the public.

CORDIAL relies on feedback from users regarding the Services provided. CORDIAL reserves the right to replicate your written comments about the service sent to our representatives via our website or the Services in promotional materials and/or in business development materials, along with your first name and company. Your email address and any personal information besides your name and company will not be used at any time without your agreement.  If you would like to make your comments anonymous, you may designate them as such in the Application.

We reserve the right to update our privacy and security policies and practices from time to time at our sole discretion. We will employ important safeguards against unauthorized disclosure or access to your personal information or other personally identifiable information about you, consistent with our Privacy Policy. HOWEVER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SECURITY SAFEGUARDS, BY THEIR NATURE, ARE CAPABLE OF CIRCUMVENTION AND WE DO NOT AND CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU WILL NOT BE ACCESSED BY UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS CAPABLE OF OVERCOMING SUCH SAFEGUARDS. IN PARTICULAR, OUR WEBSITE MAY BE USED TO ACCESS AND TRANSFER INFORMATION, INCLUDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU OVER THE INTERNET. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE DO NOT OPERATE OR CONTROL THE INTERNET AND THAT UNAUTHORIZED USERS MAY USE VIRUSES, WORMS, TROJAN HORSES, AND OTHER DATA AND SOFTWARE TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO OR DAMAGE OUR WEBSITE OR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU.
