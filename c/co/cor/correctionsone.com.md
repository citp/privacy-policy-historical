# Privacy Policy

**What personally identifiable information does CorrectionsOne collect from me?**

CorrectionsOne collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of web sites. 

Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, CorrectionsOne asks all users for your name, email address, address, zip code, occupation, industry and personal interests. To confirm the identity of Corrections officials, we also ask for agency information. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to CorrectionsOne - you are given a CorrectionsOne ID and are able to take full advantage of CorrectionsOne's many offerings. 

In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by CorrectionsOne and/or our many partners; when you make a purchase through CorrectionsOne or one of our partners; when you post a CorrectionsOne Classified ad; when you submit a listing for a web site; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact CorrectionsOne we may keep a record of that correspondence. CorrectionsOne also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever CorrectionsOne collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.

**What are cookies and how does CorrectionsOne use them?**

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, CorrectionsOne uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sites on CorrectionsOne where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable require that you accept 

_Generally, we use cookies to:_

  * (1) Remind us of whom you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In" and is modified when you "Sign Out" of our services. CorrectionsOne also uses cookies to store your zip code for other services, such as Yellow Pages. 
  * (2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing CorrectionsOne is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior. 
  * (3) Assist merchants in CorrectionsOne Stores to track visits to and business at their stores, and to process the items in your shopping basket. This information collected by cookies is sometimes called "click stream" or "click trail" and may also describe which pages you have seen in each merchant's store. 
  * (4) Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes and contests. When a CorrectionsOne-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the player's progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings. 
  * (5) Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of CorrectionsOne's network of web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on CorrectionsOne a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites. 



Advertising networks that serve ads onto CorrectionsOne may also use their own cookies. 

CorrectionsOne also collects IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. In addition, CorrectionsOne Mail includes IP addresses in outgoing mail message headers.

**How does CorrectionsOne use my information?**

CorrectionsOne's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of sites. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, CorrectionsOne is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you. 

In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, CorrectionsOne plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). CorrectionsOne takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting that criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information. Only CorrectionsOne has access to individuals' accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional email through CorrectionsOne Delivers. You will not receive special offers via email from CorrectionsOne if you indicate to us that you would not like to receive them. You can change these account preferences at any time. 

CorrectionsOne does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. CorrectionsOne may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners. 

**Who is collecting information?**

When you are on a CorrectionsOne site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with CorrectionsOne alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. For example, some CorrectionsOne services, like CorrectionsOne Event Services, are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide this co-branded service to you, it is necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner company. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than CorrectionsOne, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. 

Promotions that run on CorrectionsOne may be sponsored by companies other than CorrectionsOne or may be cosponsored by CorrectionsOne and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared. 

Please be aware that CorrectionsOne advertisers or web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those web sites linked to CorrectionsOne are not covered by this privacy statement.

**With whom does CorrectionsOne share my information?**

As a general rule, CorrectionsOne will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. Please see the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for each of our products and services for more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed. 

Business Partners & Sponsors: CorrectionsOne may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Details of shared use can be found in specific Terms of Service or Use Agreements, and sweepstakes and promotions rules. Some or all data collected during a CorrectionsOne promotion may be shared with a sponsor. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. 

Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give CorrectionsOne permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared. If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer. 

CorrectionsOne Products & Services: If you make a purchase from a store hosted by CorrectionsOne, or a merchant in CorrectionsOne, the information obtained during your visit to those stores, and the information you give such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to the merchants. This is to enable transactions to take place. 

Merchants listed in CorrectionsOne Shopping or site or in CorrectionsOne Stores have separate privacy and data collection practices. CorrectionsOne has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding the merchant, their store, and their privacy policies, return to that store's home page and click on their Information link. 

From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If you opt-in to receive information from these third parties, CorrectionsOne will (with your permission) share your name and email address with them. 

Third Party Data & Data in the Aggregate: Under confidentiality agreements, CorrectionsOne may match user information with third party data. Also, CorrectionsOne discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 75% of our users are male and are interested in corrections) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 

Other: CorrectionsOne may also disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) CorrectionsOne's rights or property, other CorrectionsOne users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. CorrectionsOne may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain and improve our products and services.

**What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?**

CorrectionsOne may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from CorrectionsOne and our partners, we may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only CorrectionsOne (or agents working on behalf of CorrectionsOne and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time you can easily edit your CorrectionsOne Account Information to no longer receive such offers and mailings. You will need your CorrectionsOne ID and Password in order to access your CorrectionsOne Account Information. 

On some types of CorrectionsOne promotions, we will ask for your email address in order to update you on your score, entries, and status in prize drawings. When you participate in these types of promotions, you automatically receive promotion-related email, unless you choose the no-email option that some promotions offer. Occasionally these promotion-related email messages may include targeted advertisements. 

You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those CorrectionsOne services that require registration in order to participate. These services include (but are not limited to): CorrectionsMail, CorrectionsNetwork, Officer Only Services (Support, Training) and Message Boards. You can still use CorrectionsOne Investigation Tools, CorrectionsOne News Service and CorrectionsOne Directories and Search as well as many other CorrectionsOne services even if you do not accept cookies. 

CorrectionsOne does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer. If you do not wish to allow your data to be shared, you can choose not to use a particular service or not to participate in certain promotions or contests.

**What is CorrectionsOne's policy on allowing me to update, correct, or delete my personally identifiable information?**

You may edit your CorrectionsOne Account Information and your public CorrectionsOne Profile at any time by using your CorrectionsOne ID and password. If you have forgotten your password, please click here to request a new password. For all other problems signing in to CorrectionsOne, please click here and complete this form. 

Your CorrectionsOne account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will result in not being able to access any members-only area of the CorrectionsOne network, including your CorrectionsOne Mail account (if you have one). If you saved the confirmation email you received when you first created your CorrectionsOne account, you can use the URL provided in that message to delete your account at any time. Please contact privacypolicy@CorrectionsOne.com for further instructions about deleting or deactivating your CorrectionsOne account. 

If you are participating in a CorrectionsOne promotion and you wish to update your email address on the promotions mailing list or to quit a promotion and cease receiving promotion-related email, please contact feedback@CorrectionsOne.com. 

Knowing that you use certain services or features may help us to offer you better and more relevant content and advertisements. But as with all personally identifiable information, we do not make this available to any third parties without your permission. Any user statistics that we may provide to prospective advertisers or partners regarding financial product or service usage on CorrectionsOne are provided in the aggregate only and do not include any personally identifiable information about any individual user. 

Please note that there are several places on the CorrectionsOne network of Web sites where you can transmit credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes. Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.

**What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?**

Your CorrectionsOne Account Information and CorrectionsOne Profile are password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information. You may edit your CorrectionsOne Account Information and CorrectionsOne Profile by using your CorrectionsOne ID and password. 

We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. CorrectionsOne will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your CorrectionsOne account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, CorrectionsOne cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

**What security precautions are in place to protect the identity and security of Corrections officials on CorrectionsOne?**

CorrectionsOne has taken several precautions to protect the identity, account names and passwords of officers when they register and log on to CorrectionsOne.com. All transfer of registration and login information is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL). During registration, CorrectionsOne representatives check the identity of potential Correction members with the member's department and either mail or call in the member's password to that department or individual. Unfortunately, this process cannot be 100% secure and CorrectionsOne is not responsible for the misuse of these user names and passwords. Despite all of our precautions, you use CorrectionsOne at your own risk.
