In the United States and Latin America, the term 'children' refers to individuals under 13 years of age.

When we intend to collect personal information from children, we take additional steps to protect children's privacy, including:

  * Notifying parents or legal guardian about our information practices with regard to children, including the types of personal information we may collect from children, the uses to which we may put that; information, and whether and with whom we may share that information;
  * In accordance with applicable law, obtaining consent from parents or legal guardian for the collection of personal information from their children, or for sending information about our Services directly to their children;
  * Limiting our collection of personal information from children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity;
  * Giving parents or legal guardian access or the ability to request access to personal information we have collected from their children and the ability to request that the personal information be changed or deleted.
