On occasion, Personal Data may be provided to us by recruitment agents, former employers and other references that you provide, and, where permitted by law and depending on the role which you have applied for, employment background check providers and criminal records check providers. 

**4\. Purposes and Legal bases for using your Personal Data**

We collect and use your Personal Data for various purposes in connection with administration of the application process. Our processing of Personal Data is based on one or more legal justifications (sometimes called ‘legal bases’). The justifications for processing Personal Data and the purposes of that processing are as follows:

  * to take steps necessary to entering into an employment contract (or for Germany, necessary for hiring decisions), 
    * administering and managing your application;
    * assessing your skills, qualifications and your suitability for our career opportunities;
    * taking measures to verify that the information you have provided is true and accurate, e.g. by means of reference checks;
    * conducting background checks (which may include criminal background checks) as permissible and required for your role, except where your explicit consent is required (see below);
  * to comply with an EU legal obligation to which we are subject (applicable for Germany only where Personal Data is not processed for employment-related purposes), notably: 
    * conducting background checks (which may include criminal background checks) as permissible and required for your role, except where your explicit consent is required (see below);
    * dealing with legal disputes and establishing, exercising and defending (potential) legal claims;
    * complying with applicable EU or member state laws and regulations, such as anti-discrimination legislation;

    * dealing with legal disputes and establishing, exercising and defending (potential) legal claims;
    * complying with other applicable laws and regulations, or relevant codes of conduct;



Our “ **legitimate interests** ,” are to hire qualified and appropriate people, to find the right candidate for future openings and to secure, defend and develop our business; (applicable for Germany only where Personal Data is not processed for employment related purposes);

  * where we have your free and explicit consent, notably: 
    * in some cases, making reference checks to verify that the information you have provided is true and accurate;
    * keeping your record for future hiring needs, including for the purpose of communicating with you and providing you with information regarding potential career opportunities that suit your profile;
    * in some cases, conducting background checks (which may include criminal background checks) as permissible and required for your role.



We require the Personal Data requested in the application process to assess your application for employment with us. We will tell you when we ask for Personal Data due to a contractual requirement or to comply with our legal obligations. If you do not provide some or all of this Personal Data, it may affect our ability to process your application and therefore to enter into an employment agreement with you. If you volunteer to provide the Personal Data to us, you may exercise your right to request that we limit the processing of your Personal Data at any time as set forth in the “Your Rights” section below. 

**5\. Retention of your Personal Data**

We will retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary for the purposes for which the Personal Data was collected and used by us, as stated in this Privacy Notice. In addition, we may retain your Personal Data in order to consider you for other job opportunities for up to 12 months, unless you request that we do not retain your Personal Data. 

If you accept employment with us, your Personal Data will be held on the basis set out in our Employee Privacy Notice. This will generally apply for the duration of your employment relationship with us plus any applicable statutory retention periods.

**6\. Disclosure and transfer of your Personal Data**

The data we collect will be stored in different systems and data bases, including on your application record, in HR files and on other IT systems (including email).

Your Personal Data will be shared for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice with members of our HR and recruitment team, interviewers involved in the recruitment process, managers in the business area with a vacancy and IT staff who need to access any of the Personal Data to perform their roles.

Where you provide us with details on former employers as referees, if your application for employment is successful, we will share your data with former employers to obtain references for you, with employment background check providers to obtain necessary background checks in relation to the specific role and to obtain criminal records checks where permissible and necessary for the role.

We may transfer your Personal Data outside the EEA to other Cognex entities and where our subcontractors or processors host data or process outside the EEA. If we do, we will ensure a similar degree of security of Personal Data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is in place: 

  * We will only transfer your personal data to countries that the European Commission have approved as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data by; or
  * Where we share Personal Data among Cognex entities or where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or 
  * If we use US-based providers that are part of EU-US Privacy Shield, we may transfer data to them, as they have equivalent safeguards in place.



In those cases, you will have the right to ask us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place as mentioned above (e.g. to request a copy where the safeguard is documented, which may be redacted to ensure confidentiality), by contacting us as indicated in Section 9, “Contact us”.

**7\. Security**

We take reasonable steps to ensure that your Personal Data is properly secured using appropriate technical, physical, and organizational measures, so that it is protected against unauthorized or unlawful use, alteration, unauthorized access or disclosure, accidental or wrongful destruction, and loss. 

We take steps to limit access to your Personal Data to those persons who need to have access to it for one of the purposes listed in this Privacy Notice. Furthermore, we contractually ensure that any third party processing your Personal Data equally provides for the confidentiality, security and integrity of your Personal Data.

If you are successful in your application for employment, personal data gathered during the recruitment process will be transferred to your personal file and retained in accordance with our policies. You will be provided a new Employee Privacy Notice at that time.
