Therefore you can remain anonymous when you visit our website. Occasionally you may be asked to give us more specific information about yourself, such as when you download software, register for a seminar or other event, respond to a survey, enter a contest from our website, and register at the customer portal. Supplying such information to us is optional, but you may be unable to complete certain transactions without giving such information.

  * **Strictly necessary** \- Technically essential to the provision of our website. For example, some cookies are used to enable secure login to restricted areas. 
  * **Performance** \- Monitor and assess our website and its use. For example, recording visits to reveal how a website is used and which parts are most popular.

  * **Advertising/targeting** \- Use an identification number to monitor personal preferences for the purposes of personalizing pages and gathering further information. For example, presenting adverts or promotions for products similar to those previously viewed or purchased.

There are two main kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser, whereas persistent cookies remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach their expiry date.

  * IP address;
  * date, time and duration of your visit;
  * browser type;

We do not use this automatically collected information to try to identify you, and we do not associate it with the information you provide voluntarily, as detailed below.

**Information You Provide**

In using our website, conducting business with us or seeking to conduct business with us, you may voluntarily provide personal data to us in the following ways:

Where you are applying for a job, work placement or internship, you will be asked to provide certain additional information, for example about your education, employment history and right to work, we will inform you specifically pursuant to a specific privacy notice for job candidates. 

The information you provide is required to enter into a contract with you (such as in anticipation of an employment contract or a purchase agreement) and failure to provide any information may result in our inability to provide requested services or products or consider your application for employment. 

**Use of Personal Information**

The following is an overview of our purposes for using your personal data. Please remember that additional details on how we process your personal data may be provided to you in a separate notice or contract. 

All processing (i.e. use) of your personal data is justified by a "condition" for processing. In the majority of cases, processing will be justified on the basis that:

  * you have consented to the processing;
  * the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you or take steps to enter into a contract at your request;
  * the processing is necessary for us to comply with a relevant legal obligation; or
  * the processing is in our legitimate interests, subject to your interests and fundamental rights, and notably our legitimate interest in using supplier, customer and website user data to conduct and develop our business activities with them and with others. 



We use the personal data we collect to:

  * better understand your needs for machine vision products;
  * support your customer relationship with Cognex, such as shipping and invoicing;
  * more generally, conduct and develop our business with you and with others;
  * provide you with documentation, white papers, videos, webinars or communications which you have requested;
  * provide you with any other services or products you request; 
  * send you marketing communications, where it is lawful for us to do so;

  * manage a recruitment, work placement or internship process, including considering applications and making offers.



**Sharing of Personal Data**

We are part of the global Cognex group, and from time to time it will be necessary to share your personal data with our affiliated businesses. We will also appoint third party service providers (who will operate under our instructions) to assist us in providing information, products or services to you, in conducting and managing our business, or in managing and improving the website, and these third parties may need access to your personal data. 

If your personal data is transferred outside the EU to other Cognex group companies or to service providers, we will take steps to ensure that you information receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the EEA, including by entering into data transfer agreements using the EU Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses as set forth in Art. 46.2 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or by relying on certification schemes such as the EU - US Privacy Shield as set forth in Art. 45 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation. You have a right to obtain details of the mechanism under which your information is transferred outside of the EU by contacting privacy@cognex.com. 

We may share your personal data with third parties in connection with a potential or actual sale of our company or any of our assets, or those of any affiliated company, in which case personal data held by us about our users may be one of the transferred assets. 

We will also respond to requests for information where required by to do so by law, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, request from a regulator or any other legal process served on us.

**Marketing (SMS & emails)**

Where lawful to do so, and subject to your consent where required, we may communicate with you by SMS and email to tell you about our products and services. If you wish to opt-out of receiving marketing communications, please use the 'unsubscribe' link provided in our emails or text the STOP number in our SMS, or otherwise contact us directly and we will stop sending you communications.

**Security**

We use data storage and security techniques to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification or unlawful destruction or accidental loss. However, it is important to remember that no website can be 100% secure and we cannot be held responsible for unauthorized or unintended access that is beyond our control.

**Retention of your Information**

Your personal data we use to provide information about our products and services, will be retained for a period of 5 years from your last contact with us. Your personal data that we use to provide you products or services you have requested will be retained for the relevant statute of limitations. For other personal data, we apply a general rule of keeping personal data only for as long as required to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected. However, in some circumstances we may retain personal data for periods of time corresponding to legal requirements, for instance in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements.

In specific circumstances we may also retain your personal data for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges.

**External Links**

The website may contain links to third party sites. Since Cognex does not control nor is responsible for the privacy practices of those websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third party sites. This policy applies solely to personal data collected by our websites or in the course of our business activities.

  * to obtain a copy of your personal data together with information about how and on what basis that personal data is processed;
  * to rectify inaccurate personal data (including the right to have incomplete personal data completed); 
  * to erase your personal data (in limited circumstances, such as where it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or processed); 
  * to restrict processing of your personal data where: 
  * the accuracy of the personal data is contested;
  * the processing is unlawful but you object to the erasure of the personal data;
  * we no longer require the personal data but it is still required for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim;
  * to port your data in machine-readable format to a third party (or to you) when we justify our processing on the basis of your consent or the performance of a contract with you;
  * to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data (where that processing is based on your consent);
  * to object to decisions which are based solely on automated processing or profiling; and
  * to obtain, or see a copy of the appropriate safeguards under which your personal data is transferred to a third country or international organization.



In addition to the above rights, you have the right to object to any processing of your personal data that we have justified on the basis of a legitimate interest, including profiling. You also have the right to object to any processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, including profiling for marketing purposes. 

In relation to all of these rights, please contact us using the details given below.
