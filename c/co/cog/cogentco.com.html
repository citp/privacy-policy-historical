<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Cogent and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”) are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. For the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “<strong>GDPR</strong>”), Cogent’s EU Subsidiaries are the data controller.</p>
<p>This policy sets out the basis on which we will process any personal data or usage information we collect from you, or that you provide to us, in connection with your use of the different Cogent websites that link to this policy (the “<strong>Websites</strong>”).

</ul>
<p><strong>Do we use cookies?</strong></p>
<p>We use cookies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different portions of the Website.

<h3>How do we share your personal data?</h3>

If you follow a link to any of these websites, these websites will have their own privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any information to those websites.</p>
<h3>How long do we store your personal data?</h3>
<p>We will retain your Personal Information for as long as our Customer account is active and for a set period afterwards; as needed to provide our Customer products or services; as needed for the purposes outlined in this Policy or at the time of collection; as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements; or to the extent permitted by law.&nbsp; In general, we will retain your Personal Information for a period of seven years after the termination of service to our Customer.</p>
