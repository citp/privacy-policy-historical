We use information gathered from support requests to generally improve our products and services. No specific customer information is stored. We will not transfer information we received during the support process to other customers, any third party or even employees within CogniView that do not require the information in order to assist in the support process of that specific client.

When you access a non-CogniView Web site, please understand that it is independent from CogniView. In addition, a link to a non-CogniView Web site does not mean that we endorse or accept any responsibility for the privacy policies of such Web site.
