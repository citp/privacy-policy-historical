Response to Do Not Track signals Your web browser may transmit a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal to Coworker and other websites. Because of differences in web browsers’ default settings and the manner in which browsers incorporate DNT signals, it is sometimes unclear to site operators whether site visitors have selected the DNT setting themselves, or whether they are aware that they have a choice in determining the setting. Coworker does not currently respond to DNT signals. Once the Internet industry has settled on standards related to this issue and Coworker recognizes such standards, we may reevaluate this approach.
