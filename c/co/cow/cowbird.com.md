##  Information that Cowbird Collects 

Cowbird, Inc. (the “ _Company_ ,” “ _us_ ,” “ _we_ ”) collects personal information when you register with Cowbird, when someone invites you to join Cowbird, and when you use, access, or visit Cowbird. When you register we ask for certain information such as your name and email address. When you register with Cowbird and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. Cowbird is not intended for children under the age of 13. 

The stories, sounds, images, and other media content (“Content”) that you submit for inclusion in Cowbird may reveal personal information about you and the subjects of that Content. We ask that you obtain permission from others and that you carefully consider the information that you want to disclose about yourself and others in the public forum that Cowbird provides. Please be thoughtful and decent. Once you choose to share Content through Cowbird, that Content could potentially be copied and reshared by others with access to Cowbird. 

Cowbird automatically receives and records information from your computer/mobile device and browser, including your IP address/device ID, cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request. Cowbird may set and access Cowbird cookies on your computer. Cowbird may use web beacons and other technologies to track your use of Cowbird. 

It is possible that others may submit Content that provides links to sites and services outside of Cowbird, and this privacy policy does not apply to such third party sites and services. Additionally, some of the services included on Cowbird are delivered or served by third-party companies that may place or recognize cookies, web beacons or other technology to track certain information about our Web site users. For example, we may include in Cowbird certain integrations with third-party social networks. In the course of serving certain third-party social network functionality on Cowbird, some third-party social network operators may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of Cowbird. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads based on your interests on other Web sites. 

We do not have access to, nor control over, third-party companies' use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used.

The Company does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except: (a) to provide products or services that you’ve requested, or (b) if you choose to make such personal information available as part of the Content that you have submitted for use and/or display on Cowbird, or (c) when we have your permission, or (d) under any of the following circumstances: 

We provide certain information to service providers who work on behalf of, or with, the Company to help us provide Cowbird and to communicate with you. 

We provide information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 

We provide information when we believe it may be useful to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, threats to the safety of any person or property, violations of Cowbird’s [Terms of Service](http://cowbird.com/terms/), or as otherwise required by law. 

We would transfer information about you if the Company (or Cowbird) is acquired by or merged with another company or reorganizes itself into another company. In this event, Cowbird will attempt to notify you before information about you becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

We have physical and technical safeguards designed to protect personal information we maintain about you. However, notwithstanding these safeguards, unauthorized persons may access your personal information and account. We cannot promise that your personal information will always be secure.
