### Our Privacy Policy

We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided to us and to our clients through the use of our services and related websites. We created the following policy guidelines with a fundamental respect for your right to privacy to guide our relationship with our users and consumers who use any of the websites, co-branded Microsites, services, or applications owned or provided by us (the "Sites") (collectively or individually, "Consumers").

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to our End User License Agreement, which is applicable to those Consumers who download the Coupons toolbar ("CouponBar") and Coupon Printer applications. Instructions on uninstalling these programs are [available here](http://www.couponsinc.com/corp/source/u_uninstall.asp).

### 1\. Information We Collect 

We may collect information before or after you request a coupon by printing, downloading to a device, saving to a loyalty card and/or digitally displaying, such as via a mobile device; if you have trouble requesting a coupon and contact customer service for support; to fulfill your requests to participate in certain offers and promotions; if you choose to tell a friend about our service; as an affiliate of a Microsite Network; and when you download and install our coupon printing software or toolbar (ActiveX-based or Internet Plug-in) on your computer. Our software and toolbar only collect information about what coupons have been requested and redeemed from your computer.

Consumer Provided Information: When you visit the Sites, you may provide to us what is generally called "personally identifiable" information (such as your name, email address, postal mailing address, and home/mobile telephone number, etc.) if you request a coupon from or otherwise participate in activities offered on the Sites. In addition, you may have the option of providing us with certain demographic information about yourself or your household (such as age, gender, household compensation, interests, zip code, and state).

"Cookies" Information: When you visit the Sites, we may send one or more cookies – a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Sites. These persistent cookies can be removed, but each web browser is a little different. So, please review your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies setup. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on the Sites.

"Automatically Collected" Information: When you use the Sites or open one of our HTML emails, we automatically record certain data using technology, including clear gifs or web beacons; cookies (discussed above); IP addresses; unique "device IDs" (similar to IP addresses); and log files. Automatically collected data includes coupon requesting and redemption activity; web browser type; the website that referred you to us, the web pages you viewed on the Sites; and the dates and times that you visited the Sites.

"Tell-A-Friend" Information: If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Sites, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Sites, and we do not store this information.

Client Provided Information: When we manage coupon promotions for a "Client" (a company or organization to which we provide business services) a unique identifier may be shared with us in order to process the coupon requesting and redemption activity on behalf of that Client. We do not receive any personally identifiable information from these unique identifiers, which are used solely to process the coupon promotion activities.

### 2\. The Way We Use Information

We use the information that we collect to operate, maintain, and provide to Consumers all of the coupons and promotional offerings found on the Sites and for other non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major service updates or for customer service purposes).

We use all of the information that we collect from our Consumers to understand the usage trends and preferences; to improve the way the Sites work and look; to improve our marketing and promotional efforts and to create new features and functionality.

We use automatically collected data to process and record coupon requesting and redemption activity; store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use the Sites; provide custom, personalized coupon promotions, advertisements, content, and information; monitor the effectiveness of marketing campaigns; and monitor aggregate usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.

We will not use your email address or other personally identifiable information that you provide directly to us to send promotional or marketing messages without your consent except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to "opt-out". For example, when you provide us with your email address to receive coupon offers from our Digital FSI network, we will send you a weekly email to tell you about coupons currently available in our network. You may stop receiving those emails by changing your preferences in the Edit Profile screen of the Digital FSI.

### 3\. When We Disclose Information

We disclose automatically collected data (such as coupon request and redeem activity) to our Clients and third-party ad servers and advertisers. These third parties may match this data with information that they have previously collected about you under their own privacy policies, which you should consult on a regular basis.

We disclose both personally identifiable and automatically collected information to our clients, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons to process such information on our behalf; to provide website maintenance and security; to enable us to fulfill coupon requests; to offer certain features on the Sites; to assist us in improving the way the Sites work and look; and to create new features. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy. We use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information, and we require these parties to use any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

We do not share personally identifiable information with other third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your consent except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-out. For example, we offer coupons on our network that require you to fill out an advertiser survey in order to receive the coupon. This data is provided to the advertiser and you will always have the option to say "No Thanks" and return to selecting other coupons.

We may disclose Consumer information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with local, state or federal laws or to respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant.

We also reserve the right to disclose Consumer information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; protect Clients from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Sites; and to protect against fraudulent uses, the rights, property, or safety of the company, our Consumers, our Clients, or others.

### 4\. Your Choices

We provide you the opportunity to opt-out of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you registered for a Digital FSI coupon site but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our Edit Profile page.

If you no longer wish to receive our weekly coupon email alerts and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each email or communication or by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/Corporate/LinkClick.aspx?link=64&tabid=67). 

You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party. 

In some cases if you decline to share personal information on the Sites, we will not be able to provide certain services to you on the Sites. You may update, correct, or delete your personal information and preferences at any time by going to the Edit Profile section of the website from which you are requesting coupons or by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/Corporate/LinkClick.aspx?link=64&tabid=67).  We will respond to your request to access your personal information and preferences within 30 days.

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to personal information or before making corrections. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES.

### 5\. Third-Party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites

Third-party ad servers or ad networks may serve advertisements within the Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Sites. These ad servers automatically receive your IP address when this happens, and they may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content.

If an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-24) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have requested and redeemed certain categories of coupons) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach. In addition, these ad servers may match information relating to your activity with data that they have previously collected pertaining to you under their own privacy policies, which you should consult on a regular basis. To learn more about third-party ad servers and your options, [click here](http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

### 6\. Our Commitment to Data Security

We use commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. WE CANNOT, HOWEVER, ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO US, AND YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK. Once we receive your transmission of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Sites at any time or in any manner. If we learn that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Sites without verified parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
