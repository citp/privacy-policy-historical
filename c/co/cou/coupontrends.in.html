							<p><strong>CouponTrends</strong> is a website that provides online coupons for users to avail discounts from merchants. As a website, we have a privacy policy we expect every user to understand. This includes the activities like gathering information from users to make use of our services, its use and the disclosure. It is requested to go through this privacy policy before using this website. If you use this site, we assume that you agree to our policies.</p>

<p><strong>Information from the users</strong></p>

<p>To make use of some of the services of our website, users need to provide certain personal information. This includes name, full address, age and debit/credit card details to name a few. This data is collected so that you have a better user experience with our site. You may understand that this information is used by us to maintain and improve our services and introduce new services.</p>

<p>It is required that the information you provide must be current, accurate and complete. You may delete or update the information if situation demands like when you change address. People of all ages can use this website. But, we would recommend the consent of an adult if someone below 18 years of age wants to use our services.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>Cookies and other similar tools are excellent ways of knowing the user preferences. A cookie is a piece of information sent to your browser and gets stored in your computer. It then stores information about the ads you clicked and the websites you visited. This is also used to store the information of the registered users. The data collected by the cookie is usually considered as non-personal data. But, you can be assured that the details like your IP address will be treated as personal information.</p>

<p>Cookies are safe because they don’t tell us who you are nor can they access the data in your system. They provide ways to improve the services we provide you by telling us your areas of interest. The users can choose to disable the cookies using the settings. The unique cookie id on the browser is over written with the phrase “OPT_OUT”. Now, there exists no unique cookie id and the opt-out cookie cannot be connected to a particular browser.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing the information</strong></p>

<p>It is our policy to share certain information with our partners like an email service provider so that you receive emails on our behalf. CouponTrends shares personal data to third parties for purposes like advertising or improving our services and not for the marketing of these third parties. If you feel that any of your data should not be shared with a third party, we will be happy to ensure that for you.</p>

<p>We usually share information in the following cases.</p>

<ul>
	<li>During any kind of investigations</li>
	<li>For our proper operation</li>
	<li>With our legal counsels in relation to a legal process</li>
	<li>Situations where there are threats to the physical safety of any person.</li>
	<li>To protect our website users</li>
	<li>To prevent illegal activities</li>
	<li>If any violation of the terms of the privacy policy occurs</li>
</ul>

<p>You may understand that once you leave our page, you cannot depend on our privacy policy. Whenever you enter a new site or application, check its web pages to find out their policies. If you cannot find it, contact the owners of the application or the website to provide you with the information you need. This is important because the site or application could use your data for things you do not agree with.</p>
