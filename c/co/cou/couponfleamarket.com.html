                        The Coupon Flea Market Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize
                        your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk
                        by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses
                        to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by

                        register with Coupon Flea Market site or services, a cookie helps Our Voice USA
                        to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process
                        of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses,
                        and so on. When you return to the same Coupon Flea Market Web site, the information
                        you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Coupon Flea
                        Market features that you customized.<br>
