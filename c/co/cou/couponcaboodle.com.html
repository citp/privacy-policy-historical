Beacons. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>A web beacon is a programming
code that can be used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used
to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you
with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This
allows Company to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to
track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products or
services you may be interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web
pages, Company also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals
listed in Company’s database. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Addresses. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Company automatically tracks
certain information based upon your behavior on the site. We may use this
information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and
behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This
information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on
the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or
not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet
Protocol ("IP") is a unique Internet "address" which is
assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local
area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be
permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically
logged by Web servers, collecting information about a user's traffic patterns.
While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the
cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the
Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are
connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit
have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and
their pages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal Identification
