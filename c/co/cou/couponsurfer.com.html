		<h1>CouponSurfer Privacy Policy</h1>
		
		<hr>
		
		<p>The CouponSurfer.com mission is to simplify the shopping experience of on-line consumers by providing a dedicated web site of major brand promotions. Consumers view coupons at their convenience with an interactive easy-to-use format. CouponSurfer.com saves consumers time and money by eliminating the need for searching through newspapers or hundreds of web sites. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Terms of Use.</p>

		<p>To achieve this mission, we need to collect information to understand what products and services you are most interested in. We collect this information as specified below.</p>

		<p>First, you provide us with some basic information when you register. All of the information we collect, is 'aggregated', meaning that the information from many users is grouped together in a way that does not disclose the personal information of any particular user. We also sometimes receive updated email addresses from our trusted partners so that we can correct our records and communicate more easily (if you selected to receive emails). We use this aggregated information to provide you with the regional and national brand coupons you are interested in. CouponSurfer.com will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process. Please note that as CouponSurfer.com grows, we may sell or buy other companies or assets. In such transactions, customer information is typically one of the transferred assets. Also in the unlikely event that CouponSurfer, Inc. or it's assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.</p>

		<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Privacy Policy, CouponSurfer.com and its third party service providers, including Empyr, Inc. (“Empyr”) that enable us to provide CouponSurfer.com platform (“Third Party Service Providers”) will use CouponSurfer Dining Rewards transaction information solely as follows:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Use your transaction data to confirm a Qualifying Purchase or return to match transactions to confirm whether you qualify for a statement credit or an Offer;</li>
			<li>May share transaction data with the participating merchant where a transaction occurred as needed for the merchant to confirm a specific transaction occurred or points should be awarded; for example, the date and amount of your purchase and the last 4 digits of your card number so the merchant can verify your purchase with its records if there is a missing or disputed transaction;</li>
			<li>May provide participating merchants or Third Party Service Providers aggregated and anonymized information relating specifically to registered card activity solely to allow participating merchants and Third Party Service Providers to assess the results of their campaign;</li>
			<li>Create a record of the transaction data and thereafter maintain and use data in connection with operating CouponSurfer.com platform;</li>
			<li>Provide targeted offers that may be of interest to you;</li>
			<li>Conducting analysis for the improvement and optimization of CouponSurfer.com platform; and</li>
			<li>May provide information in order to respond to a request from government authority or a payment organization involved in a transaction with you or a merchant.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>You authorize the sharing, exchange and use of transaction data described above and herein by and among CouponSurfer.com and CouponSurfer.com’s Third Party Service Providers, applicable Payment Card Networks and applicable merchants. You may opt-out of transaction monitoring on the payment card(s) you have registered here.</p>
		
		<p>Second, we may track your visit to our site by giving you a "cookie" when you enter. Cookies are pieces of information that Web sites transfer to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We use Cookies so that you won't have to re-enter your password and CouponSurfer ID when you visit CouponSurfer.com. Cookies are also used to track user trends and patterns. We also may use third party advertisements on CouponSurfer.com. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP and the browser used to visit CouponSurfer.com. This information is generally used for geotargeting purposes (such as showing San Francisco grocery ads to someone in San Francisco) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing travel ads to someone who frequents travel sites). <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/">You may opt-out of the use of the Google cookie by clicking here</a>. The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and you'll find them used on most major Web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you've received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that areas of certain sites will not function properly if you set your browser to not accept cookies.</p>

		<p>Third CouponSurfer sometimes uses third-parties for advertising and analytics for pages that we host. These third-parties may place Cookies on your computer, use web beacons, gather IP addresses and log data to collect traffic and activity data in order to deliver relevant metrics, content, and advertising. By using Couponsurfer, you consent to us sharing a hashed, nonhuman readable version of your email address with our partners who may drop a Cookie on your browser and match your email with its marketing file to create a link between your browser and our partner's record of you. This link may be shared by our partner globally for the purpose of improving the relevance of online advertising and content by third parties that are unaffiliated with CouponSurfer. You may opt out of your data being used for this purpose at our partners' opt-out centers: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info">Digital Advertising Alliance</a> and <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Networking Advertising Initiative</a>.</p>

		<p>In addition when you become a member, you can select whether to receive new coupon alerts emails and the CouponSurfer.com email newsletter. Besides the user confirmation message, you will only receive email from CouponSurfer.com if you choose to receive new coupon alerts and/or the CouponSurfer.com. You have the option to change your email preferences at any time if you wish to stop receiving email from CouponSurfer.com by going to <a href="https://www.couponsurfer.com/user_update.cfm">Your Account</a> or contacting support@couponsurfer.com</p>
