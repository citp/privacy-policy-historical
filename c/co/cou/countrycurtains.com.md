Our Web site is designed to be secure, so that when you submit sensitive information it is protected both on-line and off-line. Security on our site includes several precautions. 

Most of the activity on our site involves the viewing of product pages or content that is made accessible to everyone. However, the entire checkout process takes place in a secure environment using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts the data. SSL technology is an industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. Once you have clicked on the checkout button, your browser looks for a digital certificate. We use VeriSignas our SSL (Secure Socket Layer) digital certificate provider and to verify that countrycurtains.com is a VeriSignsecure site. Please click the VeriSignlogo to verify our certification as a secure site.

All sensitive information you enter during the checkout process (including credit card number, name and address) is encrypted under this protocol while traveling the Internet. The second aspect of our security works behind the scenes. We protect all of your private information, including your order information and credit card number, behind a network security system called a "firewall." Only select Country Curtainsstaff has access to this information, and then only enough to service your order.

As a final precaution, we authorize all credit card transactions through the same processes that we use for traditional phone, fax or mail orders. We process credit card transactions through an industry leading credit card service company.
