# Fraud Protection & Privacy | CouponFactory

## Nobody likes a fraud

We believe private things should stay that way. See how we help protect your investment with fraud prevention and how we protect your information with our privacy policy.

What do we do to help prevent fraud and keep your coupon safe and sound? All kinds of things.

  * We avoid having the coupon image appear on a computer screen.
  * We never allow the user to modify print quantity or print destination.
  * We don't deliver or store our coupons in PDF or other formats that can be emailed.
  * We have anti-counterfeiting technology that deters fraudulent coupon redemption.
  * Our coupons clearly identify the authorized consumer by name and email, state or ZIP code, and a unique identification number.
  * All of our coupons are strictly available in color. Why? This increases the cost to counterfeiters and increases the likelihood of detection, which decreases counterfeiters even bothering to try.
  * Our coupons have a minimum of three obvious security features, and one or more security features that are not so obvious.
  * We have a comprehensive analytical dashboard that can be used the monitor and detect fraudulent behavior.



## Commitment to Privacy

The top priority of CouponFactory, Inc. is to provide you with outstanding products. To achieve this goal, we must collect, maintain and use certain personal and financial information.

Your privacy is important to CouponFactory, and we want you to know about our online privacy policies and practices.

## Information CouponFactory Collects Online

CouponFactory gathers, retains and utilizes information about you to operate our business and to make our products, information and opportunities available to you. We collect this information when you provide it through voluntary registration. We will not collect personally identifiable information about you (such as your name, address, telephone number, Social Security number, billing and shipping information, credit card information or email address) unless you have provided it to us voluntarily, or we have obtained it from publicly available information or third parties with whom we conduct business. We shall only use the information for purposes for which it was collected and to send our visitors information about our company and our products. We also use it to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help better understand the demographics of our audience.

## Visitor Tracking

We sometimes collect anonymous information through the use of various technologies, possibly including one called "cookies," to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on the CouponFactory website, but we do so in ways that keep the information anonymous. This anonymous information is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data." CouponFactory or its analytic vendors may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.

Also, when we collect personal data, we may extract some information and combine it with other information, such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. None of this information is reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your personal information used in this manner, you can opt out by clicking on the link to our "Contact Us" page.
