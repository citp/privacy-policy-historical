    <p>
        Coupon Tweet is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following
        policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full
        use of our many offerings. This policy may change from time to time so please check
        back periodically. This Privacy Statement only covers the site Coupon Tweet.
    </p>
    <h2>
        P3P
    </h2>
    <p>
        Coupon Tweet is in compliance with the current draft of the World Wide Web Consortium
        (W3C) Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) specification, http://www.w3c.org/P3P,
        dated April 16, 2002. This specification was developed to allow users to more easily
        evaluate the use of personal information collected by the web sites they visit.
        Thus, if your browser is Microsoft Internet Explorer Version 6, or later, your browser
        can electronically interpret the P3P version of our privacy policies.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy
        statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware
        of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if
        any, we disclose it.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Collection and use of Personal Information
    </h2>
    <p>
        Providing personal information is voluntary. Coupon Tweet will collect and use personal
        information about you to respond to your request for products and services offered
        through this website. We will also collect information in order to customize the
        advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services,
        improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting
        for internal and external clients. Once you register with Coupon Tweet and sign
        in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. The information we collect may
        be from the following sources:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information provided by you in connection with obtaining financial products or services
            such as mortgage loans (such as full name, telephone number, and self-assessed property
            value). </li>
        <li>Information you provide us when you register for a user account to receive communications
            from us (such as your email address). </li>
        <li>Information you provide us when you enter promotions or sweepstakes offered by Coupon
            Tweet or our co-branded/partnership sites (such as your full name, physical address
            and email address). </li>
        <li>Information you provide us through surveys, feedback, or other forms hosted on our
            website or the pages of a Coupon Tweet partner/affiliates. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We also collect demographic information. Demographic information is all other information
        such as gender, zip code, or any information that is not tied to your personal information.
        In addition, we might receive information about you from other sources (such as
        service providers) for tracking purposes. We may add the information we receive
        about you to your existing account. Like other websites, we also automatically receive
        and record certain types of information every time you visit us. We use "cookies"
        and the other information to enhance your experience and present you with personalized
        offers. See "Cookies and IP Addresses" section below.
    </p>
    <h2>
        With whom your Information may be shared
    </h2>
    <p>
        Coupon Tweet does not sell trade or rent your personal information to other people
        or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested,
        when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
    </p>
    <p>
        Service Requests or Loan Products - If you submit a request for a loan product or
        service offered through this website we will share the personal information contained
        in your request form, such as your full name, physical address, telephone number,
        property location and self-assessed value, with lenders in our provider network
        strictly to process and fulfill your request. All lenders in our provider network,
        which include banks, mortgage lenders and brokers, have entered into marketing agreements
        with Coupon Tweet and are required to comply with federal and state privacy regulations.
        The lenders may contact you by telephone, email, or mail based on the information
        you provided to us in order to process and fulfill your request, even if you have
        opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission
        or any state equivalent Do Not Call List. If one of the lenders contacts you by
        telephone and you wish not to be contacted again by that lender with respect to
        your inquiry, then you should specifically make a request to that lender not to
        contact you again. If the lender disregards your request and contacts you again,
        please let us know immediately by sending an email to Coupon Tweet Customer Support.
        Please note that the lenders may maintain the information you provided whether you
        elect to use their services or not.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other Service or Products Requests - If you submit a request for a product or service
        other than a loan such telecommunication service, we will share the personal information
        contained in your request form such as your full name, telephone number and email
        address with our business partners to process and fulfill your request. Our business
        partners may contact you by telephone, email, or mail based on the information you
        provided to us, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered
        by the Federal Trade Commission or any state equivalent Do Not Call List. If one
        of our partners contacts you by telephone and you wish not to be contacted again
        by that business partner with respect to your inquiry, then you should specifically
        make a request to that partner not to contact you again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vendors - We sometimes disclose the information we collect to companies that host
        certain services for us such as marketing distribution services on our behalf. These
        vendors only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions,
        and may not share it with others or use it for any other purpose. These companies
        are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that
        prohibit them from using the information except to market the specified Coupon Tweet
        products or services.
    </p>
    <p>
        As Permitted by Law - We may be required to share your personal information with
        law enforcement or government agencies in response to subpoenas, court orders, federal/state
        audits or similar circumstances. We believe it is necessary to share information
        in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected
        fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person,
        violations of Coupon Tweet's Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        Business Transfer - As with any other business, it is possible that Coupon Tweet
        in the future could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition
        occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by
        Coupon Tweet, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound
        by this privacy policy unless you consent otherwise. We will provide notice in this
        instance as defined in our "Changes to this Privacy Policy" section below.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Cookies and IP Addresses
    </h2>
    <p>
        To serve you faster and with better quality, we use "cookies" technology. Cookies
        are small bits of code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive, which enable
        a Web site to "personalize" itself for each user. We generally use cookies to reduce
        the time it takes for pages to load on your computer and to assist with customer
        tracking. Customer tracking (or "click-stream") data collected by us is used to
        optimize your experience by learning whether or not you successfully used Coupon
        Tweet. Cookies are not tied to your personal information. Additionally, we may capture
        click-stream data on some of our partner's web sites, limited to the activity involved
        with the completion of offers listed on our web site. This information is used to
        monitor the performance of our partners. We also allow select third-parties to set
        cookies on our website. For example, we use a tracking service, Revenue Science,
        that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about our visitors.
        This aggregate visitor usage information collected on Coupon Tweet and used by the
        Revenue Science network for the purposes of delivering relevant advertising to our
        audience. Other examples include session cookies when accessing the Blog section
        of the website. These cookies simply track the session and are not tied to your
        personal information. We also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An
        IP Address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your
        computer every time you log on to the Internet.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Clear Gifs
    </h2>
    <p>
        We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
        that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
        Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies,
        and are used to track the online movement of Web users. Clear gifs are not tied
        to users' personally identifiable information. We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based
        emails to let us know which emails the recipients have opened. This allows us to
        gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing
        campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out
        section within any email you receive from us or unsubscribe from our homepage.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Confidentiality and Security
    </h2>
    <p>
        The security of your personal information is very important at Coupon Tweet and
        we take a number of steps to safeguard it. For example: We limit access to personal
        information to those employees or agents who assist us in providing requested products
        and services to you. Employees are required to comply with our strict policies and
        procedures regarding the handling of your personal information. Employees who violate
        these policies are subject to our normal disciplinary process. We maintain physical,
        electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard
        personal information about you. We use industry standard data encryption technologies
        when transferring and receiving consumer data on the Coupon Tweet website.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Opting-Out
    </h2>
    <p>
        You may register to receive communications from us directly on our website or through
        a third party. When you subscribe, we will periodically send you a newsletter e-mail
        featuring special and exclusive offers, promotions and other members-only benefits.
        If you no longer wish to receive these communications, please let us know by contacting

        or use the unsubscribe link located in the footer of our site, Coupon Tweet. Our
        email database is updated continually. However, you may continue to receive email
        communications from us up to ten business days from the time we receive your unsubscribe
        request. Please note that Coupon Tweet can only control its own mailing list and
        policies. Third party advertisers that maintain their own mailing lists may send
        communications that advertise our services, and you may need to contact these parties
        directly in order to stop receiving their email communications.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Message Boards/Chat Rooms/Blogs
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you use a message board, chat room, or blog on this site, you should be aware
        that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected,
        or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited
        messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you

    </p>
    <h2>
        Third Party Links
    </h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to all information that you provide to Coupon Tweet.
        However, when you visit websites to which Coupon Tweet provides a link, keep in
        mind you will be interacting with a third party that operates under its own privacy
        and security policy. If you choose to obtain certain services through a third party
        site, the data collected by the third party is governed by that third party's privacy
        policy. A third party site will also have its own policy regarding the use of cookies
        and clear gifs. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service
        provider from whom you request services.
    </p>
    <p>
        If Coupon Tweet receives personal information from a third party that is not in
        conjunction with a service offered on our site, the use and disclosure of such information
        is governed by the agreement (if any) between Coupon Tweet and such third party.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Framing
    </h2>
    <p>
        In some cases, we may use third party vendors to operate portions of the Coupon
        Tweet website. Although the particular section of the website may have a similar
        appearance as the Coupon Tweet site, information submitted through these outside
        third parties are subject to this Privacy Policy unless otherwise stated. For example,
        personal information submitted through our Affiliate Program is subject to our Affiliate
        Program operator's privacy policy.
