# Privacy Policy - CouponSnapshot

### Privacy Statement

CouponSnapshot is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our offerings. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. This Privacy Statement only covers the site CouponSnapshot.

### Personal Data

Only a user's email address is collected when users provide registration to CouponSnapshot. By registering, you agree that CouponSnapshot may send you periodical emails promoting coupons and specials from the CouponSnapshot merchant base that may be of interest to you. All CouponSnapshot email newsletters may be opted out of by simply clicking on a link within each email to remove your email address from the list. Email addresses are never shared or sold to third-party marketers or third-party agencies.

### Aggregated Information

Aggregated information, such as which page users access or visit, and information volunteered by users is collected through various methods. For example, CouponSnapshot collects IP addresses; an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers (the computers that "serve up" Web pages) automatically identify your computer by its IP address; when you request a page from CouponSnapshot, our servers log your IP address. 

CouponSnapshot only uses IP addresses for the purposes of Web traffic analysis and trends.
