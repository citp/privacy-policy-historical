Your Internet Service Provider allocates an IP address to your computer in order for it to access the Internet. The IP address is considered to be non-personal information and it may be dynamic (changing every time you connect to the Internet) or it may be static (unique to your computer). We collect your IP address in order to facilitate our administration and improvement of this site. The information derived from your IP address can help us diagnose server problems, report aggregate information and determine the fastest route from your computer to our Courts Webstore. The site sends a "cookie" to your Web browser in order to facilitate and customise your use of this Courts Webstore. A "cookie" is a small data text file stored in the hard drive of your computer (if it so permits), which can be retrieved to identify you to eCourts.com. This Courts Webstore uses passive "persistent" cookies, which will remain on your hard drive until deleted. A cookie sent to this site by your Web browser will contain information that you have previously entered, enabling us to customise the Courts Webstore to your preferences. These cookies will not give us any other personal information about you.

This Courts Webstore also uses "session" cookies, which are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser or shut down your computer. The information collected by such cookies is needed to improve navigation and to collect aggregate information.

"Navigational data" comprises data files such as "log files", "server logs" and "clickstream" data, which are obtained by this Courts Webstore from your browser and used for maintenance of the system, improving the content of the site, market research and communication of information to visitors.
