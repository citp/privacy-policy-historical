######  Protecting information and security

The Website takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can contact us at [privacy@coursehero.com](mailto:privacy@coursehero.com).

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.

Afterwards, we retain some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally. 

**What Security Measures Do We Use?** We seek to protect Personal Data using appropriate technical and organizational measures based on the type of Personal Data and applicable processing activity. 

**Personal Data of Children:** As noted in the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use/), we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13.

Company’s compliance with the Privacy Shield is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
