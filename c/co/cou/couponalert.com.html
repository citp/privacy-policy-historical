        <p style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Calibri;line-height:18px;">
            <br>Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies
            which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling
            and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described
            in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to
            visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside
            or outside the United States.
            <br><br><u>Aggregated and non-personal information</u>. We may share aggregated and non-personal
            information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and
            our IAC sister companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of
            third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal
            information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties,
            including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.
            For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our CouponAlert Site and the most
            popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and
            may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of
            interest and to target content and advertising.
            <br><br><b>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</b><br><br>
            There are a number of places on the CouponAlert Site where you may click on a link to access other
            websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on a news link, social
            media link or advertisement, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party
            websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you
            and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We
            recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on
            the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.
            <br><br><b>YOUR CHOICES ABOUT COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</b><br>
            You can choose not to allow Mindspark to collect certain information, but that may result in you being
            unable to use all of the features of the CouponAlert Site and/or Toolbar.
            You may tell us not to share your personal information with third parties or the IAC family of companies
            for direct marketing purposes by clicking on the following link and entering the email address
            associated with your account: <a href="http://www.mailunsubscribe.com/optout.jsp?pid=GDNS99" target="_blank">Un-subscribe</a>
            <br><br><b>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br><br>
            We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help
            safeguard your information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized
            employees are permitted to access your information, and they may do so only for permitted business
            functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of any personal information between your
            system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your
            personal information. <br>
            <br>We want you to feel confident using our Website. However, no system can be completely secure.
            Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not
            expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.
            Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should
            avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's
            website at
            <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" target="_blank">FTC</a>

            <br><br><b>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</b><br><br>
            Our website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from
            children under the age of 13.
            <br><br><b>VISITING OUR WEBSITES FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES</b><br><br>
            This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on or via the CouponAlert Site from
            residents of the United States. If you are using the CouponAlert Site from outside the United States,
            please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States
            where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws
            of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please
            be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our
            services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third
            parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.
            <br><br><b>NO RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES</b><br><br>
            This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any
            personal information relating to users of the website.
            <br><br><b>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b><br><br>
            We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When

            provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an email address),
            and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on the CouponAlert Site. We recommend that you check
            our website from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our
            other policies. <br>

            our site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our
            site. When you sign in to your account on our website, we will record your user or member ID and the

            providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as
            doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.
            You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click "Help" in the

            <br><br>We may allow third-parties, including IAC companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to
            display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to
            collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not
            provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where
            you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and
            possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also
            may combine this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of
            that information is subject to the third-party's privacy policy. This information allows them to
            deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising
            companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which
            offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies

            Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique
            identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or
            to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons
            are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of
            this sentence. <br>
            Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain
            pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may include web beacons in promotional [or other] e-mail
            messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. We also may
            receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement
            displayed on a third-party website.
