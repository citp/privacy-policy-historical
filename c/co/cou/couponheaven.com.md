You privacy is very important to us! CouponHeaven.com does not require a user name or password at any time, and you are free to use our site anonymously.

If you elect to use our “Tell-a-Friend” service to refer a friend to our site, you will be asked for the friend’s name and email address (as well as your own). Your friend will receive a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. CouponHeaven.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. _Your information and your friend’s information will never be shared with anyone - period._
