**Co-branded Relationships and Strategic Partners  
**Users may experience CouplesCompany.com within a co-branded environment alongside one of our partners. These companies are strategic partners.

In such situations, individual user information may be shared only between our two companies in an effort to better understand and meet our customers' needs. An example of this would be your region of the country or zip code.
