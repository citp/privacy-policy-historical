##### What is a cookie?

The information supplied by a cookie can help us provide you with a better online experience and assist us in the profile of our visitors. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. You have the option to set your computer to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that personalised services cannot be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the Coursework.info features. For more information on cookies please visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).

##### Security

Coursework.info has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under its control. Please try and keep your log in information (username and/or password) secure at all times. If you suspect that the security of your log in information has been breached you can gain access to your members account area and change both your password and email address under the option 'Change your E-mail address or Password'.
