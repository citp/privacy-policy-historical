<p>From time to time, unless we have stated otherwise, we may provide certain information to selected Service Partners in order to effectively provide the product or service requested. For example, in providing ISP mediation services for our customers, we may need to share information about the email campaign practices of your end users with support personnel at Internet abuse desks. Coupon Sense limits the provision of personally identifying information to a minimum in handling such matters, and does so only under a services agreement with your consent.</p>
<p>In addition, Coupon Sense may from time to time retain the services of outside contractors and Service Partners to provide and/or host online services for our customers. They may be used to provide online maintenance and technical support or perform other services for us. We require that these contractors keep the personal information of customers secure and confidential. We also require that these contractors and Service Partners use your personal and account information only on behalf of Coupon Sense and/or to suggest enhancements to your use of the Coupon Sense Websites.</p>
<p>If you prefer that we not provide your information to our Service Partners, you may let us know by using one of the methods described in this policy.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Disclosures</strong></p>
<p>Please be advised that in certain instances, it may be necessary for Coupon Sense to disclose your personal information to government officials or otherwise as required by our legal obligations. This could include a court proceeding that requires us to disclose such information.</p>
<p><strong>Limiting the Use of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Coupon Sense provides a number of ways for you to ‘opt-out’ of receiving additional information from us or having us provide your personal information to our Service Partners. We may offer you these choices at the time you give us your information and/or at the time you access Coupon Sense online service portals.</p>
<p>If you would like to change your user preferences and account information, you may contact Coupon Sense and/or access the administrative pages for your account on the applicable Coupon Sense Website.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to continue receiving any online promotional communications from Coupon Sense, such as e-mail or online newsletters, you can opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to the unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or changing your communication preferences on the administrative pages for your account.</p>
<p><strong>Security and Quality of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We have taken security measures to protect your personal information, including technical and procedural steps to protect your data from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction.</p>
<p>Since Coupon Sense is a global company, we provide company information to our worldwide offices. The personal information that you have provided to us may be transferred to other Coupon Sense servers around the world. Also, in certain countries our outside contractors might undertake the collection, transferring, storage and processing of your information.</p>
<p>We make a sincere effort to respond to your requests to update or correct your personal information. If you believe that Coupon Sense does not have your current personal information, you can update it by using one of the communication channels at the bottom of this statement.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Coupon Sense may use cookies from time to time. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual’s computer that allows us to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in our databases. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Coupon Sense may use cookies to personalize your experience on our online services or portal pages, or to track end user usage of Coupon Sense services for customers.

Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use of some of the products and/or services at the Coupon Sense Websites.</p>
<p>Coupon Sense may also use cookies to track your visit to our Websites. While our Web servers may automatically log your IP address, such basic Internet traffic statistics will not be tied back to other personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Web Site Traffic</strong></p>
<p>We may track domain names, IP addresses, email addresses and browser types from people who visit our Websites. Such information is not correlated with any personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Other Privacy Management Practices</strong></p>
<p>Please remember that information you submit in a discussion group, blog or other forum will be deemed published, public information and is therefore no longer confidential. The communication of personal and account information in such venues means that that information can be collected and used by others, and you should assess that risk before doing so. This includes your disclosure of information concerning your account profile, personal data, or other data obtained by use of the Coupon Sense Websites.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Changes</strong></p>
<p>In the event there is a major change to Coupon Sense’ privacy practices, Coupon Sense will provide its users advance notice on the Coupon Sense website and/or user portal.</p>
<p>If the change involves the use of your personally identifiable information, the notice will contain instructions on how you can opt-out of such use or modify your information to suit the intended use.</p>
