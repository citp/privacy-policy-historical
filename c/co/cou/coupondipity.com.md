**** PRIZE/GIVEAWAY DISCLAIMER ****

When I offer prizes for giveaways on my blog Coupondipity I do so on good faith that the sponsor will honor our arrangement and send the winner/winners their prize/prizes.

If for some reason you are a prize winner and you do not receive your prize in a reasonable amount of time please contact me directly at coupondipity@live.com. I will contact the sponsor to try and find out about the status of your prize.

**In the event the sponsor does not reply to my e-mails or fails to send the prize I am not to be held responsible or liable in any way. Failure to produce a prize falls solely on the sponsor. I cannot be held accountable for the actions of the sponsor**.

Please note that sometimes prizes take a while to process and ship. Please allow for a reasonable amount of time to receive your prize. If you do not receive anything within 3 weeks please feel free to contact me. Prizes can take from 1-8 weeks to be shipped out, depending on the prize and the company. Please do not wait months to contact me about a prize not received because by then it could be too late.

**All rules of the giveaway must be followed or entries will be voided.  **Failure to comply with the main entry requirement will null and void all extra entries. **   **I have the right to remove entries if I feel they are in violation of any rules (Twitter and Facebook rules included) or considered SPAM. I also check all extra entry options to make sure they are legitimate and follow the rules.

Occasionally a sponsor might have rules set up as to how many wins a single person can have each month. If a sponsor does not want to award multiple prizes to a single winner during a specific time frame I have no control over that and is an issue the winner must take up with the sponsor. Sponsor has the right to refuse awarding prize for duplicate winners from other blogs.

Giveaways are open to U.S residents and occasionally Canadian residents, unless otherwise noted. You must be 18 years or older to enter.

Winners are chosen using Random.org. Winners are contacted via e-mail and have 48 hours to reply or a new winner will be chosen in their place. Please be sure to check your SPAM folder. I am not liable for e-mails that end up in your SPAM folder and are deleted by you.  (Except where otherwise stated in the Terms and Conditions in each Individual Giveaway)

When using the Twitter “tweeting” option you are allowed a maximum of 1 tweet per day. All others will be disqualified.

Entering any giveaways on this site means that you have read and acknowledged all points in this disclaimer.

**Compliance with children’s online privacy protection act**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

**Changes to this privacy policy**

Coupondipity® has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will post a notification on the main page of our Site,  revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this privacy policy periodically and become aware of modifications.
