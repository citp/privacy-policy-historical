We collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Firefox or Internet Explorer), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site coupons.in.

If anything comes to your attention which could potentially be a violation of this policy, please let us know immediately so that we can investigate it and try to correct it.

**Privacy Policy of Third Parties**
