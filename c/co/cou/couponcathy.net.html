<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong> <br>
  This Privacy Policy tells&nbsp;you the types of  information we collect when you use our Sites or Services, how we use that  information, and the instances in which we share your information. </p>
<p>(CouponCathy.net) Privacy Policy </p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY OF KEY PRINCIPLES</strong> <br>

<p><br>
  <strong>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHAT  INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong> <br>
  We collect two kinds of information related to you: (a) Personally  Identifiable Information (“PII”); and (b) Non-Personally Identifiable  Information (“Non-PII”).&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>(a) Personally Identifiable  Information:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>PII includes any information that identifies you as  person.&nbsp;<a name="_DV_M28"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;We collect your PII when you choose to register with us or when  you choose to participate in an interactive feature of our Sites such as a  review,&nbsp;<u>survey</u>&nbsp;or promotion.&nbsp;<a name="_DV_M32"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may: (a)  provide your name, mail/shipping address, email address, credit card number and  phone number when registering with our Sites or in connection with a contest  entry; (b) provide certain demographic information about you (e.g., age,  gender, shopping interests and preferences, etc.) when participating in&nbsp;<u>a survey</u>&nbsp;or poll; or (c) post a general comment and/or recommendation on  our Sites.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="_DV_M39"></a>Non-Personally  Identifiable Information:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="_DV_M40"></a>Non-PII is any  information that does not identify you as a person including PII which has been  rendered anonymous.&nbsp;<a name="_DV_M43"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;We obtain non-PII either separately or together with your PII as  described above. We collect certain non-PII from you when you access our Sites  including IP addresses and information relating to your browser, operating  system, ISP, the third party website from which your visit originated and how  you use our Sites such as the web pages you visit, and the duration of your  visits. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="_DV_M50"></a>HOW WE USE &amp; SHARE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong> <br>
  PII and Non-PII is used to provide, or improve, our Sites and  Services to you and to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries,  better serve you and understand your needs, or is used in other ways naturally  associated with the circumstances in which you provided the information.&nbsp;<a name="_DV_M54"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><a name="_DV_M58"></a>We may disclose PII and Non-PII to: <br>
  &nbsp;(1) our third  party service providers who perform functions on our behalf in connection with  the operation of the Sites or Services e.g., providers who host and manage  data, process credit card orders, deliver our merchandise, etc;&nbsp;<a name="_DV_M62"></a>&nbsp; </p>
<p>(2) participating  sponsors to a program or promotion you enter through our Sites or Services; </p>
<p>(3)our parent  company, subsidiaries or other affiliated companies (“&nbsp;affiliated companies”) for operational, marketing and  promotional purposes; </p>
<p>(4) co-promotional  partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships&nbsp;; </p>
<p>(5) participating  merchants where you consent at the time you submit PII to us when using the  interactive features of our Sites such as surveys and reviews concerning our  participating merchants; and </p>
<p>(6) our other users  where you choose to publicly post reviews, comments or other information  relating to products or services, communicate with other users via public forums  (e.g., forums, message boards, bulletin boards, etc.). </p>
<p>In addition, we use non-PII to help analyze site traffic,  understand customer needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities  (see “Preference Based Advertising” below).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may use your non-PII by itself or aggregate it with  information we have obtained from others to&nbsp;produce research  reports and other information and data about online shopping for participating  merchants and other customers, as well as media and other interested parties. </p>
<p><strong>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COOKIES  AND PREFERENCE BASED ADVERTISING</strong> <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(a)</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We and the third parties we authorize  automatically receive and store certain types of non-PII whenever you interact  with us by using "cookies" and analogous technology.  "Cookies" are small files that are placed on your computer or your  internet browser memory to enable the owner of the cookie to recognize your  browser and to provide convenience and other features to you. So, for example,  our cookies may allow us to show you the past products you have searched for on  our Sites. <strong>It is important to note that the  cookies that we use, or permit others to use, do not contain and are not tied  to PII about you.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>
  <br>
  You may be able to direct your internet browser not to allow cookies and you  can typically delete existing cookies from your computer at any time. Please  note, however, some elements of our Sites will not function properly or be  available to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Preference Based Advertising:&nbsp;</strong>We also work with and  permit certain third parties, including advertising networks and website  analysis firms, to place cookies on your computer/browser when you visit our  Sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;These third party cookies are used to  gather non-PII about your activities on our Sites and third party sites to  serve you with advertisements while you are on third party sites (“Third-Party  Ads”).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not wish to  participate in this activity, please&nbsp;<u>click here</u>&nbsp;to opt-out&nbsp;. </p>
<p>Some important notes: (1) the opt-out tools for Third-Party Ads  include all the advertising networks that (CouponCathy.net)&nbsp;  works with, but also many that (CouponCathy.net)&nbsp;  does not work with; (2) opting out of Our Ads does not automatically  serve as an opt-out from Third-Party Ads – the same is true the other way  around.&nbsp;&nbsp;To opt-out of Our Ads and Third-Party  Ads, you must use each respective opt-out tool above; (3) the opt-out tools for  both Our Ads and Third-Party Ads rely on cookies to ensure that your non-PII is  not used for online advertising purposes (“Opt-out Cookies”).&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, i&nbsp;f you buy a new computer, change web browsers or delete these  Opt-out Cookies from your computer, you will need to perform the relevant  opt-out tasks again; and (4) the features of your internet browser and/or  certain add-on software may allow you to block or limit the use of cookies for  preference based advertising and other purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot, however, promise that our Sites will work well or be  compatible with these alternative methods of blocking or limiting the use of  cookies. </p>
<p><strong>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SALE  OF BUSINESS AND DISCLOSURE BY LAW</strong> <br>
  <strong>(a) Business Transactions:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We may disclose PII  and Non-PII held by us&nbsp;: (a) to a prospective seller or actual seller of any business or  assets we acquire;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if all or any of  our assets are acquired&nbsp;by a third party, in which case, PII  and Non-PII may be one of the transferred assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Required disclosures</strong>&nbsp;<strong>:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><a name="_DV_C67"></a><a name="_DV_C68"></a>We&nbsp;<a name="_DV_M105"></a>may disclose and  use any PII or non-PII if we are required to do so by law, with respect to  copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims, or if we believe  that such action is necessary to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform  with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our  legal rights or property, our Sites, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to  protect the health and safety of our Sites<a name="_DV_C71"></a>'&nbsp;<a name="_DV_M107"></a>s users or the general public. </p>
<p><strong>V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECURITY  OF INFORMATION</strong> <br>
  We work to protect the security of your information during  transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information  you input. We also use a secure server hosting location in the US, firewall  protection, controlled access and encryption technology to protect your data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please be advised, however, that while  we strive to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of  any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible  for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your PII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unfortunate event that your  personally identifiable information is compromised, we will notify you by  e-mail to the last e-mail address you have provided us as soon as feasible  under the circumstances (delays in notification may occur while we take  necessary measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable  integrity to the system, as well as for the legitimate needs of law enforcement  if notification would impede a criminal investigation.)&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YOUR OPTIONS  &amp; OPT-OUTS</strong> <br>
  <strong>(a)&nbsp;W&nbsp;hat Information Can I Access?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>If you register as a (CouponCathy.net)&nbsp; member, you will typically have access to an  account section that includes the registration information you previously  provided which you can update or correct at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any inaccurate information  that you are not able to correct, just let us know.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, if you wish, you can delete your membership account entirely  although&nbsp;we may retain certain information in  limited circumstances – e.g., to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and  enforce our&nbsp;<u>Terms of Use</u>&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, some information is never  completely removed from our databases due to technical (e.g., information that  is stored in our “back-up” systems) and certain legal constraints.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  <strong>(b)  What Choices Do I Have (Opt-Out)?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>You  have many choices regarding how we use information about you, including: (1) To  stop our emails,&nbsp;<u><a href="http://couponcathy.net/opt-out/">click here</a></u>&nbsp;; (2) To opt-out of preference-based ads,&nbsp;<u><a href="http://couponcathy.net/opt-out/">click here</a>&nbsp;</u>; (3)&nbsp;To stop the sharing of PII with our  participating merchants,&nbsp;<u><a href="http://couponcathy.net/opt-out/">click here</a></u>&nbsp;; and  (4) as discussed above, the choices we offer you anytime you submit information  through our Sites or Services. </p>
