> The CouponSurfer.com mission is to simplify the shopping experience of on-line consumers by providing a dedicated web site of major brand promotions. Consumers view coupons at their convenience with an interactive easy-to-use format. CouponSurfer.com saves consumers time and money by eliminating the need for searching through newspapers or hundreds of web sites. 
> 
> To achieve this mission, we need to collect information to understand what products and services you are most interested in. We collect this information in two ways. 
> 
> First, you provide us with some basic information when you register. All of the information we collect, is 'aggregated', meaning that the information from many users is grouped together in a way that does not disclose the personal information of any particular user. We also sometimes receive updated email addresses from our trusted partners so that we can correct our records and communicate more easily (if you selected to receive emails). We use this aggregated information to provide you with the regional and national brand coupons you are interested in. CouponSurfer.com will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process. Please note that as CouponSurfer.com grows, we may sell or buy other companies or assets. In such transactions, customer information is typically one of the transferred assets. Also in the unlikely event that CouponSurfer, Inc. or it's assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets. 
> 
> Second, we may track your visit to our site by giving you a "cookie" when you enter. Cookies are pieces of information that Web sites transfer to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We use Cookies so that you won't have to re-enter your password and CouponSurfer ID when you visit CouponSurfer.com. Cookies are also used to track user trends and patterns. The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and you'll find them used on most major Web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you've received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that areas of certain sites will not function properly if you set your browser to not accept cookies. 
> 
> In addition when you become a member you can select whether to receive new coupon alerts emails and a CouponSurfer.com emails newsletter. Besides the user confirmation message, you will only receive email from CouponSurfer.com if you choose to receive new coupon alerts or the CouponSurfer.com.
