# CouponSurfer Privacy Policy

* * *

The CouponSurfer.com mission is to simplify the shopping experience of on-line consumers by providing a dedicated web site of major brand promotions. Consumers view coupons at their convenience with an interactive easy-to-use format. CouponSurfer.com saves consumers time and money by eliminating the need for searching through newspapers or hundreds of web sites.

To achieve this mission, we need to collect information to understand what products and services you are most interested in. We collect this information as specified below.

First, you provide us with some basic information when you register. All of the information we collect, is 'aggregated', meaning that the information from many users is grouped together in a way that does not disclose the personal information of any particular user. We also sometimes receive updated email addresses from our trusted partners so that we can correct our records and communicate more easily (if you selected to receive emails). We use this aggregated information to provide you with the regional and national brand coupons you are interested in. CouponSurfer.com will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process. Please note that as CouponSurfer.com grows, we may sell or buy other companies or assets. In such transactions, customer information is typically one of the transferred assets. Also in the unlikely event that CouponSurfer, Inc. or it's assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.

  * Use your transaction data to confirm a Qualifying Purchase or return to match transactions to confirm whether you qualify for a statement credit or an Offer;
  * May share transaction data with the participating merchant where a transaction occurred as needed for the merchant to confirm a specific transaction occurred or points should be awarded; for example, the date and amount of your purchase and the last 4 digits of your card number so the merchant can verify your purchase with its records if there is a missing or disputed transaction;
  * May provide participating merchants or Third Party Service Providers aggregated and anonymized information relating specifically to registered card activity solely to allow participating merchants and Third Party Service Providers to assess the results of their campaign;
  * Create a record of the transaction data and thereafter maintain and use data in connection with operating CouponSurfer.com platform;
  * Provide targeted offers that may be of interest to you;
  * Conducting analysis for the improvement and optimization of CouponSurfer.com platform; and
  * May provide information in order to respond to a request from government authority or a payment organization involved in a transaction with you or a merchant.

You may opt-out of transaction monitoring on the payment card(s) you have registered here.
