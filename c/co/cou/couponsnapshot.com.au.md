**Privacy Policy:**  
Personal Data  
Only a user's email address is collected when users provide registration to CouponSnapshot. You agree that CouponSnapshot may send you periodical emails promoting coupons and specials from the CouponSnapshot merchant base that may be of interest to you. All CouponSnapshot email newsletters can be opted out of by simply clicking on a link within each email to remove your email address from the list. Email addresses are never shared or sold to third-party marketers or third-party agencies.

Aggregated Information  
Aggregated information, such as which page users access or visit and information volunteered by users, is collected through various methods. For example, CouponSnapshot collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers (the computers that "serve up" Web pages) automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from CouponSnapshot, our servers log your IP address. CouponSnapshot only uses IP addresses for the purposes of web traffic analysis and trends. 

Use of Cookies  
CouponSnapshot also uses cookies to store information. A cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow CouponSnapshot to measure activity on the site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences.

Children and Privacy  
CouponSnapshot encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online, and to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children.

No information should be submitted to or posted on CouponSnapshot by users under the age of 13 years without the consent of their parent or guardian. CouponSnapshot does not provide any personally identifying information for users under the age of 13, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever unless disclosed during collection.
