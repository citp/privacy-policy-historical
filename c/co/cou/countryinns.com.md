believes in protecting your privacy. When we collect personal information from you -- whether online, over the phone or in person -- we follow the privacy principles of TRUSTe and the countries in which we do business. Carlson Hotels Worldwide also complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework administered by the Department of Commerce. These are our ten promises to you:

  1. **Notice.** Where we ask for your personal information, we'll tell you why we need your information, what we'll do with it and what options are available to you. 
  2. **Relevance.** We will require you to provide only those pieces of information that we need to perform the particular service you seek from us. 
  3. **Retention.** We will retain your information only so long as it is needed for business purposes or as required by law. 
  4. **Choice.** When we contact you for marketing purposes, we'll let you know how to remove your name from future marketing efforts. 
  5. **Access.** We will provide easy ways for you to access the information we've collected about you. 
  6. **Accuracy.** We will promptly correct inaccuracies in your personal information that we discover or you bring to our attention. 
  7. **Security.** We will follow generally accepted industry standards to protect your personal information during transmission and storage. 
  8. **Sharing.** When we share your information with other companies to help us provide our services to you, we will require them to comply with all applicable legal requirements regarding the privacy of your information. We will obtain your permission before sending your information outside of the Carlson Hotels Worldwide family of companies for purposes not related to the services we provide you. 
  9. **International Transfer.** If we send your information to one of our facilities in another country, we will protect it with the same high level of security. 
  10. **Enforcement.** We will regularly review how we're meeting these privacy promises and provide you a means to settle complaints about our privacy practices.
