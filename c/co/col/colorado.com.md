# Privacy Policy | Colorado.com

Your privacy is important to us. Much of the specific information requested within our site is voluntary and need not be submitted by the visitor. If personal information is submitted as part of a request for information, it is used to investigate or respond to the request. We may redirect your message to another government agency or person who is in a better position to meet your request. We do not release or sell information for the purpose of a third party's marketing program or solicitations.

Types of information collected on Colorado.com  
We collect personal data when you order our guides or sign up for our newsletter, which includes first and last name, email address and mailing address.

Navigation information  
Each time you visit Colorado.com, anonymous navigation information is collected by our servers. This information includes:  
• the type of browser and operating system you are using;  
• the address of the referring site (ie the previous site you had visited) and the website you leave our site to visit;  
• the date and time of your visit;  
• your server's IP address (a number which is unique to the machine); and  
• the address of the pages you accessed.

This provides Colorado.com with information about how the website is used and navigated, including the number of hits, the frequency of visits and the duration of visits to each page on the site. It does not personally identify individual users.

How we collect personal information off line  
Personal information will only be collected by lawful and fair means, for one or more specified purposes, which are relevant to Colorado.com's operations. When personal information is collected directly from the individual to whom it relates, the purpose of collection will be identified and it will only be collected with the person's consent.

Information collected on this site may also be combined and de-identified to provide Colorado.com with anonymous demographic and usage information. Colorado.com can then use this aggregated information to develop new and/or more appropriate content to our users.

In addition, anonymous navigation information may be used for statistical analysis of the site, for marketing purposes and to tailor the content of the site to the needs of Colorado.com users. Statistical information is not disclosed in connection with your personal information.

Cookies  
Currently Colorado.com does use "cookie" technology. Cookies were originally designed to help a website distinguish a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. A cookie is a small string of text that a website can send to your browser. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your email address.

We use cookies so that we can provide personalized information that we believe will be of value to you based on preferences you have indicated while visiting the site. You will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept the cookie. You may opt-out of these features here.

When we disclose personal information  
Colorado.com works with other companies that help us provide products and services to you and we may provide your personal information to these companies. For example, we give shipping companies this information so they can deliver your guide efficiently. In this case the information they receive is for shipping and delivery purposes only, and we require that the companies we contract with safeguard your personal information in accordance with Colorado.com's policies.

Personal information collected at this site will only be disclosed to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy and with the terms and conditions of any relevant service. You should check the terms and conditions of individual products and services for information about disclosures.

Security  
We make our best efforts to ensure that our systems are secure. Colorado.com safeguards the security of the data you provide to us with physical, electronic and managerial procedures.
