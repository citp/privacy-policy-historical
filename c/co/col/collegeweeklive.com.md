1\. Information We Collect   
In this Privacy Policy, we refer to the various types of information that you provide to us and that we collect or passively receive as the "Information."   


_Information You Provide Us_

When you register for CollegeWeekLive and at other times, you submit basic information such as your name, date of birth, gender, email address, phone number and physical address. Additionally, we may ask you to submit information related to your college plans, including without limitation, year of graduation, high school or college, major, GPA, standardized test scores and the like. Some information is mandatory to register with and use the Site; other information is optional. In addition, we may sometimes ask you to provide us with various information for other purposes, such as to enter contests or sweepstakes, or receive other products, information and features. 

**Social media information**   
We may use social media information so we can improve our member service and provide you more personalized offers and experiences. When you share social media information with us by connecting your social media account to our Site, you will be given a description of what may be collected. Each social network provides different types of information. For example, Facebook may provide your username, likes, public posts, and other basic data, while Twitter may offer your username, tweets, and basic profile. When you sign in to your account or mobile application with your social media account information, or otherwise connect to your social media account with the Services, you consent to our collection, storage, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, of the information that you choose to make available to us through the social media interface. Please see your social media provider's privacy policy and help and support features for more information about how they share information when you choose to connect your account. 

**User-generated Content**   
CollegeWeekLive may offer chat features, forums and message boards. Please be advised that information posted in these venues may become public knowledge, so do not post any information that might be sensitive, and please be careful with respect to what you choose to post publicly. 

_Information Collected Passively, Through Technology_

**Cookies and Web Beacons**   
We collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, when you visit our Site. The information we collect in this manner includes your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our Site (such as what pages you view, and what links you click on), and dates and times of Site visits. 

A cookie is a text file that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. A web beacon, also known as an Internet tag or pixel tag, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Using these tools, we obtain clickstream data, which is a log of the content you visit while browsing our Site. 

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can often change your browser settings to prevent these cookies from collecting your personal information. Disabling cookies does not necessarily disable the use of pixel tags, web beacons and other technologies that collect information about your use of the Site. 

**Locally Stored Objects**   
The Services may employ locally stored objects ("LSOs") and other client-side storage tracking technologies in certain situations where they help to provide a better user experience, such as to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies, or in order to target ads, analyze ad performance, or perform user, website, or market analytics. For LSOs utilized by Adobe Flash you can access Flash management tools from [Adobe's website](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html) directly. In addition, some, but not all browsers, provide the ability to remove LSOs, sometimes within cookie and privacy settings.
