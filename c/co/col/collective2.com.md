**What This Privacy Policy Covers**

This policy covers how Collective2 treats personal information that Collective2 collects and receives. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, IP address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Collective2 does not own or control, or to people that Collective2 does not employ or manage.

Collective2 collects personal information when you register with Collective2, and when you use Collective2 products or services. When you register we ask for information such as your name and email address. Once you register with Collective2 and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. Collective2 collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about trading advice you subscribe to. Collective2 automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Collective2 cookie information, and the page you request. Collective2 uses this information to customize the content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.
