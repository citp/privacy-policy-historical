We may share all categories of your personal information to selected outside companies, either by selling it or otherwise transferring it, to advertisers and other business partners that assist us in providing you with meaningful and relevant Services (each, collectively an “Advertiser”). Our Advertisers include realtors, loan providers and other complementary service companies, schools, and work places. The sharing of your personal information with these Advertisers is conducted in accordance with the contact preferences that you set when you create your user profile, or when you express an interest in any content displayed on our Site, or when you enter a response to any affirmative authorization that you provide by typing it in a space provided or clicking on an icon designed to show your interest in an item on the web page or in the app.  In certain cases, we may ask on behalf of an Advertiser that you have expressed an interest in for your express written consent to receive marketing autodialed or pre-recorded calls or text messages at a phone number you designate.  Your consent to such requests is not required as a condition for use of the Niche Services and you can opt out from such calls or texts at any time by following the instructions in such calls or text messages, or by contacting the particular Advertiser directly.  Standard message and data rates may apply to calls or texts based on your plan.

In addition, any personal information you share publicly through our Site may be indexed through third party search engines, such as Google or Bing. We do not control the practices of third party search engines, and they may use caches containing your information, including any outdated information. You acknowledge that personal information that you submit when you participate in an opinion survey or user review, a blog or any online message board that we provide through our Site or Services may be available, via the Internet, around the world. We cannot prevent the use (or misuse) of such personal information by others, nor can we ensure it is deleted if you later ask us to delete your personal information as provided for in this Policy. 

**B. _Third party processors:_**

These Processors need access to and use of your personal information, and include third parties to provide us with technical support, to give us additional personal data about you, and to perform analytics and other work that we may need to outsource. These Processors are bound by law and/or contract to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information.  They only process your personal information to provide requested services for us, and only act on our documented instructions.

We also share all categories of your personal information with other business partners that perform certain functions for us (“Business Partners”).  These Business Partners are themselves responsible to determine the purposes and/or means of the processing your personal information and for the lawfulness of that processing.  They include insurance companies, financial institutions, and other professional advisors.

We provide links to other websites, such as social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter and Google), or our third party partner websites (such as scholarship providers, schools, and Business Partners), and these other websites may provide links to our Site. Third party sites operate according to their own terms of use and privacy policies and Niche has no control over these third party websites. ** _If you wish to opt-out of any information sharing conducted by any third party website that you link to from us, or to us from them, you must do so in accordance with their specific opt-out policies and procedures._** **_By using our Site and Services, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability of such third-party sites, and do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites.

We also share aggregated or de-identified information (i.e., information that does not personally identify you directly), or statistical information about you, including statistical data and historical use data, with others for a variety of purposes, including for their own uses, for example, for improving their services for you and others. 

**E. _As required by law or legitimate business interest_ : **

In addition, we may disclose any or all categories of your personal information where such disclosure is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person. Likewise, we may disclose all such categories of your personal information to our professional advisers as is reasonably necessary for the purposes of managing risks, obtaining professional advice, or the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure. Further, we may share some or all of your personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger or similar transaction involving sale or transfer of some or all of our business or assets. If another company acquires our company or assets, that company will possess the personal information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

You have the right to request that we do not sell your personal information to Advertisers. If, at some point after giving us your personally identifiable information, you wish to limit the sale of your information to our third party Advertisers, or you no longer desire to continue to receive additional information from us about Niche and our Advertisers, you may have the ability to “opt out” by emailing support@niche.com and putting the words “remove my name” in the subject line of your email. In the case of our email newsletters, you may opt out by clicking on the “opt out” link at the end of each email. If you agree to receive autodialed or pre-recorded calls and/or text messages from an Advertiser and later wish to opt-out, you should follow the direction in such call(s) or text message(s) or contact the school or other Advertiser directly.

Please note, you cannot opt out of our sharing of your personal information with our Processors or Business Partners, or our sharing of deidentified information, or your personal information as required by law or legitimate business interests, as described in Sections III. B., D., and E. above. Also, if you opt out of receiving marketing-related emails from us, we may still send you important administrative messages, from which you cannot opt out.
