## Web Site Users and Customers

College Prowler generally collects personally identifiable information such as a name, postal address, E-mail address, telephone number, or credit card information with your specific knowledge and consent.

### How does the Web site use information supplied by me?

Occasionally, visitors to our Web site may be asked to supply certain personally identifying information, which is then retained by College Prowler. For example, we ask you for certain information if you choose to subscribe to our E-mail newsletters, our online discussion forums, or our premium online content. If you choose to give us personally identifying information at such time, such information will be retained by us and used only to provide you with products or services you have requested, or with additional information from College Prowler about College Prowler, its affiliates, or selected outside companies whose products or services we feel may be of use to you. Any information from selected outside companies will be transmitted by College Prowler so that such companies will not have access either to your E-mail address or to your other personally identifying information. Moreover, we will not sell or rent this personally identifying information to any other company or organization.

If, at some point after giving College Prowler your personally identifying information, you do not wish to continue to receive additional information from College Prowler about College Prowler, its affiliates, or selected outside companies, in general, you may opt out by E-mailing [support@collegeprowler.com](mailto:support@collegeprowler.com) and put the words "remove my name" in the subject line of your E-mail; in the case of our E-mail newsletters, you may opt out by clicking on the "opt out" link at the end of each E-mail.

From time to time, the personally identifying information that you provide to us may be shared with our suppliers or service providers who assist us in maintaining and managing our newsletters, our archives, our premium online content, our online discussion forums, and other activities on the Web site. Such suppliers or service providers may use your personally identifying information only in the course of providing services to College Prowler, but they may not use such information for other purposes.

While your individual information is protected as discussed above, College Prowler reserves the right to use such individual information to create aggregated, anonymous data about users in order to develop statistics about activity on and visitors to the Web site.

From time to time, College Prowler is approached by third parties interested in contacting our readers, or people who have purchased a book through our site. Perhaps they are in a similar business or have a product to offer that would interest our subscribers. We may provide our mailing list of readers to such third parties if we believe our readers would be interested in hearing from them. Many of our readers find this a valuable and timesaving service. If you have bought a guide from us and want us to exclude your name from mailing lists provided to third parties, mail a letter to the address below, or E-mail us at the address below with your request. Please specify that you would like your name removed from the mailing list, and include your full name and address or the address label from your magazine.

Educational institutions use Collegeprowler.com student data in their recruitment efforts, but the Website is not an application tool. All Collegeprowler.com users must still perform the institution appropriate application process as the Website does not replace the application process.
