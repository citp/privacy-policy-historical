## College Prowler Customers

From time to time, College Prowler is approached by third parties interested in contacting our readers, people who have purchased a book through our site or a premium online service. Perhaps they are in a similar business or have a product to offer that would interest our subscribers. We may provide our mailing list of readers to such third parties if we believe our readers would be interested in hearing from them. Many of our readers find this a valuable and timesaving service. If you have bought a guide from us and want us to exclude your name from mailing lists provided to third parties, mail a letter to the address below, or E-mail us at the address below with your request. Please specify that you would like your name removed from the mailing list, and include your full name and address or the address label from your magazine. Mail your request to: College Prowler, Mailing List, Pittsburgh, PA. 15213 or send an E-mail to support@collegeprowler.com. Please allow six to eight weeks for your request to take effect.

If in limited circumstances we do knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, we will do so only with verified parental consent prior to collection. In the event that we learn that we have collected information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete this information from our database as quickly as possible. If you believe the Web site has any information about anyone under 13, please contact us at support@collegeprowler.com.
