Privacy  
 **Do you sell or trade customer e-mail addresses?**  
No. We never sell, rent, or trade e-mail addresses.

We do occasionally share names and mailing addresses with other reliable companies. If you prefer that we not share your name or mailing address, please call 1-800-510-2808. Our customer service representatives are available daily from 6 a.m. to 3 a.m. ET.

**Does Coldwater Creek acquire names and addresses?**  
Yes. We may acquire names and addresses from third parties.

**What kind of information will I be asked to provide?**  
When you place an order, request e-mail updates, request a catalog, or participate in a promotion, contest or survey, we may ask for some or all of the following: your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. If placing an order, we may ask for credit card information.

We maintain a record of your online, catalog and store purchases. If you ship your order to an address different from your billing address, we will ask you to enter the Ship To name and address. If you use Send-a-Hint, you will be asked for the e-mail address of the recipient. If you use Send-a-Hint or send an electronic gift card to someone, you will be asked for the e-mail address of the recipient. We never use these e-mail addresses for any other purpose.

**How will Coldwater Creek use the information I provide?**  
Your information is used to process and deliver your order to the address you request. Your payment information allows us to bill your credit card company. If we have any questions regarding your order, we will contact you by phone or e-mail. If you make a purchase, we may send you information and updates about new products, special sales and promotions. We use both e-mail and postal addresses to share information with our customers. When you supply e-mail addresses in Send-a-Hint or to send an electronic gift card, we use those addresses only for the purpose you intend.

We often use testimonials from our customers in printed material or on our website, but only when we have express permission to do so. Testimonials come from customer comments sent or e-mailed directly to us.

We occasionally share customer information with select third parties. From time to time we provide aggregate, statistical information about consumers and sales on our website and site shopping information. These statistics are used in communications, such as our annual report, and do not identify individuals.

**Do I need a password to order from Coldwatercreek.com?**  
No. However, you may find it more convenient if you sign up for an account with us. In your account we can store your name, address and credit card information so you don't have to enter that information during future shopping visits. Only the last four digits of your credit card numbers are displayed for easy identification.

**How do I update my personal information?**  
You can update your information online in [My Account](https://web.archive.org/MyAccount/MyAcctLogin.aspx). Log in with your e-mail address and password, then click Personal Information. Your account information will be displayed as we currently have it in our system. If you have any difficulties, click Live Help or give us a call at 1-800-510-2808. Our customer service representatives are available daily from 6 a.m. to 3 a.m. ET.

**Does Coldwater Creek use of third party service providers?**  
Yes. We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on Coldwatercreek.com. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, e-mail address, or any personally identifying information about the user. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third party service provider, please [click here](http://acerno.com/privacy.html).

You can also read more about online marketing practices and the technologies that support them by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s website by [clicking here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

**How do I discontinue promotional e-mails?**  
At the bottom of each e-mail is information about removing your name from our e-mail list. You may also remove your name or change the frequency of the e-mails you receive in My Account. Log in with your e-mail address and password. Select E-mail & Password Information. On the next screen, make your selection, then save your changes. Our promotions are prepared in advance, so it may take a few days for the change to take effect, and you may receive e-mails during that time.

After you make a purchase, for your convenience we will still send e-mail order confirmations and information about your order. We may also contact you by phone or mail if we have questions regarding your order.

Security  
 **How do I know Coldwatercreek.com is a secure site?**  
We use state-of-the-art technology to encrypt your personal and financial information before it is sent. The ordering area of our site is protected this way and is referred to as "secure."

**Does Coldwatercreek.com use SSL technology?**  
Yes. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology is the gold standard in Internet encryption. This highly sophisticated system scrambles your financial data as it travels from your computer to our website, making it useless to anyone but Coldwatercreek.com.

**How do I know when I am in secure mode?**  
If you look at the website address in your browser window, non-secure sections of our site begin with "http://." When you move to a secure area, the address changes to "https://"; the "s" means secure. You'll also see a lock displayed in the lower right-hand corner.

If for any reason you cannot access a secure area of our site to place your order, please call 1-800-510-2808. Our customer service representatives are available daily from 6 a.m. to 3 a.m. ET.

**What if an unauthorized purchase occurs?**  
We will cover any liability imposed on you by your bank or credit card company, up to $50, in the unlikely event that your card is used without your authorization at Coldwatercreek.com. We will also do whatever we can to help resolve the situation. The Fair Credit Billing Act requires your bank or credit card company to hold you responsible for no more than $50 of unauthorized or fraudulent charges on a credit card. Most debit card issuers voluntarily adopt the same liability limitations as credit card issuers, but you may want to check with your bank to make sure. Remember: if unauthorized use of your credit or debit card does occur, it is your responsibility to notify your card provider as stated in your agreement with them.

**Is Live Help a secure area of Coldwatercreek.com?**  
No. Live Help is a chat-like feature on our site. It allows you to have questions answered online by one of our customer service representatives while you are shopping. It is not a secure area and, to protect your online security, a customer service representative will never ask you for credit card information during an online conversation in Live Help.

**What about spam?**  
Like hundreds of other companies, Coldwater Creek, Inc. has been the target of a spam e-mail campaign on the Internet; e-mail that is sent illegally and illegitimately to the mass public. The senders create enticing subject lines to make the recipient think the e-mail message is from or has something to do with a legitimate company or organization, when in reality, the sender has nothing to do with the legitimate company. Specifically, a spam e-mail circulated on the Internet that contained the subject line:

> **Coldwater Creek Order Number X11131080000**

The body of the message varied, but often included a link to a website selling products completely unrelated to Coldwater Creek, Inc.

We want our customers and the general public to know this spam did NOT originate from or was sent by Coldwater Creek, Inc. We go to great lengths to ensure our customers’ privacy, the integrity of Coldwater Creek, Inc. and our brand.

We advise anyone receiving a spam e-mail to report it as abuse to their Internet Service Providers.
