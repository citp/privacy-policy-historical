This Policy will also inform you what to do if you do not want your Personal Information to be shared or divulged when you visit our Websites or respond to our advertising. 

We do not attempt to collect excessive or irrelevant information, whether that information personally identifies you or not. We collect information solely for the purposes stated below. We will take reasonable steps to delete or de-identify information about you that we collect when it is no longer needed to interact with you. You agree that until you notify us by following the instructions under the "Opt-out" section below, or we determine that the information is no longer needed, we may retain the information indefinitely.

### PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND WHAT WE DO WITH IT

Coleman will not collect any Personal Information about you (i.e., your name, address, telephone number, or email address) unless you provide it voluntarily. If you do not want your Personal Information collected do not submit it to us. 

If you do submit Personal Information we will store and process that information to better understand your needs, offer certain products and services in connection with our Websites, communicate to you, provide customer service, provide a personalized shopping experience, prevent fraud, fulfill your orders (including delivery and billing), complete payment method processing, and improve our products and services. 

We will not distribute or sell your Personal Information to any outside company for the marketing or solicitation of any product not affiliated with Coleman and your Personal Information will only be used to support your relationship with Coleman and its partners. In each case, the outside company is under agreement with Coleman to protect your Personal Information and to use it solely as Coleman directs. 

There are certain limited instances where we may disclose or transfer Personal Information other than as described above. For example, we may provide such information to appropriate authorities if we believe in good faith that the law requires it or to protect our legal rights or property. Additionally, as we continue to develop our business, we may buy or sell business assets. In such transactions, customer information is generally one of the transferred business assets. However, we are not in the business of selling customer information to others, and aside from certain exceptional circumstances, we will take appropriate measures to ensure the protection of the information you provide to us. 

### AGGREGATING THIRD PARTY INFORMATION WITH PERSONAL INFORMATION

We may, either through our own searches or by contact with third party providers, add publicly available information to the Personal Information you elect to provide to us.

### INFORMATION WE COLLECT THROUGH AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES

In general, you can visit our Websites and view content while remaining anonymous by not providing any Personal Information.

Examples of this type of information include the internet browser you are using, the type of operating system, the domain name of the website which linked you to our site, the pages you visited while you were using our Websites, the domain name of the website you next go to, and your Internet Protocol address. When collected, we use non-personally identifiable information to determine the overall reaction to various sections of our Websites (the length and frequency of stays at our Websites and the variety of searches of our Website databases), measure the effectiveness and usefulness of various pages (how our Websites are navigated, how many visitors arrive at specific pages), and to improve the flow and interconnectivity of the Websites.

### HOW WE PROTECT THE SECURITY OF YOUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The security of your financial information is very important to us. In our efforts to protect your online transactions, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of (SSL) (and most are), your financial information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet. 

Our Websites have also obtained digital certificates from Verisign, Inc., a leading provider of internet trust services. When you enter a secure portion of our site (which is any page containing any of your financial information), an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small popup window displaying site-security information will appear. The certificate guarantees that your financial information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form to our Websites’ web server, not to some unknown or unauthorized server. 

Ultimately, your financial information is protected by the password you create when you create an account on any of our Websites. Please keep this password confidential. No Customer Service Associate or any other representative of Coleman will ever ask you for your password. The confidentiality of your password is yours to protect. You may change it anytime by going to the "[My Account](https://www.coleman.com/order-history/) " section on any of our Websites. Log in with your email address and password, then click "Continue" and enter a new password.
