            	<p>We will describe here how CollegeDegrees.com collects and utilizes the personal information that users like you provide on our website: CollegeDegrees.com.</p>
<p>Information that we may collect from you as you browse and use CollegeDegrees.com include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your contact Information, such as your name, email and mailing addresses, and home or mobile phone number. </li>
<li>Your demographic information, such as the year you expect to graduate, education level, gender, academic or personal interests, and zip code.</li>
</ul>
<p>CollegeDegrees.com, like most websites, may also record information about your technical settings, such as browser type, IP address, referring and exit pages, and operating system. </p>
<p>We use this data to improve your user experience by: </p>
<ul>
<li>Determining and recommending which online college degree programs that might be suitable for you so that we may provide you with the information you may need to reach your career goals.</li>
<li>Using the data to determine how you can obtain a high-quality, real-world education at your own pace and schedule.</li>
<li>Sending you any school information you may have requested. </li>
<li>Responding efficiently to customer service requests.</li>
<li>Sending you a newsletter. </li>
<li>Sending you relevant marketing communications. </li>
<li>Responding to your submitted questions and concerns. </li>
<li>Improving CollegeDegree.com and its marketing efforts, or otherwise assessing the demands of our business.</li>
<li>Conducting research and analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Choosing to Opt-Out </h4>
<p>If you would prefer to not receive marketing information from us, simply follow the instructions included in the emails to unsubscribe from future correspondence. </p>
<h4>Sharing Your Information </h4>
<p> We will not and do not sell personal information to third party companies for their unrelated marketing purposes. The only ways we will share your personal information with third party companies are in the manners that are described in this privacy statement. </p>
<p>An example of how we may share your information is that we may provide it to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities, such as offering customer service or email service delivery. In submitting your personal information on CollegeDegrees.com, you are making an “inquiry” to us, our affiliated entities, and third party marketing partners/vendors, which grants permission to be contacted via email, mail, and phone — you will be consenting to receive telephone calls for a limited period from our affiliates and partners/vendors, even if the telephone number you submitted appears on a state and/or federal Do Not Call list. This is because your inquiry will serve as an exception to state and/or federal Do Not Call requirements.ÿ</p>
<p>In addition, your personal information may be shared to comply with the law, such as in the case of a subpoena or similar legal process when we believe that the disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, your safety or the safety of others, or investigate fraud. It may also be done to respond to a government request if CollegeDegrees.com becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets to any other third party, with your prior consent to do so.</p>
<h4>Privacy Policy Change Notification </h4>
<p>To reflect changes to our information practices, we may update this policy. For this reason, we encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. </p>
<h4>Contact Information </h4>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please use our contact form. </p>
