**Online Identification Tools:**   
Similar to many other website providers, we use your IP address to help diagnose potential problems with our server and provide you with a better online-shopping experience. We use your IP address to help identify you and your shopping cart and gather Online Information.

We also use web beacons to personalize your experience of the Service and to generate information about Service traffic and trends. Web beacons collect Online Information, such as your IP address and the type of browser that you use. Web beacons may be used alone or in conjunction with cookies; when web beacons are used with cookies, they may link Online Information to other Personal Information that you have provided to us. Web beacons are not typically visible to you.

We use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and for other purposes such as personalizing the Service. We collect this type of information to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor your experience with us. A cookie is a small file stored by your Internet browser on your computer. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. Your web browser is usually set up to initially accept cookies. If you set your browser to reject cookies, the Service will not be able to recognize your account or to personalize the content that you see. Please note that we do not and cannot use cookies to gather other information that may be stored on your hard drive.

We may use Google Analytics or other analytical tools provided by third parties. Third-party advertising management partners may help us display tailored content to our customers’ interests and serve interest-based advertising on our behalf. **Renegade Furniture Group** and our advertising management partners may use cookies, web beacons, and other tools to collect Online Information about your activities on the Service, to deliver advertising on the Service, or elsewhere on the Internet based upon your interests that may be more relevant to you and to measure effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the Service.

In particular, **Renegade Furniture Group** may use Google Analytics to monitor activity on the Site and assist with advertising. To learn how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit: “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” located at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners "Google Policies").   
You may "opt out" of receiving some interest-based advertisements by copying this link https://preferences.boomtrain.com/preferences/3858/users?email=< **INSERT YOUR EMAIL** >, and by submitting your email/emails that you would like to be unsubscribed. (For example, https://preferences.boomtrain.com/preferences/3858/users? email=< **INSERT YOUR EMAIL** >.)

You may also unsubscribe from receiving some internet-based advertisements by selecting the unsubscribe hyperlink attached within the email. Please note that unsubscribing (via either of the above methods) does not apply to transaction-related emails.

Also, you may opt out of certain interest-based advertisements that use **Renegade Furniture Group** cookie by clearing your browser’s stored cookies.

Please note that by opting out of receiving interest-based advertisements through the links above does not mean you will no longer see digital advertisements from **Renegade Furniture Group** or our ad management partners; rather, opting out means that most of the digital advertisements that you do see will not be based on your particular interests. In addition, certain data collection tools on the Service still may collect information about your use of the Service, such as for fraud prevention and analytics.

**How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals: **   
Some web browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") that signals to websites that a user does not want his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser's user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many digital service operators, including **Renegade Furniture Group** , do not recognize or respond to DNT signals.

**Third Party Features: **   
The Service also may include an activity feed, social media buttons and widgets, such as the Pinterest or Facebook "Like" button or the "Share” button. These features may collect and display your Personal Information, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Please not that these features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Service and your interactions with them are governed by the privacy policy of the third party that provides the feature.

**How We Use, Process, and Disclose Personal Information: **   
**Renegade Furniture Group** does not disclose, rent, or sell, your Personal Information to third parties, except as specified in this Policy, without your prior consent. **Renegade Furniture Group** may, however, use, process and disclose Personal Information to facilitate and:

In the event that a division, part, or all of **Renegade Furniture Group** (or the assets of a **Renegade Furniture Group** entity) is bought, sold or otherwise transferred, or is in the process of a potential transaction, customer Personal Information will likely be shared during the evaluation process and included among the transferred business assets.

**Information Sharing for Marketing Purposes:**   
Similar to many other companies, to provide you with the information about our products and services that may be most useful to you, we may partner with select reputable organizations whose privacy policies we believe are consistent with ours. Such organizations may include other retailers and magazine publishers. Through these arrangements, we may share, exchange, cross-reference and/or rent your name and mailing address.

Anyone who receives an email invitation to use the Service may opt out of receiving such emails in the future by following the opt-out instructions in the email.

**Information Security**   
We have instituted commercially reasonable safeguards to help ensure that information collected is secure.

When you send or otherwise transmit your sensitive information (such as your credit card number) to or though the Sites, your sensitive information is encrypted and protected with SSL, the current industry-standard encryption protocol. When you are on an SSL-protected page, a picture of a closed lock appears at the bottom or top of some web browsers. Another way to tell if you are on a secure page is to check the URL or address of the page. These secure SSL-encrypted pages have URLs that start with "https://" instead of "http://". Please understand, however, despite these safeguards and our efforts, that it may be still possible for third parties to access information. Without limiting the terms of our Terms of Use and this Policy, you understand that we do not guarantee that your use of the Site and/or information provided by you will be private or secure and we are not responsible or liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience. You are fully responsible for taking reasonable precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the Site. You also understand that any information provided by you or collected by us or our agents in connection with your use of the Site will be used in the manner described in our Terms of Use. Please do not use the Site if you do not agree to the terms and conditions described in this Information Security section. If you have any questions about security of the Site, please [contact us here](https://colemanfurniture.com/contact-us "Contact Us").

**Changes to our Privacy Policy**   
We may occasionally update this Policy to reflect changes in our practices. When we post modifications to this Policy, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this web page.

The modified Policy will be effective immediately upon posting on the Service. Your continued use of the Service after the posting of the modified Policy constitutes your agreement to abide and be bound by it.

If we make a substantially material change, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Service prior to the change becoming effective.
