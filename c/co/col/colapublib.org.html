<p><font size="4"><b>DISCLAIMER</b></font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The County of Los Angeles Public Library endeavors to 
develop and support collections, resources, and services that meet the 
informational, educational and recreational needs of a highly diverse public. 
The Library utilizes ever-expanding technology and information networks.  
The County of Los Angeles Public Library does not monitor and has no control 
over the information accessed through the Internet and cannot be held 
responsible for its content.  As with other Library materials and services, 
restriction of access to the Internet is the responsibility of the individual, 
or, as in the case of a child, the parent/guardian.</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b></font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County recognizes 
the public's concern about privacy on the Internet. This privacy statement 
establishes how information gathered about you from your visit to our Website 
will be used by this Website's operators. As a visitor, however, you should 
be aware that much information submitted to the County of Los Angeles Public 
Library is public information under the laws of the State of California. 
Under some circumstances, we may be required to disclose such information 
in accordance with the California Public Records Act or other legal 
requirements.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The following describes how information may be collected 
depending on your activities at this Website:</p>

<b></b><p><b>If you read or download information</b>:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We may collect and store information for statistical 
purposes. For example, we may count the number of visitors to the different 
sections of our site to help us make them more useful. The information 
collected may include such items as the name and domain of the host from 
which you access the Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the 
computer you are using or your browser software and operating system. This 
information does not identify you personally.</p>

<b></b><p><b>If you send E-mail to this Website:</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">By sending us an electronic mail message, you may be 
sending us personal information (i.e., your name, address, e-mail address, 
etc.). We may store the name and address of the requester in order to 
respond to the request or otherwise resolve the subject matter of your 
e-mail. You should know that e-mail is not necessarily secure against 
interception and may be subject to the disclosure requirements of the 
Public Records Act or other legal disclosure requirements.</p>

<b><p>If you register with a County department or agency or request other 
specific information:</p></b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The County of Los Angeles Public Library may ask 
visitors who request specific information to fill out a registration form. 
For example, customers asking for assistance with a reference question or 
placing a request for library materials, or those submitting e-mail via 
our "feedback form" may be asked to provide their names, addresses, e-mail 
addresses and other pertinent information to ensure we can process and 
deliver the information requested. Other information may be collected at 
these sites through questionnaires, feedback forms or other means to enable 
us to determine a visitor's interests with the goal of providing better 
service.</p>

<b><p>Privacy Statements for other County departmental or agency Websites</p></b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This privacy statement describes the information-gathering 
practices and procedures of the County of Los Angeles Public Library; however, 
the domain is made up of many departmental and agency Websites linked together 
to provide a comprehensive information resource to our residents. Accordingly, 
each department or agency Website within the domain of the County of Los 
Angeles has posted specific information concerning its information-gathering 
practices. You may review the privacy statement for each Website within this 
domain by selecting the "Privacy" icon on the navigation bar of each page.</p>

<b><p>Links to non-Los Angeles County (third party) Websites:</p></b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Our Website also contains links to information located on 
Websites maintained by other public agencies and private organizations. 
Once you access an individual document that links you to another Website, 
you are subject to the privacy policy of the Website containing that 
document.</p>

<b><p>Getting Access to Information and Providing Corrections:</p></b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If you want to get information about you that may be 
in our records, the California Public Records Act provides you with 
certain rights to this information. Contact this department through the 
e-mail address / telephone number noted on our website and make a specific 
request for a copy of the information we have received online from you 
and have stored. If you find this information is inaccurate or incomplete, 
you may provide us with verified accurate and complete information.</p>

<b><p>No use of "cookies":</p></b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We do not use "cookies" on this site. A "cookie" is a 
small text file that a Website can place on your computer's hard drive to 
collect information about your activities on the site. The "cookie" transmits 
this information back to the Website's computer, which, generally speaking, 
is the only computer that can read it. Most users do not know that 
"cookies" are being placed on their computers. If you want to know 
when this happens or to prevent it from happening, you can set your browser 
to warn you when a Website attempts to place a "cookie" on your computer.</p>
