**About CollabNet**

CollabNet provides companies with solutions for Collaborative Software Development (CSD) by combining a Web-based software application with a suite of consulting services. The benefits of CSD are discussed in an upcoming CollabNet Web seminar series, [click here](https://web.archive.org/special/clickseminars.html) for more information.

Using these solutions, customers can collaborate on development projects within an enterprise, with customers, business partners, or with third party developers. CollabNet enables corporations to reduce costs and increase revenues by bringing different project team members together, regardless of their location.

CollabNet is currently working with several Fortune 500 and industry-leading enterprise companies, including: Barclays Global Investors (BGI), Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein (DrKW), Hewlett-Packard (HP), Oracle, and Sun Microsystems. Brian Behlendorf, co-founder of the Apache Software Foundation, established CollabNet in July 1999.
