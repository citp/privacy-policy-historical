## Your Choices About Receiving E-Mail

CollabNet makes every effort to provide you with the ability to opt-in and opt-out of receiving communications from CollabNet and/or its partners.

CollabNet may send you e-mail about your account, about the products you have downloaded and/or purchased, to remind you about a webcast for which you have registered or a service you have purchased, or in response to your questions. If you choose to receive it, CollabNet may send you our technical newsletter and other related technical information. CollabNet may also send you e-mail with information and/or special offers about products and services that may be of interest to you if you have opted in to such communications. In addition, with your assent, our business partners may send you such information.

You may let us know whether or not you would like to receive information, special offers, and promotional materials from CollabNet or our business partners when you create a CollabNet Community account, when you register for a service, when you provide us with your personal information, or when we send you e-mail. You may also update these choices in your registration profile at any time. Please note that if you choose not to accept promotional e-mails, you may not receive special offers that may be of value to you.

CollabNet will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of the newsletter or any of our direct marketing communications at any time. All newsletters and promotional e-mail sent from CollabNet will contain a provision allowing you the option to decline receiving future e-mail. You may unsubscribe to an e-mail communication by contacting CollabNet at [unsubscribe@collab.net](mailto:unsubscribe@collab.net) and requesting that you be unsubscribed from that specific communication.

## Cookies and Other Browser Information

Our Site uses certain "cookies" and other tracking technologies. These technologies allow us to remember your interests as expressed by the pages you visit on our Site and to allow the Site to "remember" your login information to facilitate automatic logins (if desired). A cookie is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about your activities on our Site. The cookie transmits this information back to our Site's computer that, generally speaking, is the only computer that can read it. Some cookies may serve to recall Personal Information previously registered by you. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. You can also set your browser to block or remove cookies; however, if you choose to do so, certain features and functionality of our Websites may no longer be available to you.

## Data Security

We utilize appropriate physical, procedural and technological security measures reasonably designed to help protect your personal information against unauthorized access or disclosure. However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusions by third parties. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any incidentally-collected personal information you choose to store in the Site are maintained at levels of protection to meet specific needs or obligations you may have relating to that information.

CollabNet trains its employees on our privacy policy guidelines and makes our privacy policy available to our business partners. Our website uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts your credit card information when you send it to our Site. In addition, CollabNet and its business partners enter into confidentiality agreements which require that appropriate care and precautions be taken to prevent loss, misuse, or disclosure of your personal information.

## Public Forums Reminder

This site often makes discussion forums, mailing lists, wikis, blogs and chat rooms available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. Although we value individual ideas and encourage free expression, CollabNet reserves the right to take necessary action to preserve the forum's integrity, such as removing any posting that is inappropriate. Any communications sent to you by third parties are the responsibility of such third parties.

## Our Commitment to Children's Online Privacy

Out of special concern for children's privacy, CollabNet does not knowingly accept online personal information from children under the age of 13. CollabNet does not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to become registered members of our sites, or buy products and services on our sites. CollabNet does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13.

In the event that CollabNet ever decides to expand its intended site audience to include children under the age of 13, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice addressed to children under 13. In addition, CollabNet will provide an appropriate mechanism to obtain parental approval, allow parents to subsequently make changes to or request removal of their children's personal information, and provide access to any other information as required by law.
