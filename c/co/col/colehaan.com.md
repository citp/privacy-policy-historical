### Privacy Policy

Cole Haan is committed to respecting the privacy rights of all visitors to our web site. The following policy describes how Cole Haan collects, protects and uses information we receive from visitors to our web site.

#### What information does Cole Haan collect and how does Cole Haan use it?

When you register on our web site, we need you to provide your name, e-mail address, mailing address, day phone number and credit card information (when ordering products only), as well as create a username and password. This allows us to keep a user profile so that we may customize preferences for each specific user, as well as provide a faster method for users to submit information to Cole Haan, and receive back either the information or products desired.

When you register, we also allow you the discretion whether or not to submit your evening phone number, date of birth, and gender. This allows us to better know our visitors and possibly tailor any specific features, promotions, or other notifications to you.

Visitors will also be given a choice when registering whether they would like to be on Cole Haan's mailing list, or whether they would prefer to opt-out and not receive such mailings from Cole Haan.

Our web site contains an anonymous shopping feature whereby visitors who desire to purchase products can elect not to register. Those who elect to purchase products without registering will be asked only for information necessary to process the transaction. Information provided by anonymous shoppers will be retained only as necessary to process the transaction and maintain Cole Haan's sales records and will not be used for marketing purposes.

When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, Cole Haan may again ask for your name, address, e-mail address, username and password so that we are able to better administer the contest and notify winners.

We may also use the information we collect during the registration process to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the web site, new Cole Haan services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, or would like to opt-out of any other information request or distribution, simply reply to any Cole Haan e-mail sent to you and type UNSUBSCRIBE as the subject of your reply. Cole Haan does not collect any navigational information from customers.

#### How does Cole Haan protect visitor information?

Cole Haan implements a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. User personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information supplied by users is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into Cole Haan's databases to be only accessed as stated above.

#### Does Cole Haan use "cookies"?

Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help Cole Haan conduct and improve its business. Coremetrics is a third-party service provider that Cole Haan works with to help analyze and improve how visitors interact with our website and services. They use cookies to gather anonymous data about our visitors on Cole Haan's behalf. They do not collect personally identifiable information like email, credit card number, phone number, or name. If you would rather not take part in this ongoing research and analysis then please feel free to click here to opt out of Coremetrics. 

#### Does Cole Haan disclose the information we collect from our visitors to outside parties?

Cole Haan does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice, except as described below. The term "outside parties" does not include NIKE, Inc. wholly-owned companies. It also does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting Cole Haan's business, or servicing you as long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or other rights or safety. This information is also used to better understand visitors' use of Cole Haan's web site and to support related transactions made on the web site.

However, this data in an aggregate form may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. Cole Haan may also use e-mail addresses and other personally identifiable information to contact visitors who communicate with us. For example, we direct e-mail to visitors who provide us with their e-mail addresses for specific purposes such as receiving our e-mail newsletters or being notified if they have won one of our contests. Each e-mail newsletter always contains instructions on how to discontinue receipt of the newsletter. However, if a visitor at anytime chooses to no longer receive such information and opt-out from any future mailings, they should simply reply to any Cole Haan e-mail sent to them and type UNSUBSCRIBE as the subject of their reply.

#### How does a visitor opt-out, remove, or modify information they have provided to Cole Haan?

After gathering any user information, Cole Haan offers users the opportunity to remove their information from our database so as not to receive future communications or to no longer interact with the web site until they later choose to by e-mailing membersupdate@colehaan.com and asking that their information be deleted. Cole Haan additionally provides users the opportunity to update and modify any information they have previously provided by e-mailing us at membersupdate@colehaan.com and asking to update and/or modify the information previously provided. 

#### Third party links

In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, Cole Haan may choose various third party web sites to link to from our own web site. However, even if the third party is affiliated with Cole Haan, Cole Haan has no control over these linked web sites which each have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of Cole Haan. Cole Haan has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. These linked web sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our web site and the links placed upon it and therefore we request feedback on not only our own web site, but for web sites we link to as well (including if a specific link does not work).
