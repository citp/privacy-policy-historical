## Privacy Policy

ColorOfChange.org was created to empower its members — defined as people who have signed up on the ColorOfChange.org Web site — to take actions on issues that concern them. To facilitate this mission, we collect personal information about our members, including your email address, address, and at times phone number. We will not under any circumstances share your information with any other group or organization without your explicit permission.

We will not make your street address publicly available, but we may transmit it to members of Congress, the President, or other targets specifically noted on the signup page. We will also use your first name to indicate the latest actions taken on our site, which you can view [here](http://www.colorofchange.org/blog/).

We will send you updates on this and other important campaigns by email. If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from our email list, you may do so.
