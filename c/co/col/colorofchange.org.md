## Introduction

This website, https://www.colorofchange.org, (the “Site”) is operated by ColorOfChange.org (“We” or “Us”).

ColorOfChange.org is a California nonprofit public benefit corporation exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code dedicated to strengthening the voice of Black Americans and pressuring targets in government and corporate America to take actions that create important real-world changes for Black folks and our allies.

Please note that any information and materials that you post or disclose through these services may be published on the Site and may become public information that is available to visitors to the Site and members of the general public.

## Other Information

### Other Information We Collect

“Other Information” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual, such as:

  * Browser information
  * Server log files
  * Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies
  * Demographic information and other information provided by you
  * Aggregated information



### How we collect Other Information

We and our third party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:

  * Through your browser: Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system version and Internet browser type and version.
  * Through server log files: An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Site.
  * Using cookies: Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for record keeping and other purposes. We and our service providers use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Site, as well as for online tracking purposes. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>. If you choose to decline cookies, some or all of the features and functionality of the Site may not be available to you.
  * Using embedded images, pixel tags and other similar technologies: We may use embedded images or pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) in connection with some Site pages and email messages to, among other things, track the actions of Site users and email recipients, measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates. URLs contained in emails contain an ID that enables us to identify Site users who take an action using a page from the Site, and we may use these URLs to simplify the process of signing petitions and completing surveys. We may occasionally present a shortened URL that references a longer URL that contains an ID. We do this to simplify the display, to prevent links from becoming broken when copied, and to ensure compatibility with email programs that do not handle long URLs. When a shortened URL is displayed in an email, you will see the full URL in the browser’s address bar when you access the page.
  * From you: We may collect demographic information such as your location, as well as other information, such as your preferred means of communication, when you voluntarily provide this information to us. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site.
  * By aggregating information: We may aggregate Personal Information so that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site.



### How we use and disclose Other Information

Because Other Information does not personally identify you, we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose. For example, we may analyze aggregated information from Site users and their actions for research related to improving our impact on issues affecting Black Americans. In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your zip code). If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.

## Security

We use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information under our control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us of the issue by contacting us in accordance with the “Contacting Us” section below.
