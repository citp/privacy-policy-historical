Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive.

**1) DATA COLLECTION ON COLOMBIA NETWORK**

**Colombia collects both PII & non-PII data.** We collect PII data through enquires or through Colombia registration page etc. We may collect name, email address, phone no. etc. We keep PII data in hashed form.

Colombia collects non-PIIs such as browser, device, device type, OS, IP, network provider, platform, geo-location (derived from IP), mobile advertising IDs such as Apple IDFA or Google AAID.

We collect events related to Colombia ad serving activity such as the number of ads or type of ads shown to a user or ads clicked by a user on different scenarios or post-click activity in relation to the ad. **This allows us to personalize and develop user analytics in a secure & non-identifying way for users.**

We also collect technical user identifiers from our advertising partners for the purpose of linking the different browsers and mobile apps you use and serve you relevant ads based on your behaviour across environments (“ID syncing”).

We collect information in order to improve the relevancy of ads being shown to you. The data we collect is used for reporting and analytics purposes and to give our clients & partners more information about the performance of their advertising campaigns and to improve performance over a long time.

**We don't use or store full IP address**  for targeting purposes. We do not collect hardware-based identifiers such as Mac Address.

We do not process any information which could be used by Colombia, directly or indirectly, to determine the personal identity of the user.

**Colombia doesn't knowingly show any interest based advertisement to & collect and maintain data from children less than 13 years of age.** If we realize we have unknowingly collected data from children less than 13 years of age, we make considerable efforts to remove such information from our system.

[**⇱  Apple Safari**](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21411?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US)[ ](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21411?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US)

You can opt-out from targeted advertising on this website and more generally across the internet using the opt-out tools of ad industry bodies, including:

[**⇱  European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)**](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)

**_  
WHAT DOES OPT-OUT MEAN_** ** __**

**• Not Opted Out:**  Colombia will serve you interest based sponsored content based on your history.

**• Opted Out:**  You have opted out of interest based advertising; Colombia will no longer serve you with personalized sponsored content recommendations based on your internet usage history.

Opting out will NOT prevent you from seeing our sponsored advertisements, but ads you see will likely be less relevant because they won’t be tailored to your interests.

You may still continue to see sponsored content relevant to the current website/webpage you are viewing (i.e. context-based ads).

Note that if your browsers are configured to reject cookies, your opt-out may not be effective, since we identify your choice to opt-out based on a cookie we deliver to you. So you will need to confirm that your browser is configured properly in order to make the opt-out option  effective.

**3) OPTING OUT OF DIFFERENT BROWSERS AND DEVICES**

By clicking on above opt-out button user won’t be shown interest-based advertising on current browser. If a user wants to opt-out from all the browsers, he or she has to exercise his or her choice in all the browsers and devices. In case we have matched a user in multiple browsers & devices, opting out on one browser he or she will be opted out from all the matched browsers & devices.

**a) Online web & mweb environment:**

To honour a user’s opt-out choice, Colombia drops an opt-out cookie. Colombia stores user profile for a maximum of 30 days between two subsequent visits i.e. if a user doesn’t revisit any CAN publisher at least once within 30 days, the user profile along with opt-out preferences is deleted and then he/she will have to again opt out from interest-based advertising. The lifespan of Colombia cookie is 10 years. If the user regularly visits any of CAN publishers(at least once in every 30 days) then the opt-out choices are stored for a maximum of 10 years with the cookie. In case a user deletes opt-out cookie from a browser then he/she will have to again opt out from the interest-based advertising.

**b) In-app environment:**

**Web browser environment and in-app environment are separate.**  If you don't want to receive interest-based sponsored content irrespective of the platform type, a user must disable or opt out from both the online web and mobile-app environment.

To opt out from interest-based advertising on an android app, the user should refer to “Ads” tab under google setting in his/her android device. Refer link for detailed steps for doing the same.  
[https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/3405269](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/3405269)

To opt out from interest-based advertising on an iOS app, the user has to use the “Limit Ad Tracking” option. Follow the instructions provided by Apple. Refer link [http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4228](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4228)

**PARTNER NETWORKS:**

Colombia has partnerships with multiple ad networks which render ads through Colombia's proprietary platform. If a user opts out of Colombia’s interest-based ads, this does not mean that he/she is will not receive interest based ads from Colombia’s network partners serving ads through Colombia’s platform on Colombia publisher network. 

If a user is interested in opting out from specific network's interest-based ads, he or she can opt out through the network’s privacy policy page or the opt out page.

If the user has opted out of any of our network partners, he/she will not obtain personalized ads from that partner via Colombia or as mentioned in their respective privacy terms. He/she may still receive personalized ads from Colombia and other partner networks serving through Colombia’s platform.

**INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES**

We may receive information about you from other sources, add it to our account information and treat it in accordance with this policy. If you provide information to the platform provider or other partners, whom we provide services, your account information and order information may be passed on to us. We may obtain updated contact information from third parties in order to correct our records and fulfil the services or to communicate with you.

  


**DEMOGRAPHIC AND PURCHASE INFORMATION**

We may refer other sources of demographic and other information in order to provide you with more targeted communications and promotions. We use Google Analytics, among others, to track the user behaviour on our website. Google Analytics specifically has been enabled to support display advertising towards helping us gain the understanding of our users' demographics and interests. The reports are anonymous and cannot be associated with any individual’s personally identifiable information that you may have shared with us. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can install the Google Analytics browser add-on.

  


**LINK TO THIRD PARTY SITES**

TIL includes links to other websites. Such sites are governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond our control. Once you leave our servers (you can tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information.

When we present information to our advertisers -- to help them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our website -- it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to the various pages within our site. When you register with TIL, we contact you from time to time about updation of your content to provide the users such features that we believe may benefit you.

**INFORMATION SHARING**

TIL shares the sensitive personal information to any third-party without obtaining the prior consent of the user in the following limited circumstances:

a) When it is requested or required by law or by any court or governmental agency or authority to disclose, for the purpose of verification of identity, or for the prevention, detection, investigation including cyber incidents, or for prosecution and punishment of offences. These disclosures are made in good faith and belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for enforcing these terms and for complying with the applicable laws and regulations.

b) TIL proposes to share such information within its group companies and officers and employees of such group companies for the purpose of processing personal information on its behalf. We also ensure that these recipients of such information agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy, any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

**ACCESSING AND UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
When you use TIL's websites, we make good  efforts to provide you, , with access to your personal information as and when requested. We shall further ensure that any personal information or sensitive personal data or information found to be inaccurate or deficient shall be corrected or amended as feasible, subject to any requirement for such personal information or sensitive personal data or information to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case, where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.

**INFORMATION SECURITY**  
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to the data or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of the same. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage, processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

All information gathered on TIL is securely stored within the TIL controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access.

However, the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our privacy policy from time to time to incorporate necessary future changes. Of course, our use of any information we gather will always be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may interest you. Any complaints or request or concerns with regards to the content or to report any abuse of laws or breach of these terms may be taken up with the designated grievance officer as mentioned below via post or by sending an email to [colombia@timesinternet.in ](mailto:colombia@timesinternet.in)to Mr. Kapil Kapoor("Grievance Officer").
