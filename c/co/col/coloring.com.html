    <h2 align="center">Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</h2>
    
    This is the web site of <b>Coloring.com</b>.
    <br>
    We can be reached via e-mail at <a href="mailto:hello5@coloring.com">hello5@coloring.com</a>
    <p>
    The operation of Coloring.com is very straightforward and simple.  When you first visit the site, the web server
    automatically assigns you a unique cookie, so that in the log files we can try to distinguish one user from
    another.  The log file also records your IP address, so that at the end of the day we can determine roughly 
    where my visitors are coming from.  Note I say "your" IP address.  I don't mean you personally, just you as a 
    visitor.  With just the unique cookie and your current IP address, we can't determine who you are.  But it does 
    provide us with aggregate information that we use to promote and describe the site to advertisers.
    </p><p>
    As you continue through the site, you may opt to "email a picture" to someone.  To be able to relay your message,
    naturally we have to ask for the names (not necessarily real names) and emails of the sender and receipient.  This is recorded in the database so the picture can be saved and retrieved later.  <b>This email information 
    will not be shared with other organizations or businesses for commercial purposes.</b>  In fact, it will 
    probably be destroyed after long period of time.  Until then, we will use this email information once for 
    marketing purposes, as a followup to inform the user of changes to the site and welcoming them to use 
    other site features, such as signing up for a newsletter.  
    </p><p>
    To reiterate, your email address (the only personally identifiable information possibly submitted so far) will
    only be used to fulfill your request (sending the message) and communicate back with you once to further market
    the site.
    </p><p>
    If you wish, you can send an email to us asking to place your email address on the "deny" list.  This will
    prevent the email address from ever receiving a marketing message from Coloring.com.
    </p><p>
    Shortly, new functionality will be added for enhanced features.  A visitor can register with the site by 
    choosing a unique screen name, and providing their email address.  The email address will never be published
    on the site, and will only be used for administrative reasons (forgotten password, notification of winning
    a contest, etc).  If the visitor indicates that they are under age 13, then the parent's email address will
    be solicited as well so that they can be notified that their child has registered and given the chance to
    intervene.
    </p><p>
    Another new site feature will be the ability to sign up for newsletters.  A visitor will have to have an
    account to sign up for a newsletter, and new or existing accounts will have to "opt in" meaning they will
    have to explicitly choose to begin receiving the newsletter.  These newsletters are separate from the 
    aforementioned followup marketing email.
    </p><p>
    With this basic registration information we can improve and customize the look and behavior of the site to your liking.  To accomplish this, we will use cookies to store simple preference information, such as the size of the
    pictures you wish to color or what color scheme you prefer for the pages.  At no time will any cookies contain
    sensitive information, personal or otherwise, that would be a considered a security risk.
    </p><p>
    With respect to advertisements,  to try and bring you offers that are of interest to you, we have relationships 
    with other companies that we allow to place ads on our Web pages. As a result of your visit to our site, ad 
    server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information.  
    For further information, consult the privacy policies of <a href="http://www.valueclickmedia.com/privacy.shtml">ValueClick Media</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html">Google</a>.
    </p><p>
    From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in 
    our privacy notice.  If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy 
    changes to our web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these 
    new uses.  If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our web site periodically.
    </p><p>
    If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, or you have outstanding questions that you would like answered, you may contact us via the above email address.
