# Privacy Policy

Your privacy and the security of your information and identification are two things that we take very seriously. We understand the importance of protecting your confidential information and financial records. Our philosophy and corporate culture is, and has always been, to protect your confidential information. We are providing you our privacy policy, as required by law, to explain our information practices.

We want you to understand what information we collect and how we use it, which is summarized in this privacy policy. It reflects the corporate culture of our bank other than as required or permitted by law. It is our commitment not to share confidential customer information with non-affiliated companies, other than as permitted by law.

Columbia State Bank maintains procedures that are designed to protect confidential information about you, and the products and services you receive from us. To provide you with a broad range of financial products and services as effectively and conveniently as possible, we use technology to manage and maintain customer information.

  
We will NOT sell personally identifying information to a non-affiliated company for the purpose of solicitation. Nor will we provide confidential information to a non-affiliated company for its own use.
