<ol type="a">
<li>there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control;</li>

We ask you not to share your password with anyone and keep your account information secure. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Site like message boards.</p>
<p>In the event that Personal Information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, College Recruiter will notify those persons whose Personal Information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
<h3>5. PUBLIC FORUMS  </h3>
<p>You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose any Personal Information in a public forum on the Site, this information, along with any information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from third parties.

You accept that you, and not College Recruiter, are responsible for providing such information in any public forum. Any submissions to public areas on the Site are accepted by you with the understanding that such forums are accessible to all third parties. If you do not want your comments or any content to be viewed by third parties, you are advised not to make any submissions. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and/or account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.</p>
