		<p>Following are examples of the types of accounts and services offered on this website and the type of information that is collected from the user. By providing any such information, the user consents to our Privacy Policy. </p>		
		
		
		<h4 class="dtm">For Students or For Parents sections</h4>
		
		<p>We may collect personally identifiable information directly from users who are interested in obtaining services, products, or using tools within the <b>For Students</b> or <b>For Parents</b> sections of the site.  Users do not need an online account to view most of the website, however, to perform certain tasks or to save personalized information, accounts are required.  Some examples of these tasks include: registering for an exam, saving college or scholarship searches, and viewing exam results.  </p>

		<p><b>Account creation: </b>We collect the following personally identifiable information from users who wish to create an online account: first name, middle initial, last name, zip code, gender, date of birth, date of high school graduation, email address, username, and password.  In addition, users can supply a parent or guardian's first and last name, and email address.</p>

		<p><b>CC a Parent feature:</b> Our <a href="/parent_student_link/psl-parent-cc-popup.html">CC a Parent</a> service allows a parent or guardian to receive copies of the important emails that we send students. We require the parent or guardian's first and last name, as well as an email address. The parent or guardian must accept the email confirmation sent by the College Board in order to receive copies of any emails. This service currently includes the following automatic emails: </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Reminders about upcoming dates and deadlines</li>
			<li>SAT<sup>®</sup> registration receipts and notifications</li>
			<li>SAT Admission Tickets for test day </li>
			<li>Test center alerts </li>

		<p><b>Test registration: </b>We typically collect the following information from students registering for an exam: postal address, telephone number, date of birth, social security number (optional), and email address.

		<ul>
			<li><b>Applying for a federal loan:</b> The user is directed to a third-party website. Although these pages are co-branded with the College Board logo, an outside service provider is actually collecting and using the personally identifying information to process each application. Therefore, the third-party loan provider's privacy policy governs the collection and use of the information that users provide. </li>
			<li><b>Applying for a private loan:</b> We maintain relationships with outside service providers for some of the services offered through our site. Although, the information offered by these outside providers may be presented in a framed format with the College Board border, the service provider is prominently identified. Please be aware that any information supplied on those framed pages is sent directly to the service providers, and is subject to their security and privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these outside service providers because their privacy practices may differ from ours.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><b>Online store: </b> When you purchase products or services from us, we capture credit card information, the type of services or products ordered or purchased, and the date of the order or purchase.</p>

		<p><b>Tell a Friend/Email a Friend:</b> When you use our Tell/Email a Friend service, sharing College Search information or referring an article, we collect your name and email address, as well as your friend's name and email address to perform this service. We send a one-time email containing the requested information to your friend.  We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.  </p>

		<p>We may collect personally identifiable information directly from users who are interested in obtaining services, products, or using tools, within the <b>For Educators</b> section of the site. Users do not need an online account to view most of the website, however, to perform certain tasks or save personalized information, accounts are required.  Some examples of these tasks include: ordering AP<sup>®</sup> materials or PSAT/NMSQT<sup>®</sup> exam materials, registering for workshops, and requesting additional fee waivers. The information may be provided through one or several of the services discussed below.</p>
