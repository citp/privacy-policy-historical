Additionally, Visto may partner with other advertising networks and providers to deliver ads on our behalf, or on behalf of others, across the Internet. These third party companies collect information about your visits to our website, and non-affiliated websites and mobile apps over time and across associated browsers and devices in order to provide you with more relevant advertising on other websites and mobile apps. This type of advertising in known as interest-based advertising.

Exercising choice through these tools will stop the collection of data from the browser or device where choice was made for interest-based advertising on that browser or device and associated devices, and the use of information collected from associated devices for interest-based advertising on the opted-out browser or device. Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or mobile device. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.
