# Privacy policy :: Colonial First State

## Colonial First State Privacy Policy 

Australia's National Privacy Policy defines Personal Information as information or opinion that allows others to identify you. It includes your name, age, gender, contact details, as well as your health and financial information. 

At Colonial First State the privacy of your personal information is important to us. We collect personal information to provide you with the products and services you request as well as information about compatible or related products and services we offer. In some circumstances the law may also require us to collect personal information. 

## How is my personal information dealt with?

The privacy of your personal information is important to us. 

We form part of the Commonwealth Bank Group of companies (“Group”), a well known financial services organisation. The Group offers a broad range of products and services.

We collect personal information so that you can be provided with the products and services you request.   We may also share personal information with other Group companies so that you and the Group can have access to an integrated view of the relationship. The Group may also tell you about other products and services that might suit your financial, lifestyle or electronic needs.  The law may also require us to collect personal information.

We may disclose personal information to other parties (confidentiality arrangements apply) for certain purposes that we outsource, including bulk mailing, market research and information technology support.  We also seek expert help from time to time to help us improve our systems, products and services. Your personal information may be disclosed to these third parties in such circumstances.  Your personal information will not be shared with other third parties (except with our related bodies for prudential and risk management purposes or as otherwise set out in this statement).

Your personal information may also be used by us to administer, monitor and evaluate products and services, gather, aggregate and report statistical information, assist you with any queries and take measures to detect and prevent fraud and other illegal activity.  We may also be allowed or obliged to disclose or receive information by law and to report on prudential or risk management matters.

If you notify us that you have a personal financial adviser, then details of your investment will be provided to them. If you hold our products and services through a Commonwealth Financial Planner, who is part of the Group, personal information may be used by other Group companies for marketing purposes.

We aim to ensure that the personal information we retain about you is accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you provide us with incomplete or inaccurate information, you may not be able to be provided with the products or services you are seeking.

If you have concerns about the completeness or accuracy of the information we have about you or would like to access or amend your information, simply call us on 13 13 36 or send an email to [contactus@colonialfirststate.com.au](mailto:contactus@colonialfirststate.com.au). You can contact us if you do not want to receive any marketing information from us or any other Group company. You may be contacted by telephone unless you ask us not to do so. To stop receiving telemarketing please call 13 13 36.
