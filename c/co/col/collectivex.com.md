# CollectiveX

## 1\. Professional Plans (No Ads)

CollectiveX is a group communication and networking platform. This section describes the types of personal and/or group information we may collect and how we use it to provide the CollectiveX.com (“CollectiveX”) service for Professional Plans. Please note, there is a separate privacy policy for Lite (Ad Supported) Plans (see section 2).

By using CollectiveX, you agree to the collection and use of your personal and/or group information as described in this policy. You should know:

  * We collect limited account information and store and maintain your account and profile information on our secure servers.
  * We will never rent, sell or share information that personally identifies you for marketing purposes without your express permission.
  * You can update your account information and preferences at any time



To comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, at this time CollectiveX is only available to users who are at least 13 years old. If you are under 13, please do not use the CollectiveX service.

## What types of personal information do we collect and how do we use it?

_Account information._ When you register with CollectiveX, we will request some personal information, including your first and last name, email address, and password to create your account. Your password will be maintained on our system in an encrypted form.

_Group data and contents and usage._ The contents of your CollectiveX account are stored and maintained on CollectiveX servers in order to provide the service. Because we keep back-up copies of data for the purposes of recovery from errors or system failure, residual copies of group contents may remain on our systems for some time, even after you have deleted information or after the termination of your account. CollectiveX employees do not access the content of any accounts unless you specifically request them to do so (for example, if you are having technical difficulties accessing your account) or if required by law, to maintain our system, or to protect CollectiveX or the public.

We also may collect information about the use of your account, such as how much bandwidth you are using, how often you log in and other information related to your use of CollectiveX. Information displayed or clicked on in your CollectiveX account (including user interface elements, links, and other information) is also recorded. We use this information internally to deliver the best possible service to you, such as improving the CollectiveX user experience.

CollectiveX will never sell, rent or share your personal information with any third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission.

## Group data storage

Although CollectiveX owns the data storage, databases and all rights to the CollectiveX application, you retain all rights to your data and we will never sell or share your data with any third-parties, contact your group members directly, or use your data for our own business advantage.

CollectiveX reserves the right to distribute periodic updates regarding the CollectiveX service to all group managers. We respect the privacy of our account holders, and the privacy of their member data.

## Transfer of information

We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of CollectiveX, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, CollectiveX will notify you before information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Updating your information

You can change your CollectiveX account settings at any time in the "Manager" section of your account. You can terminate your account at any time, by going to the account/billing sub-tab within the “Manager” section of your account.
