  account. Your password will be maintained on our system in an encrypted form.</p>
<p><em>Group data and contents and usage.</em> The contents of your CollectiveX account are stored 
  and maintained on CollectiveX servers in order to provide the service. Because we keep back-up 
  copies of data for the purposes of recovery from errors or system failure, residual copies of 
  group contents may remain on our systems for some time, even after you have deleted information 
  or after the termination of your account. CollectiveX employees do not access the content of any 
  accounts unless you specifically request them to do so (for example, if you are having technical 
  difficulties accessing your account) or if required by law, to maintain our system, or to protect 
  CollectiveX or the public.</p>

  using, how often you log in and other information related to your use of CollectiveX. Information 
  displayed or clicked on in your CollectiveX account (including user interface elements, links, 
  and other information) is also recorded. We use this information internally to deliver the best 
  possible service to you, such as improving the CollectiveX user experience.</p>
