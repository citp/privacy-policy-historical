<h2> What types of personal information do we collect and how do we use it? </h2>
<p>
    <i>Account information.</i> When you register with Groupsite.com, we will request some personal information, including your first and last name, email address, and password to create your account. Your password will be maintained on our system in an encrypted form.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Email.</i> Groupsite.com will send to the primary email address specified in your Groupsite.com profile a monthly Groupsites-related newsletter. You may unsubscribe from this newsletter by writing to <span class="emailCloak mail-link">news(at)groupsite.com</span> with UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line or using the opt-out URL provided in every newsletter.
</p>
<p>
    Groupsite Managers of Groupsite Pro accounts may also notify Groupsite.com if they wish their Groupsite members' addresses to be collectively suppressed from our newsletter distribution. Such requests can be made in writing to: news@groupsite.com and will not apply to Groupsite members that are also members of any other Groupsite.
</p>
<p>
    Groupsite.com may occasionally contact pending Groupsite members with invitations to join your group by e-mail. Pending members are individuals who have not responded (with either a negative or affirmative response) to membership invitations extended by Groupsite managers and/or members. Invitations extended by Groupsite.com to pending members will clearly identify Groupsite.com, the name of the relevant Groupsite, the name of the person who invited them and an email opt-out option.
</p>
<p>
    Groupsite.com may also distribute periodic updates regarding the Groupsite.com service to group managers. These administrative messages are considered part of your Groupsite.com account service and group managers may not opt-out of receiving them.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Group data and contents and usage.</i> The contents of your Groupsite.com account are stored and maintained on Groupsite.com servers in order to provide the service. Because we keep back-up copies of data for the purposes of recovery from errors or system failure, residual copies of group contents may remain on our systems for some time, even after you have deleted information or after the termination of your account. Groupsite.com employees do not access the content of any accounts unless you specifically request them to do so (for example, if you are having technical difficulties accessing your account) or if required by law, to maintain our system, or to protect Groupsite.com or the public.
</p>
<p>
    We also may collect information about the use of your account, such as how much bandwidth you are using, how often you log in and other information related to your use of Groupsite.com. Information displayed or clicked on in your Groupsite.com account (including user interface elements, links, and other information) is also recorded. We use this information internally to deliver the best possible service to you, such as improving the Groupsite.com user experience.
