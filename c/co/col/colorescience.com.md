### Web Beacons

Our Services contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

We may use a third party to gather information about how you and others use our Services. For example, we will know how many users access a specific page and which links they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our Services are used.

We may partner with third party ad network(s) to either display advertising on our Services or to manage our advertising on other websites. Our ad network partner(s) may use cookies and/or web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on our Services and other websites to provide you with targeted advertising based upon your interests. Our system may not respond to Do Not Track requests or headers from some or all browsers.

We may also use services hosted by third parties, such as Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), to assist in providing the Services. Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use the Services. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Services (including your IP address) will be transmitted to, and stored by, Google on their servers. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Services, compiling reports on website activity for us and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf.

### Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We will not store your complete credit card information on our servers, but will only use an incomplete identifier (e.g., last four digits of your credit card number) to identify your Account. Any complete credit card information you choose to store in connection with your Account will be stored by our third party payment processing service providers such as Authorize.net.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Services, you can contact us at the address listed at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.
