<h1 class="main-title">Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="content-frame">
<p>This privacy policy applies to the Web site only and does not cover information collected on any third-party sites to which this Web site links. This privacy policy is part of, and must be read in conjunction with, the Web site's Terms and Conditions. You can read the entire Terms and Conditions by either scrolling up to the top of this Web page or by clicking here. If you do not agree with the Terms and Conditions in their entirety, please do not use this Web site.</p>
<h2>Web Site Users</h2>
<p>College Prowler generally collects personally identifiable information such as a name, postal address, E-mail address, telephone number, or credit card information with your specific knowledge and consent.</p>
<p><strong>How does the Web site use information supplied by me?</strong>Occasionally, visitors to our Web site may be asked to supply certain personally identifying information, which is then retained by College Prowler. For example, we ask you for certain information if you choose to subscribe to our E-mail newsletters, our online discussion forums, or our premium online content. If you choose to give us personally identifying information at such time, such information will be retained by us and used only to provide you with products or services you have requested, or with additional information from College Prowler about College Prowler, its affiliates, or selected outside companies whose products or services we feel may be of use to you. Any information from selected outside companies will be transmitted by College Prowler so that such companies will not have access either to your E-mail address or to your other personally identifying information. Moreover, we will not sell or rent any personally identifying information obtained through the Web site to any other company or organization. However, if you choose to participate in the College Prowler Scholarship, any and all information that is submitted by the entrant may be used and sold by third party relationships for direct marketing purposes. </p>
<p>If, at some point after giving College Prowler your personally identifying information, you do not wish to continue to receive additional information from College Prowler about College Prowler, its affiliates, or selected outside companies, in general, you may opt out by E-mailing webmaster@collegeprowler.com and put the words "remove my name" in the subject line of your E-mail; in the case of our E-mail newsletters, you also may follow the procedures at our E-mail newsletter registration page. </p>
<p>From time to time, the personally identifying information that you provide to us may be shared with our suppliers or service providers who assist us in maintaining and managing our newsletters, our archives, our premium online content, our online discussion forums, and other activities on the Web site. Such suppliers or service providers may use your personally identifying information only in the course of providing services to College Prowler, but they may not use such information for other purposes.</p>
<p>While your individual information is protected as discussed above, College Prowler reserves the right to use such individual information to create aggregated, anonymous data about users in order to develop statistics about activity on and visitors to the Web site. In addition, College Prowler may disclose personal information if we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Web site; or (4) protect the personal safety, property, or rights of our users or the public.</p>
<p><strong>What are "cookies" and how do you use them?</strong> "Cookies" are pieces of information that are placed by a Web site in a storage place on your computer. Cookies do not contain information that is, in itself, personally identifying. Cookies are placed on your computer in a limited way to help deliver advertisements, to calculate unique site visitors, and to track usage throughout our site. Other uses include placement of cookies to make the login process more convenient for users of our E-mail newsletters, our archives, our premium online content, and our online discussion forums. In addition, some advertisers may place cookies on your computer. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.</p>
<p>In addition, we contract with certain third parties to help manage and optimize our Web site business, including the following:</p>
<p>We use the services of a third party marketing company, Elliance, to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use the Web site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by this third party marketing company at this Web site. This information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. You can "opt-out" of our ability to analyze such Elliance data by emailing, webmaster@collegeprowler.com. </p>
<p><strong>How is my credit card information used when I make a purchase?</strong> When you make a purchase, we ask you to provide your credit card information so that we can process your payment. During the ordering process, such credit card information is transmitted to College Prowler (in the case of our premium online content) or (in the case of our archives, subscriptions, and mail order products) to one of our suppliers or service providers. In both cases, credit card information is then transmitted to third-party credit card processors and card issuers that must use your information to process your order.</p>
<h2>College Prowler Customers</h2>
<p>From time to time, College Prowler is approached by third parties interested in contacting our readers, people who have purchased a book through our site or a premium online service. Perhaps they are in a similar business or have a product to offer that would interest our subscribers. We may provide our mailing list of readers to such third parties if we believe our readers would be interested in hearing from them. Many of our readers find this a valuable and timesaving service. If you have bought a guide from us and want us to exclude your name from mailing lists provided to third parties, mail a letter to the address below, or E-mail us at the address below with your request. Please specify that you would like your name removed from the mailing list, and include your full name and address or the address label from your magazine. Mail your request to: College Prowler, Mailing List, Pittsburgh, PA. 15213 or send an E-mail to webmaster@collegeprowler.com. Please allow six to eight weeks for your request to take effect.</p>
<h2>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
<p>No one under the age of 13 should provide any personal information. In general, College Prowler does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If in limited circumstances we do knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, we will do so only with verified parental consent prior to collection. In the event that we learn that we have collected information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete this information from our database as quickly as possible. If you believe the Web site has any information about anyone under 13, please contact us at webmaster@collegeprowler.com. </p>
