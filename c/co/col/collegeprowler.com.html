        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on September 18, 2013 and applies to the Niche.com, Inc.

Continued access to the Niche Services by you will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the Privacy Policy, please do not use the Niche Services. This policy does not cover information collected on any third-party site to which the Niche Services link.&nbsp;Your use of the Niche Services is subject to our Terms of Use which can be read <a href="http://niche.com/legal/terms/">here</a>. If you access the Niche Services through Facebook, you may be required to read and accept the Facebook terms of service and privacy policy.</p>
<h2>How does Niche use information supplied by me?</h2>
<p><strong>Information collected from users of premium content:</strong> If you choose to subscribe to certain Niche Services you may be asked to supply certain personally identifying information such as name, postal address, email address or telephone number. This information is retained by Niche in order to provide you with the products or services you have requested, including additional information from Niche about Niche, its affiliates, or selected outside companies whose products or services we feel may be of use to you. Any information from selected outside companies will be transmitted by Niche so that such companies will not have access either to your E-mail address or to your other personally identifying information.</p>
<p><strong>Information collected from Niche scholarship applicants: </strong>When submitting an application for the scholarship contest, applicants may opt-in to receive student related offers from Niche and our trusted business partners. The choice is entirely optional and has no impact on the applicant's submission to the scholarship contest. If a scholarship applicant indicates an interest in receiving offers from Niche and its trusted business partners, Niche reserves the right to use your personal information and may sell or share it with selected outside companies. If you express interest in particular schools or affiliates, Niche may sell or transfer your personal information to those schools or affiliates accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Information collected from Niche account registrants:</strong> Information collected in the registration process may include, among other things, name, address, e-mail address, phone number, age, citizenship, details of academic and work history, preferences about the student's future, and other information entered into the user account. All information entered is voluntary and it is solely up to the user whether he or she furnishes such information. If a user does provide such information, he or she is consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you express interest in particular schools or affiliates, Niche may sell or transfer your personal information to those schools or affiliates accordingly. Visitors to the Niche Services will not be able to view the personal contact information of any Niche Services users. Personal contact information includes a user’s full name, email address, mailing address, and phone number. Only the account user is able to edit and update the information provided in his or her account. We may, on occasion, email our users to send notifications related to features on the site. It is our intention to give access to your account only to the authorized Representatives you designate but we cannot guarantee that others will not, without our consent, access this data. You may opt out of any future usage of your Niche account from our database at any time; however, a Representative may have saved a copy of your account before it was deleted. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of accounts in this situation.</p>
<p><strong>Information collected from users of Niche Apps:</strong>&nbsp;When you use and install a Niche application on Facebook, you allow Niche to access certain information from your Facebook profile to establish your profile within the application. The information you allow the Niche application to access is affected by the privacy settings you establish at Facebook. As allowed by you based upon your Facebook settings, the Niche application will access and store for caching purposes only the following information from your Facebook profile:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>Your current city and hometown</li>
<li>Your work history and education</li>
<li>Your current profile picture</li>
<li>Your email address</li>
<li>Your connections and their work history, education and profile picture</li>
</ul>
<p>You can control how much of your Facebook profile information is shared with other Niche application users using the Settings function with the application. Regardless of these settings your Niche application profile information will be automatically shared with your Facebook friends and their friends within the application. We will prompt you before posting any Niche application activity onto Facebook.</p>
<p>Users who wish to deactivate their profiles may do so at any time using the Settings function.</p>
