### WINSTON BRANDS PRIVACY POLICY

Winston Brands has developed this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) which details important information regarding the use and disclosure of user information collected on Winston Brands owned or controlled websites, mobile sites, and related services, communications and tools that link to this Privacy Policy, and when you interact offline with Winston Brands regarding those sites, and related services and tools (collectively referred to as the "Services"). Winston Brands provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use to use the Services and the choices we offer for you to manage the information we collect. Each time that you access or use the Services, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy or Terms of Service (“Terms”), which are incorporated into this Privacy Policy by reference and govern your use of our Services, please discontinue accessing or using the Services. 

### 1\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

_**Information Collected Directly From You.**_ You can browse our Services without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information. If you create an account, contact us or purchase any of our Services, you are choosing to give us your personal information, including but not limited to your name, address, email address, phone number, mobile telephone number, or physical contact information about yourself. You may also provide payment information such as credit or debit card information and billing address to purchase our products and services. 

_**Information Imported from Social Networks.**_ We will collect information from you when you interact with our Services through third party social networking services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google +) (each and collectively, a "Social Network"). You may also have the option to consent to connecting your activity on our Services with your Social Network information and activity. If you choose to use our Social Network populating feature to create an account, we may import information for your account or profile on our Services from a Social Network. We only import from the information you allow to be imported from the Social Network which is controlled by your privacy settings on that Social Network (“Permitted Social Network Content”). The authentication of your Social Network login credentials is conducted solely by the Social Network. If you permit a connection, we and that Social Network may be able to identify you and associate information received pursuant to the connection with information we already have about you. Please review the Social Network’s privacy policy and choices for sharing information of any Social Network connected to our Services. By associating your Social Network account with our Services and authorizing us to have access to this information, you agree that we may collect, use, and store Permitted Social Network Content in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

_**Surveys and Promotions.**_ From time-to-time we may request information from you and other users via surveys, or contests, sweepstakes or other promotions. Participation is completely voluntary. Information collected may be used as set forth in this Privacy Policy and as set forth in the applicable terms or official rules, such as to notify the winners and award prizes, and file winners’ information as required by law. Survey information will be used for the purposes of the survey. 

_**Information You Post/Social Networks.**_ The Services are designed to enable you to communicate with others and any information or content you post when participating with the Services and Social Networks, plug ins or other applications becomes public information, depending upon your privacy settings, and is subject to redistribution by Winston Brands and third parties. There is no expectation of privacy when posting content or otherwise participating in such interactive forums and we have no control over how those users may use the information you make public. Therefore, you should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting. 

_**Mobile Devices.**_ We may collect additional information from you if you access our Services through a mobile device; for example, your unique device identifier, device’s operating system, mobile carrier, and regional location. We may also collect your location information from your IP address or zip code. The degree to which your location can be identified depends on the device you are using, e.g. laptop, smartphone, tablet or other access device (each a “Device”) and how you are connected to the internet (e.g. via cable broadband connection, WiFi, etc.). 

_**Information about Others/Inviting Friends.**_ From time to time you may choose to submit personal information about other people to invite them to join a Service. Inviting friends is always optional. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the Services, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend. 

_**Information We Collect From Third Parties.**_ We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information we collect, such as information to validate or update your address or demographic and lifestyle information. 

### 2\. INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

_**Tracking Technologies.**_ In addition to any information that you choose to submit to us, we and our business partners may use a variety of tracking technologies ("Tracking Technologies"), that automatically (or passively) collect certain information from your Device whenever you visit or interact with the Services or third party sites. This information may include your Device identifier, the type and version of Internet browser software you use, and your operating system. We may also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and connection information. During some visits, we may use these tools to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages and page interaction information. Certain features of our Services are only available through the use of Tracking Technologies. You may encounter tracking technologies/cookies from our third party service providers that we have allowed on our Services and who assist us with various aspects of our operations and Services. We use Google to serve first party cookies (such as Google Analytics cookie) to report how our ad impressions, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the Services. To learn about Google Analytics’ current available opt-outs for the web, [click here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). To learn more about how Google uses cookies in interest based advertising, you can visit the Google ad and content network privacy policy [located here](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). You can opt-out of receiving interest based Google ads, or customize the ads Google shows you by [clicking here](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en). You can opt-out and find out more information about other third party analytics providers and their practices and your choices for data collection by clicking here. Please be aware that if you choose to block certain cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use those cookie dependent features, and preferences that are dependent on cookies may be lost. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated. Tracking Technologies are used for a variety of purposes, including the following: 

  * _**Operationally Necessary.**_ We may use Tracking Technologies for system administration, to prevent fraudulent activity, to improve security or to allow you to make use of our Services.
  * _**Performance Related.**_ We may use Tracking Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to improve content offered through the Services.
  * _**Functionality Related.**_ We may use Tracking Technologies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Services before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify the features in which you may have the greatest interest.
  * _**Targeting Related.**_ We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on the Services and third party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content, as well as to track the content you access. For more information, see Section 3 below.



_**Location Functionality.**_ Information gathered from your use of the Services may be combined with information from third-party sources to identify your location by state and region (“Regional Location”). If you enable location services for our Services, we may collect Regional Location data periodically as you use or leave open our Services. 

### 3\. TARGETED ADVERTISING

_**Interest Based Advertising.**_ We may use Tracking Technologies to collect information about your visits over time and across the Services and other third party web sites, as well as information received from other sources, in order to serve more targeted advertising to you. To serve our ads, we use a variety of third party advertising service providers, including networks, data exchanges, ad servers, analytics providers and others. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies to send directly to your Device the advertisements and links that appear on the Services. They automatically receive your Device identifier when this happens. Their tools may also limit the number of times you see the same ad and help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. These third parties may also use information gathered from your use of the Services to serve targeted, interest based advertisements to you on third party websites and applications. Some of the advertising service providers may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt-out of ad targeting from member companies. If you opt-out of receiving targeted ads in this manner, you will continue to receive advertising messages, but they will not be customized to you based on your use of the Services and third party sites. If you would like more information about advertisers’ use of tracking technologies and about your option not to accept them, you can go to [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). To learn more about how interest-based information is collected, whether the companies we use are part of an industry network regarding behavioral advertising, or to know your choices about not having information used in this manner, you can go to [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/). Some newer mobile device operating systems allow you to limit the use of information to deliver interest-based advertising in mobile applications. You can check the settings on your mobile Device for such options in your mobile Devices’ operating system. Alternatively, you may wish to download the TrustE mobile application and/or the Digital Alliance “App Choices” mobile application and follow the instructions provided. 

Please note that the opt-out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer or mobile application, and browser or operating system, on which the opt-out is applied. You can also accept or decline cookies through your browser settings. To learn more, please look at the cookie settings available in your specific web browser(s). 

_**Browser “Do Not Track” Signals.**_ Some third party browsers provide “do not track” machine readable signals for websites, which are automatically applied by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitors’ choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result, we do not respond to these signals.

### TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

_**Cookies.**_ A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Services. We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Services. Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives. We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Services and expire when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Services easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next. 

_**HTML5.**_ We use HTML5 in some of our applications, including in our mobile website for the iPhone or iPad. HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser “cookies” file and can be used to track users across websites. To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile Device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage. 

_**Web Beacons/GIFS.**_ Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Services, to monitor how users navigate the Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. 

_**Embedded Scripts.**_ An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device used to access Services from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. 

_**e-tags/cache browsers/web logs.**_ Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and Device identification in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Services. We may track your movement within the Services, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types. This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our Services, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or Device identification from the mobile Device that you used to access our Services and usage and browsing habits. We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our Services, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications. 

_**Device Fingerprinting.**_ We may use Device fingerprinting in some of our Services, which allows us to collect information about a remote computing Device for the purpose of identification. It can be used to prevent fraud or collect information about you.
