In the handling of your information, we follow a policy of "informed consent", that is to say: In using the varied features of this web site, you may occasionally provide information, such as your name, your contact information, or other information about yourself by which others may identify you (hereinafter "Personal Information"), to CIPC, the network of independent member firms known as Colliers International Property Consultants ("Colliers International"), its member companies, our service providers, or other businesses which you may contact while visiting our site.

However, we will never intentionally provide any of your Personal Information to other companies or individuals not listed above (collectively "Third Parties") without your express permission to do so. We will notify you at the time of such data collection or transfer if your Personal Information is to be shared with a Third Party and you will always have the option of not permitting such sharing.

The following describes how we are using the information that you provide to us.

**1\. What Personal Information does Colliers.com collect from you?**  
Colliers.com collects information in several ways from different parts of our web site.  
Some Personal Information is gathered when you sign up for our newsletter, enter a site feedback form, or complete a client satisfaction survey. During the on-line registration process, for example, Colliers.com may ask for your name, email address, telephone number, postal code, occupation, industry information and professional interests. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to assist you with your real estate needs.

**2\. What are cookies and how does Colliers.com use them?**  
As part of offering customized and personalized on-line services, Colliers.com uses cookies to store information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies allow Colliers.com to provide you with a more personalized experience when you visit our sites, to customize the information that you receive as part of the monthly newsletter and to be able to contact you when we have properties or information that you have requested.

Cookies from Colliers.com can only be read by Colliers.com. And, if you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you will still be able to access most of the areas on this site. However, please note that if you disable all cookies using your browser, you may not be able to edit your newsletter profile. So, if you wish to edit your newsletter profile, make sure that you have not configured your browser so as to disable all cookies.

**3\. How does Colliers.com use Personal Information?**  
Colliers.com's primary goal in collecting Personal Information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of sites. This includes personalized services, interactive communications, online transactions and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide such services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, Colliers.com is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you. Colliers.com does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this in order to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. CIPC may share aggregated user data with advertisers or business partners. However, CIPC will never intentionally provide any of your Personal Information to other companies or individuals without your permission to do so and will take all reasonable steps to protect such Personal Information from perpetrators of fraud or internet piracy.

**4\. Who is collecting information?**  
When you are on a Colliers.com site and are asked for Personal Information, you are sharing that information with Colliers.com alone unless it is specifically stated otherwise.

**5\. Does Colliers.com share my information with outsiders?**  
From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from Third Parties. If you opt-in to receive information from these Third Parties, Colliers.com will (with your permission) share your name and email address with them.  
HOWEVER, PLEASE NOTE THAT AS PART OF ITS PRIVACY POLICY CIPC RESERVES THE RIGHT TO TAKE ANY ACTION WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WHICH WE, IN OUR SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, DEEM NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE IF SUCH INFORMATION MAY CREATE A LIABILITY FOR US OR MAY CAUSE US TO LOSE ALL OR PART OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO US BY OUR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS OR OTHER SUPPLIERS.

**6\. What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?**  
Colliers.com may, from time to time, send you e-mail regarding our services. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from Colliers.com, we may occasionally send you direct mail about services which we feel may be of interest to you. Only Colliers.com (or agents working on behalf of Colliers.com under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. At any time you can easily edit your Colliers.com account information to no longer receive such offers and mailings.

You also have choices with respect to cookies. As mentioned earlier, by modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is about to be set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to edit your newsletter profile. So, as mentioned earlier, if you wish to edit your newsletter profile, make sure that you have not configured your browser so as to reject all cookies.

**7\. How does Colliers.com protect my personal and business-related information?**  
Keeping your information private is vitally important to us. As with all information, Colliers.com will never rent or sell your personal and business-related information to Third Parties without your express permission.

In short, if you post Personal Information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
