# Privacy Policy | CopperEgg

CopperEgg, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“CopperEgg,” “our,” “us,” or “we”) respects your privacy. In that regard, we have created this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect when you visit our website located at copperegg.com (including any forums, the “Website”), or use our proprietary service or such other features, websites or applications offered from time to time (collectively, the “Service”), why we collect it, and how it is used. By using the Website or Service, you consent to the data practices prescribed in this Privacy Policy.

“Personal Information” means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number, or other contact information, whether at work or at home, age information, credit or debit card information. We may ask you to provide Personal Information that will enable us to enhance your use of the Service, or for purposes such as facilitating correspondence with you, registering your entitlement to access certain special features, or to complete transactions. It is always your choice whether or not to provide that Personal Information. If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Service.

Technical Information. We may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to technical information about your device(s), system and application software, and peripherals that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Service. We may also automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, which could include your IP address, cookie information, browser information, and the page you request. This information is not deemed by CopperEgg to constitute Personal Information and while CopperEgg will not use it in a way that associates such information with you, such information it may be aggregated and used. CopperEgg owns this information and may use it in any manner it deems appropriate.

The Personal Information that you provide will be kept confidential. It will be used to process transactions and to support your relationship with CopperEgg and use our products and services.

We internally audit our business practices and procedures, examining confidentiality standards and information access in order to protect your Personal Information.

CopperEgg or its agents or contractors may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of CopperEgg or its agents or contractors; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public.

Finally, if CopperEgg should ever merge with another organization, file for bankruptcy, or sell our assets, we may transfer the information you provide to us on through the Service to a third party or share your Personal Information to the company with which we enter into such transaction as a part of such transaction.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose Personal Information on our message boards or other public forums or features or through e-mail, or in chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting Personal Information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
