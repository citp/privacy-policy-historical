 **Principle 3 - Consent**

The knowledge and consent of an individual are generally required for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information. In certain circumstances personal information can be collected, used or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual, such as in the case of an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual is threatened.

 **3.2** Generally, Intrawest shall seek consent to use and disclose personal information at the same time it collects the information. However, Intrawest may seek consent to use and disclose personal information after it has been collected, but before it is used or disclosed for a new purpose.

 **3.3** Intrawest will require individuals to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information as a condition of the supply of a product or service only if such collection, use or disclosure is reasonably required to fulfill the identified purposes.

 **3.4** In determining the appropriate form of consent, Intrawest shall take into account the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of an individual.

 **3.5** Where consent is required for a particular use or disclosure, an individual may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Individuals may contact Intrawest for more information regarding the implications of withdrawing consent.

 **Principle 4 - Limiting Collection of Personal Information**

Intrawest shall limit the collection of personal information to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by Intrawest and as permitted by law.

e) a credit reporting agency; 

f) a public authority or agent of a public authority, if in the reasonable judgment of Intrawest, it appears that there is imminent danger to life or property which could be avoided or minimized by disclosure of the information; 

g) another entity as part of a merger, a sale of assets or all or part of a business, or any other corporate change or re-organization; 

h) a third party or parties, where the individual consents to such disclosure or disclosure is required or permitted by law. 

**5.2** Only Intrawest employees with a business need to know, or whose duties reasonably so require, are granted access to personal information about individuals.

 **5.3** Depending on the circumstances, where personal information has been used to make a decision about an individual, Intrawest shall retain, for a reasonable period of time, either the actual information or the rationale for making the decision. 

**5.4** Intrawest shall maintain reasonable and systematic controls, schedules and practices for information and records retention and destruction which apply to personal information that is no longer necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or required or permitted by law to be retained. Such information shall be destroyed, erased or made anonymous.

 **5.5** Where appropriate, Intrawest may communicate updates of personal information to third parties. 

**5.6** Intrawest may engage affiliates or third party service providers for the purpose of providing services or processing information on behalf of Intrawest, and we may transfer or disclose personal information to such parties in connection with such purposes. Some divisions, affiliates or third party service providers may be located in other jurisdictions, and information in their custody (i) may or may not be subject to privacy legislation similar to that applicable to Intrawest, and (ii) may be subject to laws applicable in such jurisdictions that permit access to such information by foreign governments or law enforcement agencies or by others. 

**Principle 6 - Accuracy**

Intrawest shall take steps to ensure that personal information is as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is appropriate for its purposes. 

**6.1** Personal information used by Intrawest shall be sufficiently accurate, complete and up-to-date to minimize the possibility that inappropriate information may be used to make a decision about an individual.

 **6.2** Intrawest shall take all reasonable steps to update personal information about individuals as and when reasonably necessary to fulfill the identified purposes or as reasonably requested by the individual.

 **Principle 7 - Security Safeguards  
**  
Intrawest shall protect personal information by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. 

**7.1** Intrawest shall take appropriate and reasonable steps to protect personal information against such risks as loss or theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, modification or destruction.

 **7.2** Intrawest shall take appropriate and reasonable steps to protect personal information disclosed to third parties, for example by contractual agreements stipulating the confidentiality of the information and the purposes for which it is to be used.

 **Principle 8 - Openness**

Intrawest shall make readily available to individuals specific information about its policies and practices relating to the management of personal information.

 **8.1** Copies of the Policy will be made available upon request.

 **8.2** Intrawest shall make information about its policies and procedures easy to understand, including: 

a) the title and addresses of the person or persons accountable for Intrawest's compliance with the Policy and to whom inquiries or complaints can be forwarded; 

b) the means of gaining access to personal information held by Intrawest; and 

c) a description of the type of personal information held by Intrawest, including a general account of its use. 

**Principle 9 - Individual Access**

Upon request, Intrawest shall inform an individual of the existence, use and disclosure of his or her personal information, at a minimal or no cost to the individual. An individual shall be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate.

 **9.1** In certain situations, Intrawest may not be able to provide access to all the personal information that it holds about an individual. For example, Intrawest may not provide access to information if doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party or could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of an individual. Also, Intrawest may not provide access to information if disclosure would reveal confidential commercial information, if the information is protected by solicitor-client privilege, if the information was generated in the course of a formal dispute resolution process, or if the information was collected in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a law. If access to personal information cannot be provided, Intrawest shall, upon request, provide the reasons for denying access.

 **9.2** In order to safeguard personal information, an individual may be required to provide sufficient identification information to permit Intrawest to authorize access to the individual's file. 

**9.3** Individuals can seek access to their personal information by contacting the Privacy Office at Intrawest.

 **9.4** Intrawest will endeavor to respond to all requests within 30 days or, in any event, as required or permitted by applicable law.

An individual shall be able to address a challenge concerning compliance with the above principles to the designated person or persons accountable for Intrawest's compliance with the Policy.

 **10.1** Intrawest shall maintain procedures for addressing and responding to all inquiries or complaints from individuals about Intrawest's handling of personal information.
