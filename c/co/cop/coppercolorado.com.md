Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and we will update it immediately if our policies change.

This notice applies to information you supply to us. The information may be provided via the Resort's websites or at various other locations including points of sale at the Resort. 

The Way We Use Information   
You can register on our website if you would like to receive emails and updates regarding resort events, news, snow conditions or terrain park information. Information you submit on other pages of our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form. 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers.

Finally, Copper Mountain Resort will never use, sell, rent or share the personally identifiable information provided to us to any third party for any reason, except for in certain special cases in which we may disclose your personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to you, or otherwise injuring or interfering with Copper Mountain Resort's rights, property or operations, other Copper Mountain Resort site users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe the law requires it, or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case, administrative investigation or investigation conducted by Copper Mountain Resort. We shall have no obligation to inform you of our compliance with the law, including without limitation a response to a law enforcement request or a valid subpoena.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

Our Commitment to Children's Privacy   
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
