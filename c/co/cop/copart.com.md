**Cookies**

  * We may place a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer, tablet, mobile or handheld device, or any other access device (each an “Access Device”). The cookie itself does not contain personal information although it will enable us to relate your use of this website or a Copart App to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites. Copart may use cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). In addition, Copart uses encrypted cookies to authenticate the user on each page after the user logs onto the website or through a Copart App. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser or through the appropriate “settings” icon of certain Access Devices. If you’ve set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. Some Copart features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.



**Communications**

  * We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to Copart services and your account with Copart, including but not limited to notifications, service announcements, and administrative messages without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them. Should you choose not to receive certain communications your access to or use of certain services may not be possible.



**Data Storage**

  * Copart may store your account information active in our databases indefinitely following the termination of your account with Copart to the maximum extent permitted by law.



**Confidentiality and Security**

  * We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
  * We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.
  * If Copart learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this website, a Copart App, or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this website or a Copart App. Copart may post a notice on our website if a security breach occurs. Copart may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at privacy@copart.com.
  * Copart takes your security seriously and takes reasonable steps to protect your information. No data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The following is a summary of the measures Copart takes to protect your information and descriptions of ways we implement these measures for different types of information you may provide to us:



            o **Secure Socket Layer (SSL)** Copart uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption when transmitting certain kinds of information, such as financial services information or payment information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed on the bottom of most browsers window during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other forms of payment. Any time Copart asks you for a credit card number for payment or for verification purposes, it will be SSL encrypted. The information you provide will be stored securely on our servers. Once you choose to store or enter your credit card number on Copart, it will not be displayed back to you in its entirety when you retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire number, you will only see asterisks and either the first four digits or the last four digits of your number.

            o **Vendors and Partners** Copart works with vendors and partners to protect the security and privacy of user information.

            o **Employee and Contractor Access to Information** Copart limits access to personal information about you to those employees who we reasonably believe need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
