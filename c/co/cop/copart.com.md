                o    We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or
                     take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving
                     potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Copart's terms
                     of use or buyer or seller terms and conditions, or as otherwise required by law.
                o We transfer information about you if Copart is acquired by or merged with
                     another company. In this event, Copart will notify you before information about
                     you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
                o We transfer information about you to sellers of items purchased by you, to buyers
                     of items sold by you and to their service providers that they may retain to

Cookies
     •     Copart may set and access Copart cookies on your computer.
Communications
     •     We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to Copart services and
           your account with Copart, including but not limited to notifications, service
           announcements, and administrative messages without offering you the opportunity to opt-
           out of receiving them.
Data Storage
     •     Copart may store your account information active in our databases indefinitely following
           the termination of your account with Copart.
Confidentiality and Security
     •     We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe
           reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or
           services to you or in order to do their jobs.
     •     We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal
           regulations to protect personal information about you.
     •     Copart takes your security seriously and takes reasonable steps to protect your
           information. No data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology
           can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The following is a summary of the measures
           Copart takes to protect your information and descriptions of ways we implement these
           measures for different types of information you may provide to us:
                o Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
                     Copart uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption when transmitting certain
                     kinds of information, such as financial services information or payment
                     information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed on the bottom of most
                     browsers window during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other
                     forms of payment. Any time Copart asks you for a credit card number for
                     payment or for verification purposes, it will be SSL encrypted. The information
                     you provide will be stored securely on our servers. Once you choose to store or
                     enter your credit card number on Copart, it will not be displayed back to you in its
                     entirety when you retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire number,

                     you will only see asterisks and either the first four digits or the last four digits of
                     your number.
                o Vendors and Partners
                     Copart works with vendors and partners to protect the security and privacy of user
                     information.
                o Employee and Contractor Access to Information
                     Copart limits access to personal information about you to those employees who
                     we reasonably believe need to come into contact with that information to provide
                     products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
                o Education and Training for Employees

                     security that is required of every Copart employee.
