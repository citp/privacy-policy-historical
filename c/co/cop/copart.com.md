                o    We provide the information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal
                     process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims,

Communications
     •     We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to Copart services and
           your account with Copart, including but not limited to notifications, service
           announcements, and administrative messages without offering you the opportunity to opt-
           out of receiving them. Should you choose not to receive certain communications your
           access to or use of certain services may not be possible.
Data Storage
     •     Copart may store your account information active in our databases indefinitely following
           the termination of your account with Copart to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Confidentiality and Security
     •     We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe
           reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or
           services to you or in order to do their jobs.
     •     We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal
           regulations to protect personal information about you.
     •     If Copart learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically
           so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this website or providing
           personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically
           regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this website.
           Copart may post a notice on our website if a security breach occurs. Copart may also
           send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances.
           Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security
           breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw
           your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at
           privacy@copart.com.
     •     Copart takes your security seriously and takes reasonable steps to protect your
           information. No data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology
           can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The following is a summary of the measures
           Copart takes to protect your information and descriptions of ways we implement these
           measures for different types of information you may provide to us:
                o Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
                     Copart uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption when transmitting certain
                     kinds of information, such as financial services information or payment
                     information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed on the bottom of most
                     browsers window during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other
                     forms of payment. Any time Copart asks you for a credit card number for
                     payment or for verification purposes, it will be SSL encrypted. The information
                     you provide will be stored securely on our servers. Once you choose to store or
                     enter your credit card number on Copart, it will not be displayed back to you in its
                     entirety when you retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire number,
                     you will only see asterisks and either the first four digits or the last four digits of
                     your number.

                o Vendors and Partners
                     Copart works with vendors and partners to protect the security and privacy of user
                     information.
                o Employee and Contractor Access to Information
                     Copart limits access to personal information about you to those employees who
                     we reasonably believe need to come into contact with that information to provide
                     products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
                o Education and Training for Employees
                     Copart has implemented a company-wide education and training program about
                     security that is required of every Copart employee.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
     •     Copart may update this policy. When we do, we will also revise the “effective date” on
           the Privacy Policy. For changes to this privacy policy that may be materially less
           restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we
           will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing the change. We encourage you
           to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting
           the Personal Information we collect. Your continued use of this website constitutes your
           agreement to this Privacy Statement and any updates.
