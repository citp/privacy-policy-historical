			<br>
			VIEWING, USE AND/OR COMMUNICATION IS CONSTRUED AS ACCEPTANCE OF THE 
			TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY <br>
			<br>
			Acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy is a portion of the 
			consideration required for your right to visit the Website. &nbsp;If you 
			do not accept the terms of this Privacy Policy in their entirety, 
			you have no right to visit the Website. <br>
			<br>
			ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WinCore Marketing COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS

			<br>
			VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 
			REGISTRATION <br>
			<br>
			For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Registration” means that the 
			Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer, as applicable, takes

			&nbsp;This can include, without limitation, where the individual: (a) 
			registers for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; (b) 
			participates in Visitor surveys; (c) participates in promotions, 
			contests and/or sweepstakes offered by WinCore Marketing; (d) requests 
			information from WinCore Marketing via an online form, email, mail or courier; (e) joins, 
			or attempts to join, an affiliate program or other membership 
			organization sponsored by WinCore Marketing; and/or (f) orders a product 
			through the Website or otherwise from WinCore Marketing. <br>
			<br>
			The information that you must supply in connection with Registration 
			(as further described below) may include, without limitation, some 
			or all of the following: (i) your full name; (ii) company name; 
			(iii) e-mail address; (iv) mailing address (and billing address if 
			different); (v) home telephone number; (vi) work telephone number; 
			(vii) telecopier number; (viii) credit card information; and/or (ix) 
			any other information requested on the applicable Registration form.
			<br>
			<br>
			VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES <br>
			<br>
			Website Visitors that wish to communicate with WinCore Marketing do so 
			under the following conditions: (a) they give their permission to be 
			contacted by WinCore Marketing; and (b) they are subject to any 
			‘submission’ provisions contained in the WinCore Marketing Terms of Use,
			<br>
			WinCore Marketing Purchase Agreement and/or this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;The 
			email address that you use in connection with your inquiry shall be 
			added to the WinCore Marketing database. <br>
			<br>
			CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS <br>
			<br>
			If you are a Customer and you send an email to WinCore Marketing, or if 
			you communicate with WinCore Marketing by phone or U.S. mail, WinCore Marketing 
			shall collect information about your communication and by 
			communicating with WinCore Marketing, you give your permission for WinCore Marketing to collect, archive, retrieve and otherwise use any information 
			collected as WinCore Marketing sees fit. <br>
			<br>
			Any communication which, in its sole discretion, WinCore Marketing deems 
			to be a testimonial, may be publicized for commercial purposes. <br>
			<br>
			INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VOLUNTARY VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER OR 
			CUSTOMER <br>
			SURVEYS <br>
			<br>
			Unless otherwise specified in the survey, you must assume that any 
			information provided to WinCore Marketing as part of a survey in which you 
			participate may be used as set forth hereinbelow. <br>
			<br>
			INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ELECTRONIC MEANS AND COOKIES <br>
			<br>
			We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about 
			you when you visit many of the sections of the Website. &nbsp;This 
			non-personally identifiable information includes, without 
			limitation, the type of browser that you use (e.g., Netscape, 
			Internet Explorer), your IP address, the type of operating system 
			that you use (e.g., Windows or Mac OS) and the domain name of your 
			Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink). We use 
			the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to <br>
			improve the design and content of the Website and to enable us to 
			personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this 
			information in the aggregate to analyze Website usage, as well as to 
			offer you products and services. We also reserve the right to use 
			aggregate or group data about our Visitors for any and all lawful 
			purposes. Aggregate or group data is data that describes the 
			demographics, usage and/or characteristics of our visitors as a 
			group. By visiting and/or supplying your personal information at the 
			Website, you agree to allow us to provide such aggregate data to 
			third parties. <br>
			<br>
			"Cookies" is web jargon for bits of computer code placed on your 
			hard drive. &nbsp;The Website uses cookies to keep you 'logged in,' to 
			keep track of search criteria, to monitor use, to password protect 
			use of the Website and/or to track use of products and/or services 
			sold by and through the Website. &nbsp;Even in the case where a Visitor 
			rejects a cookie, they may still use our Website. &nbsp;The only drawback 
			to this is that the Visitor may be limited in what he/she can access 
			in some areas on our Website. &nbsp;Cookies can also be used to obtain 
			information about your computer configuration or your use of your 
			computer. &nbsp;To find out more about cookies, including how to disable 
			and/or remove cookies, please visit www.cookiecentral.com. <br>
			<br>
			HOW YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE USED <br>
			<br>
			The personal information that you submit to us remains your 
			property, but by submitting such information to us you grant us the 
			right, subject to applicable state and federal law, to use the 
			personal information (other than credit card information) for 
			marketing purposes. &nbsp;Without limiting the generality of the 
			foregoing, we reserve the right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or 
			otherwise distribute any and all personal information with/to any 
			third-party for any and all uses permitted by this Privacy Policy 
			and applicable law. These third parties may include, but shall not 
			be limited to: (a) providers of direct marketing services and 
			applications, including <br>
			lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; 
			(b) e-mail marketers; (c) telemarketers (where permitted by 
			applicable law); (d) SMS text-based marketers (where permitted by 
			applicable law); and (e) direct marketers. &nbsp;We may also use your 
			personal information for any promotion-related purpose, and/or 
			marketing and survey purpose, on our own behalf and on behalf of our 
			affiliates and subsidiaries. We may disclose personal information to 
			third-party agents and independent contractors that help us create 
			and/or operate any promotions, surveys or other offerings. You agree 
			that we may contact you at any time with updates and/or any other 
			information that we may deem appropriate for you to receive in 
			connection with your continued use of the Website and any and all 
			offerings made available therein, or otherwise by WinCore Marketing. <br>
			<br>
			We are able to offer our products and services to you, in part, 
			based on your willingness to be reached by our third-party 
			advertisers. &nbsp;Your personal information (other than credit card 
			information) will be shared with advertisers on an aggregate and 
			non-aggregate basis. &nbsp;We also use contact information from your 
			personal information to send you information about us, our products 
			and services and to contact you about your billing account status. &nbsp; 
			Please keep in mind, though, that we do not control, and are not 
			responsible for, the practices of our third-party advertisers. &nbsp;If 
			you wish to stop receiving future communications from us and/or 
			third party advertisers, or if you wish to prevent the transfer 
			and/or sale of your personal information to third parties (subject 
			to restrictions contained in applicable state and federal law), 
			please see the Opt-Out/Unsubscribe section below. <br>
			<br>
			You agree that by submitting your personal information to WinCore Marketing, you agree to receive e-mail marketing from WinCore Marketing and our 
			third-party advertisers. &nbsp;In addition, you agree that such act 
			constitutes a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application for 
			purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR §310 et 
			seq. (the “ATSR”). With respect to the ATSR, and notwithstanding 
			that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade 
			Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, we retain <br>
			the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the 
			terms of the ATSR. <br>
			<br>
			In addition, by submitting your personal information to WinCore Marketing, 
			you agree to receive mobile marketing including, but not limited to, 
			text-message based marketing, from us and our third party 
			advertisers and marketers (where, and to the extent that, such 
			marketing is permitted by applicable law). &nbsp;As such, notwithstanding 
			that your mobile telephone number may be listed on state and/or 
			federal Do-Not-Call registries, we retain the right to contact you 
			via text-message based marketing in accordance with applicable state 
			and federal law. &nbsp;Further, you agree that we reserve the right to 
			share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute your mobile 
			telephone and other mobile data with/to any third-party for any and 
			all non-marketing uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and 
			applicable law. <br>
			<br>
			We reserve the right to release current or past personal 
			information: (a) in the event that we believe that the Website, and 
			any products, services or other offerings is/are being or has/have 
			been used in violation of this Privacy Policy, the WinCore Marketing Terms 
			of Use, WinCore Marketing Purchase Agreement, or to commit unlawful acts; 
			(b) if the information is subpoenaed; or (c) if any entity 
			comprising WinCore Marketing is sold or acquired. &nbsp;Moreover, you hereby 
			consent to the disclosure of any record or communication to any 
			third-party when we, in our sole discretion, determine the 
			disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing 
			your e-mail address with other third-parties for suppression 
			purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended 
			from time to time. Visitors should also be aware that courts of 
			equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority 
			under certain circumstances to permit personally identifiable 
			information to be shared or transferred to third parties without 
			permission. <br>
			<br>
			We may also supplement the information we collect with information 
			from other sources to assist us in evaluating and improving the 
			Website, our products and/or services, and to determine your 
			preferences so that we can tailor the Website and our products 
			and/or services to your needs. <br>
			<br>
			CREDIT CARD INFORMATION <br>
			<br>
			Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not use your credit card 
			information for any marketing purposes, or transfer same to any 
			third party, other than as set forth in this paragraph. &nbsp; WinCore Marketing may: (a) transfer your credit card information to third party 
			sellers where necessary to effectuate the purchase of products 
			and/or services that you requested on the Website or otherwise from 
			WinCore Marketing; (b) disclose your credit card information pursuant to a 
			court order, litigation and/or fraud investigation; and (c) share 
			with third parties the fact that we have credit card information on 
			file for specific individuals. <br>
			<br>
			INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS 
			OR WEBSITE ADVERTISERS <br>
			<br>
			The Website may contain third party provided banners, pop-ups, 
			hyperlinked advertising and links to other third-party owned and/or 
			operated websites. WinCore Marketing is not responsible for the privacy 
			practices associated with such third party advertisers and/or 
			websites. &nbsp;In some cases, you may be required to provide certain 
			information to register or complete a transaction via such 
			advertisers and/or at such websites. These third-party websites and 
			advertisers have separate privacy and data collection practices and 
			WinCore Marketing has no responsibility or liability relating to them. &nbsp;We 
			do not endorse, nor are we responsible for the accuracy of, the 
			privacy policies and/or terms and conditions of such advertisers 
			and/or websites. &nbsp;These third party entities are independent third 
			parties and are not affiliated with us. <br>
			<br>
			OPT-OUT/UNSUBSCRIBE <br>
			<br>
			When you submit personally identifiable information to us at the 
			Website, you have opted-in to the sharing of your personal 
			information with third parties to receive marketing communications. 
			&nbsp;When contacted by any of these companies or third parties, you 
			should notify them directly of your choices regarding their use and 
			sharing of your information. &nbsp;To opt-out of having your information 
			shared with third parties, please notify us by email at Support@wincoremarketing.com. 
			&nbsp;To stop receiving future e-mail communications from WinCore Marketing, 
			please notify us by email at Support@wincoremarketing.com. &nbsp;WinCore Marketing may 
			maintain separate e-mail lists for different purposes. &nbsp;If e-mail 
			recipients wish to end their e-mail subscription from a particular 
			list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each e-mail 
			message to unsubscribe from the particular list. &nbsp;To unsubscribe 
			from all WinCore Marketing e-mail lists, please notify us by email at 
			Support@wincoremarketing.com. <br>
			<br>
			DATA SECURITY <br>
			<br>
			All collected information is stored in a technically and physically 
			secure environment. &nbsp;When our registration/application process asks 
			users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), 
			and when we store and transmit such sensitive information, it is 
			encrypted and protected with SSL encryption software. &nbsp;While we use 
			SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do 
			everything in our power to protect sensitive information and other 
			personal information off-line. &nbsp;Unfortunately, no <br>
			data transmission over the Internet, or otherwise, can be guaranteed 
			to be 100% secure. &nbsp;As a result, while we strive to protect your 
			sensitive information and other personal information, we cannot 
			ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit 
			to us, and you do so at your own risk. <br>
			<br>
			Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to 
			ensure its security on our systems. Access to this personal 
			information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. 
			&nbsp;All of our users’ personal information, not just sensitive 
			information, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need 
			the information to perform a specific job are granted access to 
			personal information. &nbsp;Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the 
			security and privacy of all WinCore Marketing user personal information. 
			Employees not adhering to our written firm policies are subject to 
			disciplinary action. &nbsp;In compliance with applicable federal and <br>
			state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory 
			agencies in the event that we learn of an information security 
			breach with respect to your personal information. &nbsp;You will be 
			notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. &nbsp;Please be 
			advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of 
			law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to 
			engage in remedial measures. <br>
