The privacy of our visitors to CopperKnob is important to us.<br> 
<br>
At CopperKnob, we recognize that privacy of your personal information is 

important. Here is information on what types of personal information we 

receive and collect when you use and visit CopperKnob, and how we safeguard 

your information.  We never sell your personal information to third parties.<br>
<br>
<b>Log Files</b><br>
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log 

files.  The information in the log files include  your IP (internet protocol) 

address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the 

browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the 

time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site. <br>
<br>
<b>Cookies and Web Beacons</b><br>
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when

features, such as voting.<br>
<br>
We also use third party advertisements on CopperKnob to support our site.  

Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons 

when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such 

as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP 

address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, 

whether you have Flash installed.  This is generally used for geotargeting 

purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for 

example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as 

showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).<br>
