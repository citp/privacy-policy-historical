You can contact individuals at either organisation or at [support [at] copernicus.eu]. Our data protection officer contact details are [frederic.collomb [at] fdc.eu].

With respect to the [Copernicus Observer newsletter](http://copernicus.eu/main/newsletter), your personal data will be retained for as long as you choose to remain subscribed.

All of the information we collect or record is restricted to our offices. Only persons who need the information to fulfil their duties are granted access to personal data. We will explicitly ask you when we need information to identify you. You can update the personal information that you give us at any time by contacting us directly.
