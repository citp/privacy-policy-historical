[](http://privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/Copyright-Clearance-Center/validation?rid=a670a051-838d-4688-8877-e91e43bbe22d "TRUSTe online privacy certification")

Effective: September 10, 2015

This privacy policy applies to [www.copyright.com](https://www.copyright.com/) owned and operated by Copyright Clearance Center (“CCC”). This privacy policy describes how Copyright Clearance Center collects and uses the personal information you provide on our web site: www.copyright.com. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.

## COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

You may access and read most material on CCC’s Web sites without giving us any information that identifies you. However, when you engage in certain activities on these Web sites, such as seeking and receiving permissions, authorizations or licenses to use the copyrighted works of the copyright rightsholders we represent, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself and/or your organization by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to fill out the form and/or engage in these activities. Should you choose not to do so, however, it may not be possible for CCC to provide the permission, authorization or license that you are seeking.

Should you choose to take advantage of our services, we may require that you provide us with personally identifiable information, such as your name, organization name, mailing address, e-mail address and other identifying information. Should you choose to pay with a credit card, you may be asked to provide a card number, expiration date and the name and address of the cardholder. If you add an additional user to your account, we will ask for the additional user’s name, phone number, fax, and e-mail address. For more information about data security, please see the Security section of this Privacy Policy.

CCC collects all of this information in order to record and support your licensing and other activities. For example, we may use the information you provide to verify the details of a license issued to you or to keep you informed about our products and services. We may supplement the information you provide with commercially available demographic and address information in order to enhance our ability to serve you.

Please note that in some cases you may access CCC’s services through the Web site of a participating copyright rightsholder, such as a publisher, or one of our integration partners, such as a course management system provider. In those cases, you will be directed to a Web page within a CCC Web site, and it is CCC that will be collecting your information, even though you may continue to see the copyright rightsholder’s branding or logo. CCC will share information with the copyright rightsholder as described in the Use of Personally Identifiable Information section of this Privacy Policy.

## USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

CCC shares the information that you provide to us in accordance with our obligations to copyright rightsholders to identify uses of their copyrighted materials. These obligations vary from CCC program to program. Details about such obligations under any particular CCC program are available upon request. CCC does NOT, however, share information with copyright rightsholders (i) about credit card details, or (ii) about the use of OTHER copyright rightsholders’ copyrighted materials.

If you have identified yourself, or are identified by your employer to CCC as being associated with a CCC-participating organization, you may receive promotional communications from CCC either directly from us or through your participating organization. Further, when you use your organization’s credit card or CCC billing account to transact business with us, the organization will receive information about the materials you have used and reported to CCC. Similarly, in circumstances where multiple individuals associated with the same organization share a single CCC account or a single user name and password, each individual may have access to information provided by the other individuals on the same account.

Please note that we may use outside shipping and printing companies to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies are not authorized by CCC to retain, share, store or use the personally identifiable information that they receive from CCC for any other purposes. These companies are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

Some of our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to / from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our site. Please be aware that you are providing your personal information to these third parties and not to CCC.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process.

If CCC is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.

CCC recognizes and appreciates the importance of the responsible use of your personally identifiable information. Except as disclosed above or in published lists of consenting customers, we do not release or sell lists of our customer names to outside organizations. Further, your personally identifiable information is password-protected to prevent unauthorized access to it. Finally, when you submit personally identifiable information to CCC, you understand and agree that CCC and its subsidiaries, affiliates and trusted vendors may transfer, store and process your customer profile in any country in which we do business, including but not limited to the United States.

Please be advised that CCC is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any other Web sites to which copyright.com or any other CCC Web site may link.

CCC adheres to generally accepted industry standards to protect this information, both during transmission and once we receive it. These standards include the use of leading hardware and software applications. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your applicable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
