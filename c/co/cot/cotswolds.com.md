# Privacy Policy

### **1.   Introduction**

**Cotswolds Tourism is strongly committed to safeguarding your privacy.   This Privacy Policy explains our policy for the collection and use of information about you and your transactions with us.**

We reserve the right to make changes to this Policy at any time. Your continued use of our products, applications, services and websites that are subject to this Policy will signify your acceptance of any and all changes to this Policy made by us from time to time.

Cotswolds Tourism is the data controller in connection with any personal information collected or received by us arising from your use of any of our products, services, applications, websites and customer support communications.

### **2.   How we use your personal data**

In this section we have set out:

  * the general categories of personal data that we may process
  * the purposes for which we may process personal data; and
  * the legal basis for the processing



We will process your personal data in accordance with the United Kingdom's Data Protection Legislation. We maintain strict security standards and procedures with a view to preventing unauthorised access to your data by anyone, including our staff. We use leading technologies such as (but not limited to) data encryption, fire walls and server authentication to protect the security of your data. All of our staff and any third parties we hire to provide support services will be required to observe our privacy standards and to allow us to audit them for compliance. 

#### **2.1 Online Bookings**

When you book accommodation or buy attraction/event tickets, our order form asks you to give us information specific to that order, including your billing address, shipping address, credit card information and email address. The information that you provide is processed for the purpose of supplying the purchased goods and services and keeping proper records of those transactions. We also use the information to contact you if there is a problem with your order.  The legal basis for this processing is the performance of a contract between you and us and/or taking steps, at your request, to enters into such a contract and our legitimate interests, namely our interest in the proper administration of our website and business.

All of our transactions automatically take place on a secure server. All of your personal information is encrypted before it is transmitted over the Internet.

#### **2.2 Visitor Profiling & Statistics **

When you buy from us online, our system automatically gathers purchase data.

We use this information in two ways: We review what kinds of products and services appeal most to our visitors as a group. This statistical information helps us improve our offerings in the same way that other companies change their catalogue based on what sells best. We use information such as the number of purchases visitors make and the categories of goods and services they buy to make offers to them we believe will be of interest. We do not give out any information about you, as an individual, to anyone, except to complete your transactions, or to comply with valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order.

The legal basis for this processing is legitimate interest.

#### **2.3 Marketing**

We may process information that you provide to us for the purpose of brochure requests, e-newsletters subscriptions and competition entry.  This data may be processed for the purposes of sending you the relevant notifications and media. 

  * E-newsletters - by completing our e-newsletter signup page you are agreeing to receive email marketing communications.  These can be unsubscribed from at any time, simply by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email. 
  * Brochure requests - by completing our Brochure Request form you are agreeing to receive brochures from us.
  * Competitions - please check the individual terms and conditions associated with each competition. 



The legal basis for this processing is consent.

In this Section we have summarised the rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries.  Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.

Your principal rights under data protection law are:

(a)        the right to access;  
(b)        the right to rectification;  
(c)        the right to erasure;  
(d)        the right to restrict processing;  
(e)        the right to object to processing;
