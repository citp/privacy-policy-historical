                                       Cotton Babies Privacy Policy
Cotton Babies, Inc. (“Cotton Babies”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
describes Cotton Babies’ practices in connection with the information that we collect through our
websites or mobile applications owned and controlled by Cotton Babies as well as offline where notice is
legally required. By providing personal information to Cotton Babies, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
Collection of Your Personal Information
At some Cotton Babies sites, we ask you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address,
name, home or work address, or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such
as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests, and favorites. If you choose to make a purchase, we
will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address, which is used to
process your order. In order to access some Cotton Babies services, you will be asked to sign in with an
e-mail address and password. By signing in on one Cotton Babies’ site or service, you may be
automatically signed into other Cotton Babies’ sites and services.
We may collect information about your interaction with Cotton Babies sites and services. For example,
we may use Web site analytics tools on our site to retrieve information from your browser, including the
site you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find our site, the pages you view
within our site, your browser add-ons, and your browser’s width and height. We may also use
technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click, and
other actions you take on our sites and services. Additionally, we collect certain standard information that
your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access
times, and referring Web site addresses. We also may deliver advertisements and utilize Web site
analytics tools (see the Display of Advertising section below).
When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mail from Cotton Babies, we may use customized links,
or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in
order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information.
In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Cotton
Babies, information collected through one Cotton Babies service may be combined with information
obtained through other Cotton Babies services. We may also supplement the information we collect with
information obtained from other companies. For example, we may use services from other companies
that enable us to derive a general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain
services to your geographic area.
Use of Your Personal Information
Cotton Babies collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve its sites and services.
These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service; making the sites or services
easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing
research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services, and technologies; and displaying content
and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences. For more information about the use
of information for advertising, see the Display of Advertising section below.
We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory
service communications such as welcome letters, order-related communications, information on technical
service issues, and security announcements. Some Cotton Babies services may send periodic
correspondence that are considered part of the service. Additionally, with your permission, we may send
you information about other Cotton Babies products and services.
1646034.3


Sharing of Your Personal Information
Except as described in this policy, we will not disclose your personal information outside of Cotton
Babies and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent. See the Communication
Preferences section below for more information.
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the
processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing
transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those service providers will be permitted
to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the
confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. However, for
credit card processing, our fraud detection vendors may use aggregate data to help improve their service.
This helps them more accurately detect fraudulent uses of credit cards. We may access or disclose
information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the
law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Cotton Babies or
our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the
services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal
safety of Cotton Babies employees, customers, or the public. We may also disclose personal information
as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.
Accessing Your Personal Information
You might have the ability to view or edit your personal information online. In order to help prevent your
personal information from being viewed by others, you will be required to sign in with your credentials
(e-mail address and password). The appropriate method(s) for accessing your personal information will
depend on which sites or services you have used.
•   Cottonbabies.com - You can access and update your profile on cottonbabies.com by visiting the
    Cottonbabies.com Profile Center.
•   Cotton Babies Billing and Account Services - If you have a Cotton Babies Billing account, you can
    add to or update your information at the Cotton Babies Billing Web site by clicking on the “Personal
    Information” or “Billing Information” links.
Some Cotton Babies sites or services may collect personal information that is not accessible via the links
above. However, in such cases, you may be able to access that information through alternative means of
access described by the service. Or you can write us by using our Web form, and we will contact you
within 30 days regarding your request.
Communication Preferences
You can stop the delivery of future promotional materials from Cotton Babies sites and services by
following the specific instructions in the materials you receive or by contacting us via e-mail at
contactus@cottonbabies.com.
This choice does not apply to the display of online advertising. Nor does it apply to the receipt of
mandatory service communications that are considered part of certain Cotton Babies services, which you
may receive periodically unless you cancel the service.
Display of Advertising
Many of the Web sites and online services we offer, as well as those of our partners, are supported by
advertising. Through the Cotton Babies Advertising Platform, we may display ads on our own sites and
the sites of our advertising partners.
                                                       2


When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more persistent cookies on your
computer in order to recognize your computer each time we display an ad to you. The cookies we use for
advertising have an expiry date of no more than 2 years. Because we may serve advertisements on many
different Web sites, we are able to compile information over time about where you, or others who are
using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements we display. We use this information to
make predictions about your characteristics, interests, or preferences and to display targeted
advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you. We may also associate this information with
your subsequent visit, purchase, or other activity on participating advertisers’ Web sites in order to
determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.
While we may use some of the information we collect in order to personalize the ads we show you, we
designed our systems to select ads based only on data that does not personally and directly identify you.
For example, we may select the ads we display according to certain general interest categories or
segments that we have inferred based on (a) demographic or interest data, including any you may have
provided when creating an account (e.g. age, zip or postal code, gender), demographic or interest data
acquired from other companies, and a general geographic location derived from your IP address, and
(b) the pages you view and links you click when using Cotton Babies’ and its advertising partners’ Web
sites and services. For more information about how we target ads, visit Personalized Advertising from
Cotton Babies.
Although the majority of the online advertisements on Cotton Babies sites are displayed by Cotton
Babies, we also allow third-party ad serving companies, including other ad networks, to display
advertisements on our sites.
Security of Your Personal Information
Cotton Babies is committed to protecting the security of your personal information and information
collected for advertising purposes. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help
protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the
personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in
controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or
password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer
(SSL) protocol.
If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to
keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a
computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your
information from subsequent users.
Collection and Use of Children’s Personal Information
Cotton Babies is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and
guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities. Cotton Babies does not target its Web
sites or mobile applications to children less than thirteen (13) years of age or knowingly collect
information from such children for the purpose of selling products or services. Cotton Babies may
participate in select programs in support of schools and communities.
Use of Cookies
Cotton Babies Web sites use “cookies” to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize
your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page
server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the
cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
                                                       3


One of the primary purposes of cookies is to store your preferences and other information on your
computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and
to display your personalized content and appropriate advertising on your later visits to these sites. Cotton
Babies Web sites also use cookies as described in the Collection of your Information and Display of
Advertising sections of this privacy policy.
When you sign in to a site using your Cotton Babies Network credentials, we store your unique ID
number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to
move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out,
these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to improve the sign in experience.
For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you
sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type
your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not otherwise want this
information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie
will not be used.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but
you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Cotton Babies sites and
services that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not
be able to be respected.
Controlling Unsolicited E-mail (“Spam”)
Cotton Babies is concerned about controlling unsolicited commercial e-mail, or “spam.” Cotton Babies
will not sell, lease or rent its e-mail subscriber lists to third parties. While Cotton Babies continues to
actively review and implement new technology, such as expanded filtering features, there is no currently
available technology that will totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited e-mail. Using junk
e-mail tools and being cautious about the sharing of your e-mail address while online will help reduce the
amount of unsolicited e-mail you receive.

your information.
