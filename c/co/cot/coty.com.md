**_What Personal Information Does Coty Gather?_**  
The information Coty learns from customers helps us continually improve the services we provide to you. Here are the types of information we gather. 

  * **_Information You Give Us_** : Coty receives and stores any information you enter on our Web sites or give us in any other way. However, you can choose not to provide certain information. However, if you do so, then you might not be able to take full advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future visits based on your interests, awarding prizes for sweepstakes/contests, improving our service and communicating more effectively with you.
  *  ** _Automatic Information_** : Coty receives and stores certain types of information automatically whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use �cookies.� In that way, we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our site. There are a number of companies that offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although Coty will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, you should be aware that these disabling tools exist.

  
**_What Are Cookies?_**

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that Coty transfers to your computer�s hard drive through your Web browser. They enable our systems to recognize your browser. If we recognize you, Coty can provide more customized or personalized features each time you log on to one of our brand websites.
  * The �help� portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and/or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our sites� features. Coty recommends that you leave them turned on.
  * It is possible that some of Coty�s business partners may also use cookies on our websites. However, Coty has no access to, or control over, these cookies. Therefore, we do not accept any responsibility for such use.

**_What About Pixel Tags?_**  
When you visit Coty�s websites or view one of our e-mails, we may use pixel tags (also called �clear gifs�), tracking links and/or similar technology to note some of the pages you visit on our websites.
