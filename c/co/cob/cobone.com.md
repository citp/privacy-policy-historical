The COBONE team members are customers themselves of other Internet sites and fully appreciate and respect the importance of privacy on the Internet. We will not disclose information about our customers to third parties except where it is part of providing a service to you - e.g. arranging for a product to be sent to you, carrying out credit and other security checks and for the purposes of customer research and profiling or where we have your express permission to do so.

You may opt out of these communications at any point, as per this privacy policy.

  * Name and contact details
  * Transaction history

We will not sell your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information or personal information to any third party without your permission, but we cannot be responsible or held liable for the actions of third party sites from which you may have linked or been directed to the COBONE website.

**Communication & Marketing**  
If you have registered on COBONE we will update you on our daily deals, news and special offers via e-mail, post or telephone.

We may share your information with COBONE Merchants. From time to time, we provide offers from particular merchants (referred to as “COBONE Merchants”) who, as part of the offer, request information on COBONE customers who purchased the offer in order to aid redemption. In those cases, we share some of your Personally Identifiable Information with COBONE Merchants. Sharing this Information may allow a COBONE Merchant to market directly to you should they choose to do so. However, we will only share Personally Identifiable Information with a COBONE Merchant if you engage in an Identification Activity, and then only to the COBONE Merchant involved in that Identification Activity. We specifically disclaim any responsibility or liability for the actions of such COBONE Merchant. While we inform them that they are only permitted to communicate with you for the purposes of the specific promotion with COBONE, we do not have any responsibility for the actions of the COBONE Merchant, and the actions of the COBONE Merchant are not in our control.

These types of files do a number of different jobs such as remembering your preferences and chosen items, assisting you to improve your site experience as well as trying to ensure that the adverts or offers you see online are more relevant to you. These “cookies” can be divided into 4 types each of which is outlined below.

The data stored by these cookies never shows personal details from which your individual identity can be established.

**Category 3: Functionality Cookies**  
These remember choices you make such as language, deal interests or currency. These can then be used to provide you with an experience more appropriate with your selections and make the visits more tailored and pleasant. The information is also merged with other users on an anonymous basis to enable us to improve how the site operates.

**Category 4: Targeting Cookies or Advertising Cookies**  
These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests. They remember the websites you have visited and that information is shared with other parties such as advertisers.

  * in the event that COBONE sells or buys any business or assets;
  * if COBONE or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data which we hold about our customers may be one of the transferred assets; or

If you wish to verify the details you have submitted to COBONE you may do so by contacting us via the e-mail address or address given below.

You must therefore keep this information safe as you will be responsible for any action which we take in response to a request from someone using your e-mail and password. We would strongly recommend that you do not use the browser's password memory function as that would permit other people using your terminal to access your personal information.

We are always grateful for any time you spend providing us with the knowledge we need to ensure our customers are completely satisfied - we want you to return to the site and to recommend us to your friends and family.
