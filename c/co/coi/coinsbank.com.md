#### 5\. Disclosure of information

We will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below.

These are some of the ways that your information may be disclosed:

**Service Providers**  
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including Website development and operation, sending postal mail or email, analyzing website use, processing payments, providing investor information and processing data. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are contractually prohibited from using that information for any other reason. 

To make an informed decision on whether to provide your personal data to the Company using this website, **we need to make you aware of four organizations that act as Data Processors for us in the provision of our services to you:**

  * CB EXCHANGE LP, a provider of operational maintenance of the Website, registered in the United Kingdom;
  * NANOKARD K/S, a provider of processing services and maintenance of electronic wallets, registered in Denmark;
  * Truevo Payments Ltd., E-commerce service provider, registered in Malta;
  * CARDPAY Ltd., E-commerce service provider, registered in Cyprus.



**Data in the Aggregate**  
We may disclose "blinded" aggregated data and user statistics to prospective partners and other third parties. Blinded data is data that does not identify an individual person. 

**Other**  
We also may disclose your information in special cases, for example, when we believe that we must disclose information to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service Agreement, or may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other website users or customers, or anyone else who may be harmed by such activities. We may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service and improve our products and services.  
As we continue to develop our business, we may buy or sell businesses or assets. In such transactions, confidential customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event of a transaction involving the sale of some or all of CoinsBank business, customer and site visitor information may be one of the transferred assets and may be disclosed in connection with negotiations relating to a proposed transaction. In such case, the transferred information may become subject to a different privacy policy. 

### Security

#### 6\. How do we keep your information safe?

We use multiple security measures to ensure confidentiality your information. We aim to only keep your information for as long as we need it.  
We store your hard copy and electronic records in secure buildings and systems. Access to your personal information is permitted only for CoinsBank authorized employees.

**System security**  
When you log into our Website or apps, we encrypt data sent from your computer to our systems so no one else can access it. We have firewalls, intrusion detection and virus scanning tools to stop viruses and unauthorized people accessing our systems.  
We use Secure Sockets Layered (SSL) technology to ensure that your information is fully encrypted and sent across the Internet securely.  
We use PCI DSS encryption technology for payment card numbers, passwords, and registration information. Every session required for Two Factor Authentication, is an extra layer of security that requires not only a password and username on your login at CoinsBank. 

#### 7\. How can you control your personal information?

We offer our customers choices for the collection, use and sharing of personal information. You may contact us at [support@coinsbank.com](mailto:support@coinsbank.com) if you wish to edit your private information and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate your request. If you believe that any inaccurate or inappropriate information has been obtained or provided to others through your use of this website, you should contact a representative of CoinsBank at [info@coinsbank.com](mailto:info@coinsbank.com). 

#### 8\. How does COINSBANK protect financial-related information?

Keeping your personal financial information private is very important to us. As a matter of policy and long-time business practice, we do not sell information provided by our users. Any user statistics that we may provide to prospective partners regarding financial matters are provided in the aggregate only and do not include any personally identifiable information about any individual user or corporate user.

#### 9\. What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?

Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account by using your computer when you are away from it. Because information sent through the Internet travels from computer to computer throughout the world, when you give us information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country where you originally entered the information.  
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Information that you disclose by use of the Website (as with any site that is non-secure), by posting a message or using e-mail, potentially could be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties or use of such information by third parties for their own purposes, legal or illegal. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. 

#### 10\. DO YOU GET INFORMED ABOUT PERSONAL DATA BREACH?

**When do we need to tell you about personal breach?**  
In the case of a personal data breach, we shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify. If a breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, we must inform you directly and without undue delay. 

**What is a personal data breach?**  
A personal data breach means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data. This includes breaches that are the result of both accidental and deliberate causes. It also means that a breach is more than just about losing personal data. 

Personal data breaches can include:

  * access by an unauthorised third party;
  * deliberate or accidental action (or inaction) by a controller or processor;
  * sending personal data to an incorrect recipient;
  * computing devices containing personal data being lost or stolen;
  * alteration of personal data without permission;
  * loss of availability of personal data.
