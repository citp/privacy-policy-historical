We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.

#### How we share personal information with other coins.ph users

To process your payments, we may share some of your personal information with the person or company that you are paying or that is paying you. Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received from verified coins.ph users, and whether you have verified control of a bank account are provided to other coins.ph users who you transact with through coins.ph. In addition, this and other information may also be shared with third parties when you use these third parties to access coins.ph services. Unless you have agreed to it, these third parties are not allowed to use this information for any purpose other than to facilitate your transactions using coins.ph services. 

If you are buying goods or services and pay using coins.ph, we may also provide the seller with your shipping and confirmed billing address to help complete your transaction with the seller.

To facilitate dispute resolutions, we may provide a buyer with the seller’s address so that goods can be returned to the seller. 

We work with third parties, including merchants, to enable them to accept or facilitate payments from or to you using coins.ph. In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number to inform you that a payment is sent to you or when you attempt to pay that merchant or through that third party. We use this information to confirm that you are a coins.ph customer and that bitcoin as a form of payment can be enabled, or where a payment is sent to you, to send you notification that you have received a payment.

Please note that merchants you buy from and contract with have their own privacy policies, and coins.ph cannot be held responsible for their operations, including, but not limited to, their information practices. 

  


#### How we share personal information with other parties

We may share your personal information with: 

  * Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing and technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
  * Financial institutions with which we partner.
  * Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. You will receive prior notice of any change in applicable policy.)
  * Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when:
    * We are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure; or
