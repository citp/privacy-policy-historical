# Privacy – Coinhive – Monero Mining Club

## Privacy

We respect your privacy. We only keep track of the absolute minimum of information that is necessary to operate this service.

## JavaScript Miner, Captcha, Shortlinks

  * We **do not** track users. We **do not** use cookies for purposes other than to store an opt-in token. We **do not** use any third party tracking (Google Analytics, Piwik, …).
  * We **never** load any resources from hosts other than Coinhive's own. For example, we **do not** load any Fonts from Google Fonts, neither do we use a CDN for JavaScript sources.
  * We keep your IP address on our servers in working memory (RAM) only. In case of a missbehaving client, the IP address will be kept in RAM for at most 48h. All other IP adresses are purged shortly after you disconnect from our servers.
  * We **do not** store your IP address.
  * We may use `localStorage()` to synchronize miners across multiple browser tabs. A random ID and timestamp is stored in the browser. This information **never** leaves the browser.
  * For the JavaScript Miner, a website owner may choose to disclose your user name or user id on that website to our servers. In this case, your user name/id will be stored alongside the number hashes solved. No other information is stored on our servers.
