# Privacy Policy | coinonx

Welcome to Coinonx (“Coinonx,” “we” or “us”). We recognize that your privacy is very important and take it seriously. This Privacy Policy describes Coinonx’s policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use the services, websites, and applications offered by Coinonx (collectively, the “Services”). By using the Services, you consent to our use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We will not use or share your personal information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources.

**Information We Collect and How We Use It**

Coinonx collects personal information to provide you with a personalized, useful and efficient experience. The categories of information we collect can include:

_Information You Directly Provide to Us_

There are many occasions when you provide information that may enable us to identify you personally (“Personally Identifiable Information”) while using the Services, such as when you sign up for an account, verify your identity or your status as an Accredited Investor or Qualified Purchaser, provide account information or provide us with access to your profiles on third party sites such as angel.co. Personally, Identifiable Information we collect may include, without limitation, your email address, name, phone number, birthday, age, address, Social Security number and/or taxpayer identification number, investment objectives, investment experience, and your educational or professional history.

We may use your email address to send you newsletters, updates about the Service, and Services-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. You can control receipt of certain Services-related messages on your Coinonx Settings page. We may also use your contact information to send you marketing messages from us or our affiliates. If you do not want to receive such messages, you may opt out by following the instructions in the message. (Please note it may take up to one week to process any opt-out requests.) If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses.

_Information from other sources_

We may obtain information from other sources, such as our affiliates, our partners who provide a joint service, third-party information providers, or through mergers and acquisitions, and combine this with information previously collected. In these cases, our Privacy Policy governs the handling of the combined personal information.

_Information We Collect Automatically through Cookies and Other Tracking Technology_

We collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your usage of the Services, including the pages and articles and presentations you viewed, time spent using certain features of the website, demographic data such as server locations, connection speed, and other information that does not identify you (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information” and collectively with the Personally Identifiable Information, the “Data”). Like most online services, we may use cookies, log files, clear GIFs, tracking pixels, web beacons, and other technologies some of which are detailed below.

Cookies: When you visit the Services, we may send one or more “cookies“– small data files – to your computer to uniquely identify your browser and let us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Site. A cookie may convey anonymous information about how you browse the Services to us but does not collect personal information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your computer after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

Log Files: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use the Services, our servers automatically record certain information your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

Clear GIFs Information: When you use the Services, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons or tracking pixels) to anonymously track online usage patterns. No Personally Identifiable Information from your AngelList account is collected using these clear GIFs. In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information collected is used to enable more accurate reporting and make Coinonx better for our users.

Location Data: Depending on your device settings, we may also collect your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device, or we may be able to approximate a device’s location by analyzing other information, like an IP address.

Third Party Services: We may use third party services such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel or Zoho to help understand use of the Services. Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Zoho collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address. Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Zoho also receive this information and their use of it is governed by their respective privacy policies. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our users, we may not respond to Do Not Track signals set by your browser at this time.

Such third parties may use their own cookies or other methods to collect information about you.
