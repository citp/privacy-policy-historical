Our purpose for the aforesaid collection of information is for us to understand the preference of our visitors and users so as to enhance and facilitate the ease with which you are able to access or use our Website and our Site Services. 

2.2 As part of the Anonymised Data that we collect, when you access our Website via your mobile device or tablet, we will also collect information regarding the type of mobile device or tablet that you are utilising so that our Website, App and/or Site Services can provide you with the version of our Website and/or App best suited for access on your mobile device or tablet. 

2.3 If you do not consent to our collection of Anonymised Data, please adjust the settings on your computer, tablet and mobile device to block or disable our use of the Acceptable Technologies. In the event that you choose to access our Website or our Site Services without blocking or disabling or opting out of the Acceptable Technologies, such access by you will constitute your consent to our use of the Acceptable Technologies and our collection of information thereto. 

2.4 To better assist you in understanding the generally Accepted Technologies used in our collection of Anonymised Data include:-   
2.4.1 “IP Address” refers to a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you access the Internet. Under certain circumstances, your IP Address remains the same from browser session to browser session. However, in the event that a consumer Internet access provider is utilised, your IP Address will likely vary from session to session. We track IP Addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyse the flow of webpages on our Website.   
2.4.2 “Cookies” refer to small pieces of data that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive or mobile device’s internal storage while you are viewing the said website. Our Website utilises both session cookies (they expire the moment your Internet browser is closed) and persistent cookies (they will remain in your computer until you actively take steps to delete them) so as to provide you with a more personalised and interactive experience on our Website. By changing the options on your Internet browser and adjusting the settings in your mobile device (subject to your version of operation system and your device’s features), you can control whether to accept or decline cookies.   
2.4.3 “Clear GIFs” refer to clear electronic images that are used to track your opening of webpages on our Website and your pattern of browsing our webpages as well as your access of our Website, for the purpose of allowing us to assess the attractiveness of the content on our Website, and the flow of webpages and layouts that appeal to you. Clear GIFs are also commonly known as "web beacons" and may be included on our Website, and generally works in conjunction with cookies to identify users and user behaviour. Some of our HTML based emails also utilise Clear GIFs in order for us to assess what are the emails we sent that have been opened and acted upon. Clear GIFs collect only limited data, such as a cookie number, the time and date of when a particular webpage, feature or service on our Website is accessed, and a description of the webpage, feature or service on our Website in which the clear GIF resides. Such collected Anonymised Data helps us to determine the effectiveness of the way our webpages, features and services are arranged on our Website, our modes of communications and promotional campaigns.   
2.4.4 "Third-party web analytics" refer to services provided by third party service providers for the assessment, analysis, measurement and reporting of the behaviour of visitors to a website in order to assess and improve the effectiveness of the website. One of the most well-known third-party analytics service is "Google Analytics".   
2.4.5 “HTML5 local storage” refer to caching services utilizing primarily a cache manifest file, which allows for storage of your preferences offline which will then be updated and synchronized when you go online.   
2.4.6 “Dynamic device identifiers” refer to “identifier for advertisers” or “IFA”, which is a random, anonymous number assigned to an end-user of the iPhone or iPad and is temporary, allowing it to be blocked like a cookie. When an end-user views an application or browses the internet, the end-user’s presence generates a call for an advertisement as the publisher’s site that the end-user is viewing will pass the IFA to the ad server and the advertiser is then able to serve the end-user with an advertisement relevant to the topic being viewed. IFA can also be used to identify whether the advertisements resulted in end-users downloading applications or purchasing products that were advertised. The IFA does not identify the end-user personally, it provides an aggregated audience data that advertisers can target with advertisements. IFA can be opted out of via the settings in the end-user’s device (by default, the IFA is enabled), subject to the availability of such options in the version of your operating system and the features of your device.   


2.5 In the event that you decide in your sole discretion and risk to use any of the token swap functions available on our Site (which includes but are not limited to KyberWidget and 0x), your ETH Address will be exposed. If you do not accept the potential risk, please do not use any swap functions or perform any token swaps on our Site.
