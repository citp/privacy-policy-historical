<h1>Coinzilla Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="line-bellow"></div>
<p>
We, <strong>Sevio FZC</strong>, along with our Affiliates ("<strong>Coinzilla</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", or "<strong>our</strong>"), have a great concern for the privacy of our customers.
</p>
<p>
Our privacy policy ("<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>") details the procedures involved in collecting , processing, using, and disclosing the data that is collected through our website, <strong>www.coinzilla.com</strong>, or any other digital property of <strong>Coinzilla</strong> exhibiting this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Sites"), as well as our content-discovery platforms, analytics tools, feeds, widgets, and other software system tools that may be provided through our Sites or via third-party websites (collectively, the "<strong>Services</strong>").
</p>
<p>
Read this information carefully so that you understand how we process personal data and what your rights are.
</p>
<p>
We may collect data from or about you or your device, including personal information ("<strong>Information</strong>") when you visit the Sites, or use or interact with any of our Services, and this Information will be processed as explained in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
The data we've collected through our Sites and Services may be used in various ways, in accordance with your status as (<strong>i</strong>) a publisher, advertiser, or another content provider who is in a contractual agreement with Coinzilla, ("<strong>Customer</strong>"); (<strong>ii</strong>) visitor of our Customers' websites and digital properties that are associated with our Services ("<strong>User</strong>"); or (<strong>iii</strong>) a visitor of <strong>coinzilla.com</strong> ("<strong>Site Visitor</strong>"), that belongs to the Customer or the prospective customer category.
</p>
<p>
Consequently, the relevant information for each of these main categories has been segregated into three different sections that are featured below. The Information which concerns and applies to all three of the aforementioned categories is included in our Privacy Policy, in Section 4.

<strong>1. Customers</strong><br>

<p>
<strong> 1.1 Information Collected from Customers ("Customer Information")</strong>
</p>
<p>
Customer Information represents data which we directly collect from our Customers. For instance, a Customer's contact details will be collected by us upon entering a contractual agreement with Coinzilla, or we might save a Customer's username and password during the account registration on any of our Sites. We will also collect the information submitted to us by the Customer when he sends an e-mail containing inquiries or agrees to sign up to our e-mail newsletters. We may also collect other Information that has been provided to us on the Customers' own accord (for instance, the contents of a message sent to us via our Sites or e-mail). Information from potential Customers may also be collected by us through the use of publicly available sources.
</p>
<p>
If a Customer signs up to use our Services or uses Coinzilla's "Display" analytics dashboard, we may collect information such as the Customer's name, e-mail address, telephone number, billing details, and any other data that are provided to us by the Customer while using the platform. Payments to or from our Customers may also be processed on our behalf through collaborations with third-party vendors.
</p>

This type of communication may entail the use of cookies in our e-mails so that we can track when the e-mails are opened and also evaluate the performance of our campaigns. For additional information on our cookies, please visit our <a href="cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a>.
</li>
<li>

</p>
<p>
We may collect User Information that includes, but is not limited to:
</p>
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li>
data regarding the device and operating system of the User;
</li>
<li>
IP address;
</li>

<p>
<strong>2.2	How Our User Information Is Used</strong>

<p>
Our collected User Information may be used for the purposes featured down below:
</p>
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li>

</li>
<li>
<strong>Content Personalization for Multiple Devices.</strong> For the purpose of offering an improved user experience for an all-encompassing variety of browsers and devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, PCs) with better-targeted ad campaigns. We aim to provide the same quality and user experience and personalized content whether you are using a web browser or a mobile app. To achieve this, we may sync cookies and identifiers with our service providers or Customers that already have this implementation, so that our Users can benefit from improved data and data segments, and gain insight of other customers from the market.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Providing Data Segments for Targeting Content and Advertisements for Services of Possible Interest.</strong> We may provide our Customers with several data segments (groups of Users with common attributes) either from us or from our data partners (accredited or authorized institutions are able to request such documents) to help them gain exposure to Users that have a higher chance of showing interest in their content and ads. When forming segments, we do not base our creation process on sensitive information (e.g., race, ethnicity, religious affiliations, or health status, genetic or biometric data, sex life or sexual preferences). Our Customers may use, via our Services, several <a href="https://docs.coinzilla.com/standard-health-segments.pdf">standard health-related segments</a> which focus on non-sensitive issues that mostly concern general health and well-being or over the counter treatments. We may also provide <a href="https://docs.coinzilla.com/standard-finance-segments.pdf">standard finance-related segments</a> that are about Users who have an interest in financial services.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<strong>Third Parties with No Affiliation.</strong> User Information may be disclosed to other third parties that hold no affiliation with Coinzilla, such as (i) our data partners (accredited or authorized institutions are able to request such documents), so that we can enable our advertisers to offer targeted content to specific audience segments, and (ii) our programmatic demand and supply partners (accredited or authorized institutions are able to request such documents) so that we can offer personalized advertisements.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Customers.</strong> User Information may be disclosed to the Customers that have a Service we think might benefit from such information.

</p>
<p>
<strong>2.5	Interest-Based Advertising</strong>
</p>
<p>
We may provide advertisements to you via our Services and the Services provided to our Customers in accordance with your recent browsing behavior across various Customer platforms, browsers, or devices.
 </p>
<p>
For example, if you first visit a certain website, then the next websites you will be visiting will feature content personalized related to the content of the first website you have accessed.
</p>
<p>
We may employ the use of cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), HTML5 local storage, and other technologies in order to provide you with relevant advertisements about products and services that are of possible interest to you. Please read our Cookie Policy to find out more information regarding the technologies we use.
</p>
<p>
Third parties, such as ad networks, may also be used to display advertisements derived from your online browsing behavior. This will enable advertisers to present advertisements that target items and services with relation to your interests.
</p>
<p>
In order to measure the effectiveness of ads and personalized contents for you, our third-party ad networks, advertiser Customers (and their affiliate content providers and agents), and/or traffic tracking services may also employ the use of technologies, including, but not limited to, cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (as well as clear GIFs), and Flash LSOs. The privacy policy which these third-party cookies and other technologies follow are those of a third-party entity that manages them, not this one.
</p>
<p>
For queries regarding our collection and use of data for interest-based advertising purposes, please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4e212828272d2b0e2d212720342722222f602d212360">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.6	User Choices and Opting Out</strong>
</p>
<p>
Coinzilla's Users are provided with options that allow them to control how their Information is used by certain Services. Customers are able to control the interest-based content and ads they receive through several options:
</p>
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li>
<strong>The display of interest-based ads from Coinzilla can be disabled by clicking on the opt-out button below.</strong> It should be noted that you will still be able to see Coinzilla's content recommendations even if the opt-out function is enabled. Opting out prevents Coinzilla from using your Information to generate recommendations based on your particular interests. The recommendations you will receive from now on will be based on the specific website you are visiting (i.e., contextually based ads).
<p class="text-danger">
You can opt-out using our form at <a href="opt-out/">Coinzilla opt-out page</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Not Opted Out</strong>: You will receive personalized recommendations from Coinzilla based on your browsing history.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Opted Out</strong>: Your activity will no longer be tracked by Coinzilla, and, therefore, you will not be receiving personalized content recommendations derived from your past online activities
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li>
As we individually track device or browser operations, you will need to opt-out on each device and browser, individually, in order to completely opt out across multiple devices.
</li>
<li>
Your opt-out may not come into effect if your browser is set to reject cookies, as we have already recognized your opt-out configuration based on an opt-out cookie that we've sent to you. For the opt-out to be effective in this scenario, you will be required to confirm that your browser has the proper configuration. Users that have a Safari browser on iOS11 or macOS High Sierra first have to change their Privacy and Security Settings in order to disable "Prevent Cross-Site Tracking" and "Block All Cookies", and then access, once again, this privacy policy or their opt-out platform of choice to reset the opt-out settings.
</li>
<li>
Technologies that do not use cookies may be used by Coinzilla in very few specific situations. These technologies work in a similar manner to cookies, as they help us to create tailored ad recommendations based on your interests and keep track if the opt-out function was enabled. Please keep in mind that you may not be able to restrict the use of non-cookie technologies with certain web browsers, but you can go to the "User Choices" section on this page and click on the Opt-Out feature to have this function enabled.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Users can also disable getting targeted ads from Coinzilla and other advertising companies.</strong>
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li>
The <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" rel="nofollow">NAI opt out tool</a> stops Coinzilla and other NAI-approved member companies from sending you targeted ads. The NAI offers a guideline on how to opt out from mobile devices that run on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone operating systems.
</li>
<li>
The Digital Advertising Alliance affiliate websites also feature more information regarding User Choices and how to disable targeted advertising for each of the member companies.
</li>
<li>
The DAA consumer choice page is available to United States-based Users at <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices" rel="nofollow">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>
</li>
<li>
The DAAC consumer choice page is available to Canadian Users at <a href="https://www.youradchoices.ca/choices" rel="nofollow">www.youradchoices.ca/choices</a>
</li>
<li>
The EDAA consumer choice page is available to European Users at <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu" rel="nofollow">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You will still be able to see the advertisements from the companies featured in the DAA, DAAC, or EDAA consumer choice pages, even if you have activated the opt-out function. Opting out prevents these companies from using your Information to create ad recommendations based on your particular interests. The recommendations you will receive from now on will be based on the specific website you are visiting (i.e., contextually based ads).
</p>
<p>
Your opt-out may not be effective if your browser has been set to reject opt-out cookies when visiting DAA, DAAC or EDAA consumer choice pages (these cookies notice companies if your opt-out preference is enabled).
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.7	How We Keep User information</strong>
</p>
<p>
For ad-related purposes, User Information may be held for eighteen (18) months since the User's last interacted with our Services, after which we will de-identify the information by removing unique identifiers or aggregating the data.
</p>
<p>
The resulting de-identified or aggregated data may also be held by us to be used for reporting and analysis, during the entire period it is of commercial necessity. This type of data cannot be used for the identification of an individual or device. Opt-out data may be retained for longer than eighteen (18) months in order to track and keep active the opt-outs that have been requested.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.8	Children</strong>
</p>
<p>
Our data collecting and advertising is not knowingly targeted towards websites that have, as their audience, children under the age of thirteen (13). Parents or legal guardians of children under the age of thirteen (13) are able to contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5d323b3b343e381d3e323433273431313c733e3230">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> regarding our data collection methods.
</p>
<p id="site-visitors">
<strong>3. Site Visitors</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.1. Site Visitor Data Collection</strong>
</p>
<p>
Site Visitor Information may be collected by Coinzilla either from you or from third parties that collect data when using one of our Sites. We may combine all the data we obtain from different sources.
</p>
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li>
<strong>Data Collected Directly from You.</strong> Site Visitor Information may be collected by Coinzilla directly from you, in cases such as when you send us an e-mail with an inquiry or a form on our Sites that confirms you want to receive marketing materials or e-mail newsletters.

<p>
Your Site Visitor Information may be used by us for the following purposes:
</p>
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li>
<strong>Service Provision.</strong> For the purpose of providing the Services of our Sites, as well as for management motives.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Content Personalization.</strong> For the purpose of offering personalized content and data to you when you visit our Sites, and to give you a tailored browsing experience.

<li>
<strong>Analytical Purposes.</strong> To have an ampler insight on how our Sites are accessed and used, at an aggregated and individualized level; to offer our response to any demands and preferences; and to analyze and research how our site is used.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3.3. How Site Visitor Information Is Disclosed</strong>
</p>
<p>
Site Visitor Information may be disclosed by Coinzilla to the following parties:
</p>
<ul class="list-privacy">
<li>
<strong>Coinzilla's Affiliates.</strong> Any of the existing or future Affiliates, parent companies, or sub-branches of Coinzilla may receive Site Visitor Information for the processing purposes detailed in this Privacy Policy.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Coinzilla's Service Providers.</strong> Third-party service providers, such as vendors, agents, contractors, or other entities that perform services for our platform (e.g., maintenance, data analysis, surveys, payment and credit card processing, data hosting, etc.) may receive Site Visitor Information from us.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3.4. Third-Party Online Advertising</strong>
</p>
<p>
We may collaborate with third parties that employ their proprietary cookies, web beacons, and other technologies which record Site Visitors' online activities, either on our Sites and/or other sites, so that we can provide personalized advertisements that are suited to your interests.
</p>
<p>
Advertisers and ad networks are some of the included third parties that may gather data upon your vising or interaction with their advertisements and may also collect Information on your web browsing activities either on our Sites or other different sites.
</p>
<p>
The ad placement of Coinzilla is based on the principle that they should be featured in places that are of interest and have the most relevancy to visitors. By enabling ad networks to place their own cookies when our Sites receive a visitor, we are able to place our ads organically.
</p>
<p>
Ad networks are able to identify past visitors of Coinzilla's Sites through the use of these cookies. The ad network will be able to deliver a Coinzilla advertisement on any of its new ad spaces on a third-party website to that same individual that visited the Coinzilla Sites, as its cookies recorded his activity and noted his interest in Coinzilla.
</p>
<p>
To find out more details regarding the collection of Site Visitor Information through third parties, please read our <a href="cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a>.
</p>
<p>
