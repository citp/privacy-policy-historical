CosDNA may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within CosDNA, in order to determine what CosDNA services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within CosDNA to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. 

Automatically Collected Information

Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by CosDNA. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the CosDNA website. 

Use of Cookies

The CosDNA website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize CosDNA pages, or register with CosDNA site or services, a cookie helps CosDNA to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, visit history, and so on. When you return to the same CosDNA website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the CosDNA features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept of decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the CosDNA services or websites you visit.

How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals

Some internet browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference (the "DNT Signal") to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret DNT Signals, nor a common definition of "tracking", we do not currently respond to DNT Signals on the CosDNA Websites. CosDNA engages in so-called online behavioral advertising on third-party sites (also sometimes called "retargeting" or “tracking”), through which information collected about the pages you visit on CosDNA is used to display ads for CosDNA products or services on third-party websites. This information may uniquely identify a browser but is not personally identifiable.

Online Behavioral Advertising

CosDNA may use third-party online advertising companies to provide you with CosDNA advertisements that may be relevant to your interests, as determined by your activity on CosDNA and non-CosDNA websites. This type of ad customization is known as "online behavioral” or “interest-based” advertising. These advertising companies may use cookies to understand your interests based on, for example, pages visited and browsing patterns on CosDNA and non-CosDNA websites. 

Opting Out of Online Behavioral Advertising

You may opt-out of receiving online behavioral advertisements from third-party advertising companies that CosDNA uses to serve these interest-based ads. Because CosDNA participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory program, we have adopted the use of the DAA’s Advertising Options Icon (AdChoices) on these ads for the purpose of allowing users the ability to opt-out of this form of tracking. You may click on the AdChoices icon to opt out of receiving behaviorally-targeted ads that are served to you based on your browsing behavior on CosDNA websites. Please note that opting out through the AdChoices icon will only affect ads served to you based on your behavior on CosDNA websites, and does not prevent you from receiving other CosDNA advertising. You may also opt out of receiving behaviorally-targeted ads directly at our website using this link: AdChoices. Opting out through the CosDNA website, as opposed to using the AdChoices icon, means the data about your behaviors on CosDNA websites won’t be used by third party advertising companies to serve you interest-based ads. 

The methods of both collecting data for the purpose of serving behaviorally-targeted ads and recording your opt-out are done at the individual computer browser level and are based on browser cookies. If you clear your cookies or use a different browser or computer, you will need to re-submit your preference to the specified third-party advertising companies. For more information about behavioral advertising, please visit http://www.aboutads.info.

Furthermore, we may allow third-parties, including Google, to serve you ads on CosDNA and to store cookies for future use. Although we do not provide such third-parties with information that can identify your personally, this use of cookies, including Google’s use of the DART cookie, still enables them and their partners to serve you ads based on your visits to CosDNA and/or other sites on the Internet. We do not control whether third-parties respond to "do not track" signals, but you may opt out of the use of advertising cookies, including the DART cookie, by [visiting](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads) the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.
