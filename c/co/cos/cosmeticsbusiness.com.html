                This policy will help you understand how your personal information
                will be treated. This policy may change from time to time so

            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Wilmington

                Association, the Directory &amp; Database Publishers' Association,
                the Audit Bureau of Circulations and BPA International. Where

                sites you have the further assurance of our commitment to the
                standards set by the relevant body.</font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please keep
                in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information
                online - for example on message boards, through email, or in
                chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others.
                In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible
                to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other
                parties in return. </font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ultimately,

          <br>
  If you have any requests concerning your personal information or any queries
  with regard to these practices, please contact our Data Protection Officer

                  identifiable information does Wilmington collect from me? </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilmington
                collects information in several ways from different parts of
                our network of web sites.</font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some personal
                information is gathered when you register for our web sites,
                publications or events. During registration, Wilmington asks
                for your name, email address, birth date, gender, address and
                post code and personal and professional interests and responsibilities.
                The more accurate the information you volunteer, the better we
                are able to customise your experience of our web sites. Once
                you register you are no longer anonymous to Wilmington - you
                are given a password and are able to take full advantage of our
                services (subject to payment for certain services).</font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition
                to registration we may ask you for personal information at other
                times, for example when you enter a competition or promotion
                run or sponsored by Wilmington and when you report a problem
                with one of our sites or services. If you contact Wilmington
                we may keep a record of that correspondence. Wilmington also
                occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research
                purposes. Whenever Wilmington collects personal information we
                try to include a link to this Privacy Policy on the page in question. </font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your responses
                help us to sell appropriate advertising space and so minimise
                the cost of our services to you - or even provide some of them
                at no charge at all. They also enable us to personalise services
                to our readers. </font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilmington
                uses cookies as a means of offering and providing customisable
                and personalised services. However, your browser has settings
                that will allow you to accept all cookies, be informed as cookies
                arrive or reject all cookies. The downside of rejecting all cookies
                is that we are then unable to match the site content we offer
                you to what we know about your preferences from your previous
                visits. </font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition,
                advertising networks that serve ads onto Wilmington sites may
                use their own cookies. </font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilmington
                collects IP addresses for system administration, for independent
                audit and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.
                By this we can see how our sites are being used, for example,
                what services and facilities are popular, and how long users
                spend on particular pages. This is data about our users' browsing
                actions and patterns and it does not identify anyone individually. </font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you telephone
                a Wilmington company, or someone who is dealing with calls on
                our behalf, we may record the conversation to ensure the security
                of any transaction discussed, to help us to review our quality
                of service and to assist in the training and development of the
                employees who take such calls.</font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>How does
                  Wilmington use my information? </i></font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilmington's
                primary goal in collecting personal information concerning subscribers
                is to provide them with a customised experience of our site.
                By knowing a little about you, Wilmington is able to deliver
                more relevant advertisements and content to you, and by demonstrating
                the quality of our users we are able to secure advertising funding
                which keeps down the costs to the users.</font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When delivering
                targeted advertisements, Wilmington acts merely as the middleman.
                Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of
                audience they want to reach (for example, design specialists,
                or pump buyers in process industries). We take the advertisement
                and display it to users meeting the relevant criteria.</font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you join
                one of our email newsletter services the emails you receive may
                include advertising material and links to advertisers' web sites.
                This does not mean that your details have been passed to the
                advertiser in question. Furthermore, at the end of each newsletter
                you will find either a hyperlink or a description of a route
                to have yourself removed from further editions of that newsletter.</font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilmington
                undertakes research on our users' demographics, interests and
                behaviour based on the information provided to us upon registration,
                during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys.
                We do this to better understand and serve you, the user. This
                research is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. Wilmington
                may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners.
                We will use our best endeavours to ensure, where reasonable,
                that our business partners and advertising customers have effective
                on-line privacy policies and are registered under the Data Protection
                Act (as all of our relevant businesses are). </font></p>

                on a Wilmington site and are asked for personal information,
                you may not be sharing that information with Wilmington alone.
                Some services are offered jointly with a partner company. In
                order to provide this co-branded service to you, it is necessary
                for us to share your personal information with those partner
                companies. </font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Promotions
                and competitions that run on Wilmington's sites may be sponsored

                by us and another company. Some or all data collected during
                a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. </font></p>

                you give such as your credit card number and contact information,
                is provided to the merchant concerned. This is to enable transactions
                to take place. You agree that Wilmington Group plc and its associated

            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From time to

                or special offers from selected third parties. If you opt-in

                agreements, Wilmington may match user information with third
                party data. Also, Wilmington companies may disclose aggregated
                user statistics (for example, 58% of users are executives in
                SME's) in order to describe our services to prospective partners,
