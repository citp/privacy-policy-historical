# privacy | HPCi

We are HPCi Media Limited (“HPCi”) and our main operational address is: Natraj – The Tanneries, 55 Bermondsey Street, London SE1 3XG. You may contact us by email on data@hpcimedia.com.

We are committed to protecting all personal information we hold in any form. We will comply with the latest Data Protection legislation in the UK but more than that it is our intention to ensure your data is only held for the purpose of providing services and products to you and in keeping with your wishes.

HPCi intend to process all personal data lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. We keep data either because you have consented to us holding your data or through contractual agreement whereby we need to hold you data to fulfil our obligations under that agreement. In many circumstances both conditions will apply. Where we are supplying a product or service to you, you should read this Privacy Policy in conjunction with our Terms and Conditions. A list of all our products and services can be found at www.hpcimedia.com.

This privacy policy explains the following: what information HPCi may collect about you; how we will use the information; how we will contact you; how you can amend or delete what we hold about you, with who we will share your data; your choices regarding the personal information you have provided to us; our use of cookies on our websites and how you can reject these cookies.

## What information will HPCi collect about me?

When you participate in, or receive any product or service, from HPCi, such as our print and or digital information products or attendance or participation in live events or receive other business services, we need to hold personal information about you. This can include, for example, your name, business email address, business postal address, business telephone or business mobile number. We may also ask your specific areas of business interest. We also hold a record of our transactions with you or your company and we will hold a record of important communications between us in relation to our products and services.

## How will HPCi use the information they collect about me?

HPCi will use your personal information for a number of purposes including the following: to deliver products or services; for administration purposes; to inform you of other relevant products and services that as far as HPCi determine match your industry and job function; to contact you about a submission you have made to the websites, including any content you provide; to personalise the way content is presented to you; to analyse and improve the services offered.

## When will HPCi contact me?

We will contact you to fulfil any service we have committed to deliver for you or where we think your data may be inaccurate. We may also occasionally invite you to participate in surveys about HPCi Media services (participation is always voluntary); and for marketing purposes where legislation permits this and you have not told us that you do not wish to be contacted. 

## Will HPCi Media share my personal information with anyone else?

We will only share your information with 3rd parties when it is necessary for the fulfilment of our services and in such cases will only share data essential to the task. We will never sell or provide any third party with your data for their commercial use. 

If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to our websites, or otherwise engage in any disruptive or abusive behaviour in relation to our products or our staff, we may use your personal information to stop such behaviour or if we believe your behaviour breaches any laws we may share your information with the relevant government authorities.

## Data retention and your wishes

We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the fulfilment of a relevant service, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with us. Where you wish to cancel a digital service you can use our unsubscribe links found on all our email based information products or for all services you may just email us at info@hpcimedia.com. In addition to your wishes, if we do not detect any activity from your account in terms of interacting with our staff or products then we will delete your record after a suitable grace period but not longer than after 12 months of inactivity. In all cases we will hold sufficient data about you to fulfil our administrative needs such as archived record keeping and statutory duties under the laws in England and Wales.

## Can I find out what personal information HPCi Media holds about me?

Under the Data Protection Act you have the right to request a copy of the personal information HPCi holds about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. We will require you to prove your identity with 2 pieces of approved photographic identification. We will use best efforts to supply, correct or delete personal information about you at your request. You should address any requests either to the postal or email address given at the beginning of this policy. 

For international users all personal data collected by HPCi Media will be processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Our websites, 3rd party links and cookies policy

When using our websites we use third party hyper-links. These may well be to the companies we write about or services you may wish to engage with such as social media. Once you leave our websites by using these links our responsibilities to you end and you do so at your own risk.

When browsing our websites cookies may be used by HPCi. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a “device”) browser from our website’s computer and is stored on your device’s hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.

Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the websites to your interests. Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the hpcimedia.com features. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

During the course of any visit to our websites, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.

Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. This can be achieved through personalisation of your web pages or analysing user activity to determine what is more popular and what is not.

##  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679

Generally this means you have allowed us to use your information for the purpose of receiving one or more of our products. We have also reviewed our processes for upholding your individual rights including “to be informed”, “right of access”, “rectification” and “erasure”. In short, this means we will tell you what information we hold, we will correct it if it is wrong and you may restrict its use or have it deleted.

We encourage all clients to review our T’s and C’s which are highlighted during transactions and can be found permanently in the footer of all our web sites along with this Privacy notice. We would also remind all clients that:

  1. All our digital publications carry an unsubscribe link

  3. We only ever send relevant marketing messages to clients but even so you can revoke the use of your data for this purpose at any time

  5. When we make a mistake we will rectify it within 5 working days of being informed
  6. If you become inactive your data will be archived then deleted from our systems after a suitable grace period but no longer than 12 months.
