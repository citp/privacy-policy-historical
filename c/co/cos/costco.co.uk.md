**Protection of Personal Information**

We have put into place security measures in an effort to protect personal information from loss, misuse or alteration while it is under our control. Personal information we collect is stored electronically and may be combined with other membership information. We use technical, contractual, administrative and physical measures in an effort to protect against unauthorised access.

**D. Sharing of Personal Information**

We do not sell, rent, share or disclose personal information to third parties without your prior consent, except in the limited circumstances described below:  
**  
Order Fulfillment  
**We may provide to a third party certain information that is necessary to fulfill an order you have placed with us. For example, if you pay by a debit card, your card number and sales transaction information are passed on to the card processor and/or issuer (including their service providers such as fraud verification services). However, we give vendors, suppliers, and others involved in the commerce distribution chain only the information needed to provide you the products or services you order, such as shipping and/or billing address, e-mail address, telephone number and product orders. Moreover, we require them to keep the information confidential and not to use it for other purposes. We are not responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them

 **Other Disclosures**  
In addition, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorised to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Costco Wholesale, our customers, our employees or the public. Information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition

**Use of Personal Information by Costco**

The personal information we collect is generally used to process your requests or transactions, provide you with high-quality service, tell you about opportunities we think will be of interest, and understand your needs so that we can serve you better.   
For example, we may use your telephone number, your e-mail or your postal address to : (1) alert you about product recalls or safety issues; or (2) communicate membership opportunities and programs. We also may use personal information we collect to provide you with promotional information, which is information we believe will add value to your membership, such as coupon savings booklets, promotions, or information about Member Services ("Promotional Information"). If you prefer not to receive Promotional Information from us, we make it easy for you to let us know. You can contact us at any time to decline Promotional Information (see Choice below).

**Collection of Personal Information**

We collect the personal information that you provide us, such as when you:  


  * sign up for or renew your Costco membership;
  * purchase products or services at our warehouse locations;
  * contact us for any reason, such as by replying to enquiries by mail or fax, by telephone through customer service or in person at one of our locations;



**What is Personal Information?**

Personal information is information that identifies an individual or is directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a customer's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, debit card number, or information about activities which can be directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases. Personal information also includes information such as your medical history. As a convenience to our members, we allow the primary cardholder to add his/her spouse or others to membership. In all circumstances, other than your choice to opt-out (see Choice below), reference in this policy statement to "you" or "your" also includes your spouse and the others added-on to your membership by you. Reference in this statement to "information you provide" includes information provided by you, your spouse or others added on.

Our definition of personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products you purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products purchased by others. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and services to customer desires.
