#### A. What is Personal Data?

Personal Data is information that identifies an individual or that can be reasonably associated with a specific person or entity, such as a name, contact information, telephone number, Internet (IP) address and information about an individual’s purchases and online shopping.

#### B. Collection of Personal Data

We collect the Personal Data that you provide us, such as when you: 

  * Register to use Costco.co.uk;
  * Consent to receive news about specials or other promotions on costco.co.uk;
  * Place an order or purchase products or services;
  * Contact us for any reason;
  * Sign up for or renew your Costco membership or online subscription;
  * Participate in a survey or promotion; or
  * Sign up for or participate in our various Services (see Services below).



We may automatically collect some information when you visit our website, such as your computer's IP address and operating system, the site from which you linked to us, your site activity, the time and date of your visit, and your purchases. This information may be collected through the use of "cookies" and web beacons (see Cookies below). We also receive information from third parties who help us correct our records, prevent fraud, and provide Services (see Services below) or special promotions or products. We may combine any of this information with the other Personal Data we maintain about you.

#### C. Use of Personal Data by Costco

The Personal Data we collect is generally used to process your requests or transactions, provide you with high-quality service, tell you about opportunities we think will be of interest and administer your account, including distribution of our own surveys and publications. For example, we may:

  * Process and deliver your order;
  * Alert you about product recalls or safety issues;
  * Send notifications (via email or SMS/text message) related to your purchases, such as purchase confirmations or delivery schedules;
  * If you consent to receive it, provide you with promotional information, such as coupons, offers and product recommendations ("Promotional Information"). You may contact us at any time to decline Promotional Information (see Choice below).



#### D. Sharing of Personal Data

We share information in these circumstances: 

  1. **Order Fulfilment**  
We may provide to a third party information necessary to fulfil an order you have placed with us. However, we give suppliers, and others involved in the distribution chain only the information needed to provide you the products or services you order, and we require them to keep the information confidential and not to use it for other purposes. We are not responsible for any information you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them.
  

  2. **Order Contractors**  
We may contract with others to perform services on our behalf. For example, we retain companies to process credit card payments, ship merchandise, manage our customer care centre, distribute emails, process rebates or analyse and correct or update our data. If any of these service providers need access to your Personal Data, we require them to use it only to perform the services for us. We also require that they maintain the confidentiality of the information and/or return the information to us when they no longer need it.
  

  3. **Primary Costco Account Holder**

If you are a Costco Member, each membership account has an individual primary account holder who is authorised to designate and remove add-on members and make other account management decisions. We may disclose Personal Data that relates to activities occurring under the account to the primary account holder.

Similarly each online subscription account has a primary Subscriber. We may disclose Personal Data that relates to activities occurring under the account to the Subscriber of record.

  

  4. **Services**

You may purchase products and services offered by us through third parties, such as financial, travel, insurance and other business and consumer services ("Services"). We may share your name, postal address, email address and membership or subscriber status, number and type ("Information") with these third parties so they may notify you of their offerings, to determine whether, or at what level, you qualify for the products, offerings or services, and to evaluate new and existing products, offerings or services. If you prefer that we do not share Information with these third parties, you can contact us at any time (see ‘Choice; Updating Your Account Data’ below).

If you purchase, apply for or request Services, information you provide will be shared directly with the third party offering the Services.

These third parties are required to use Personal Data we share only to provide the requested Services. We are not responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices and policies before disclosing information to them. Information you provide to third parties, may in turn be shared with us along with information about your use of the services. In some cases, these third parties may require as a condition of providing services to you that you authorise them to share information with us. If we terminate our relationship with a third party, information you provided to them may be returned to us, and we may provide that information to a new third party offering the same or similar services.

If you apply for an American Express Card through Costco Wholesale, Costco Wholesale will collect the application on behalf of American Express.




#### E. Cross-Border Transfers

In some cases Personal Data may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) in order to carry out processes, including but not limited to e-mail communications and customer call-centre services. Costco.co.uk ensures that Personal Data transferred outside the EEA is maintained with at least the same level of security and protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects that is required under the UK Data Protection Act of 1998. By submitting Personal Data to Costco.co.uk you consent to the transfer and storage of your personal data outside the EEA.

#### F. Other Uses and Disclosures

In addition, we may use or disclose Personal Data in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorised to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to protect you, to comply with legal process or authorities, to respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of the Costco Companies, our shoppers, Costco’s Members and Subscribers, our employees or the public. This includes disclosure of information to control or investigate fraud. Personal Data, may be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger or sale of company assets or acquisition.

#### G. Protection of Personal and Credit Card Information

We have physical, administrative and technical security measures in place to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse or alteration while it is under our control. When you enter Personal Data online, that information is encrypted prior to transmission using a security protocol called SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). We also use SSL to allow you to securely view your online account and registration information. Even if you establish an account with us, we do not retain your credit card information. A unique “token” is substituted for your credit card number. If you become a repeat customer, you may be asked to create a password that you will give us instead of your credit card number, providing an additional layer of security.

Online account information is accessible only by using a password. You must keep your password confidential. You are responsible for all uses of www.costco.co.uk by anyone using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused.

#### H. Choice; Updating Your Account Data

We will not send you promotional emails or SMS (text) messages unless you explicitly consent to receive them. If you wish to give or withdraw your consent or update your online account information, or if you have questions concerning our information practices, you may call our Customer Care Centre on Freehone 0800 0324 324, or access "My Account" if you are a registered user of costco.co.uk.

Your choice not to receive promotional materials means that we also will not share your information with our providers of Services.

If you have more than one email address, you will need to make separate privacy elections for each. If you receive emails from the online Photo Center or have separately opted to receive materials from one of our Services providers (see Services) you will need to change your privacy elections separately for these communications as well.

#### I. Cookies

Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer. They enable us to monitor online activity. When you first access the website, you will be asked if you consent to our use of cookies. If you do not consent, the web site will not load properly.

Like most web sites, we use cookies to log your IP address, identify your browser type, and log the date and time of your purchases and other activities. We use this information for system administration, troubleshooting, fraud investigation, communications from Costco (only) and optimising your shopping experience. For example, we may customise our home page for you, better display pages according to your browser type, and/or deliver customised product recommendations and email. Cookies are not spyware, and Costco does not collect multi- site data or, with the exception of Google Analytics, share information with others that we gather through cookies.

We share your IP address, but no other Personal Data, with Google Analytics in order to obtain data about how our website is accessed and used. If you do not wish your IP address to be tracked for this purpose, you may opt-out of Google Analytics by following the steps found at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.

Finally, we use web beacons to determine when and how many times a page has been viewed. Again, we use this information for our own marketing purposes.

If you would like help clearing cookies, please call our Customer Care Centre on Freephone **0800 0324 324**. If you clear cookies you will need to accept our cookie policy upon your next visit to our website.

#### J. Links to Other Sites

From our web site you can link to websites of third parties who we allow to offer goods, information and/or Services. If it is not clear from the context that you are being directed to a third party site, we endeavour to notify you that you are visiting a site where a different privacy policy applies. In general, any Personal Data you provide on the linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of websites to which we link. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with Personal Data.

#### K. Use of costco.co.uk Website by Minors

We encourage parents to take an active interest in their children's use of the Internet. We do not intend to collect information from minors. If you are under 18, you should not provide information on the costco.co.uk website.

#### M. Changes to this Statement

We may change this privacy statement at any time, but will alert you that changes have been made by indicating at the top of the privacy statement the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review our privacy statement to make sure you understand how your Personal Data will be used. If we make a material change to how we use Personal Data and the new uses are unrelated to uses we disclose in this statement, we will communicate the changes in advance.

## Payment Security

We have put into place technical, contractual, administrative and physical security measures in an effort to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse or alteration while it is under our control. Personal information we collect is stored electronically and may be combined with other information.

We also use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input during online transactions. SSL Certificate details can be found by clicking the padlock icon next to the URL. We may request proof of identity before we disclose Personal Information to you in conjunction with our security procedures.

In some cases, Personal Information may be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in order to carry out essential processes. Costco.co.uk ensures that at all times Personal Information transferred outside the EEA is maintained with at least the same level of security that is required in the UK.

#### D. LIMITATIONS ON USAGE, LICENCE AND WEBSITE ACCESS

This website may only be used to order goods and services for delivery to addresses in the UK. The use of this website is governed by the laws of England and Wales. The laws of your jurisdiction may be more or less strict than the laws that apply to this website. If you access this website from outside the UK you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction.

To register and shop with this website you must be eighteen years of age or over. Please refer to Section K for more information in relation to the use of this website by minors.

If you meet the above requirements, we grant you a limited licence to make personal use only of the website. Such grant does not include, without limitation: (a) any resale or commercial use of this website or any Site Materials (defined above); (b) modification, adaptation, translation, reverse engineering, de-compilation, disassembly or conversion into human readable form any of the Site Materials not intended to be so read, including use of or directly viewing the underlying HTML or other code from this website except as interpreted and displayed in a web browser; (c) copying, imitating, mirroring, reproducing, distributing, publishing, downloading, displaying, performing, posting or transmitting any Site Materials (including any trade marks) in any form or by any means, including, but not limited to, electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording or otherwise; (d) the collection and use of any product listings or descriptions; (e) making modifications to or other derivative uses of the website and any Site Materials; or (f) use of any data mining, bots, spiders, automated tools or similar data gathering and extraction methods, directly or indirectly, on the Site Materials or to collect any information from the website or any other user of the website.

We reserve the right to enforce our legal rights.

#### E. CONTRACT PRICING, FORMATION, PAYMENT AND NON-MEMBER SURCHARGE

Prices indicated on the website include UK mainland delivery charges (unless stated otherwise). However, prices on the website do not include the annual subscription fee or the surcharge that must be paid by customers other than Costco Subscribers and Members when ordering goods or services from us. The surcharge is equal to 5% (five percent) of the total price of the goods and services placed in an order, excluding any VAT charged in respect of those goods and services. Subscription fees and surcharges are subject to VAT, which must be paid in addition. Costco Members whose membership is current and valid at the date of their orders, and who have entered their membership number during the registration process in the My Account section of the website, do not have to pay the surcharge. Subscription fees and surcharges will be separately itemized in the checkout section on the website and added to the price of the goods and services.

Nothing in these Site Terms or elsewhere on this website constitutes an offer to sell or supply goods or services, including a subscription to costco.co.uk. Your order of goods or services or application for a subscription account constitutes an offer to purchase them. Our Order Confirmation confirms the receipt of your order, but does not constitute an acceptance of it.

Except in the case of Higher Value Goods, we accept your order when we despatch the goods or begin to supply the services that you have ordered. This concludes the contract of sale for the goods despatched, but not for any other goods or services that you may have ordered at the same time.

In the case of Higher Value Goods, the contract between Costco and you for the sale/purchase of the goods concerned will not take place until the goods are made available for your inspection at the delivery address you have specified, and you have signed a receipt provided by the carrier. If you choose not to sign the receipt, we will retain the goods in question and your offer to purchase them will be deemed withdrawn.

Title to goods that you order will not pass to you until we have received payment in full for the goods concerned and the goods are delivered to you. We reserve our rights to retain the goods, or recover them from you, at any time until you have paid in full. The risk of loss of or damage to goods that you order will pass to you at the same time as title passes.

We shall be under no liability for any delay or failure to deliver goods or services ordered via this website if the delay or failure is caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control.

We welcome Visa, MasterCard, Maestro and American Express credit cards. When you order goods from us, you will need to complete your credit or debit card details. We will usually pre-authorize charges for up to ten days prior to shipment, but we will not take payment until shipment. In the case of Higher Value Items, payment may be taken at or about the time that the sale/purchase contract is concluded (as indicated above). 

All card payments are subject to authorisation by your card issuer. If your payment is not authorised, or for any other reason we are not able to take payment when we attempt to do so, we will not fulfil your order. We reserve the right to refuse a subscription to any applicant, and we may revoke a subscription at any time with or without cause.

#### F. PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS AND AVAILABILITY, PRICE INDICATIONS AND OFFERS AND CHANGES

We take reasonable precautions to ensure that goods and services are fairly and accurately described on our website and that they are available at the prices listed. However, please note that, subject to applicable law, we: (a) reserve the right to change the goods and services advertised or offered for sale through this website without any prior notice, the prices or specifications of such goods and services, and any promotional offers and any other Site Materials at any time and from time to time without any notice or liability to you or any other person; (b) cannot guarantee that goods or services advertised or offered for sale on this website will be available when ordered or thereafter; (c) reserve the right to limit quantities sold or made available for sale; (d) do not warrant that the Site Materials (including but without limitation to product descriptions, photographs and product user guides) are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free; and (e) reserve the right not to process orders, and to revise orders or recover funds where the price or other material information on this website is inaccurate or when we recognise there has been a material error or breach of the Site Terms. If we do not process an order for such reason, we will advise you that the order has been cancelled and will either not charge you or will apply credit to the payment type used in the order.

For more information please see our [Returns, Cancellations and Assistance Procedures](https://web.archive.org/faqs).

#### G. PASSWORDS AND SECURITY

If you use a password to access this website or any portion of it, then you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and for restricting access to your computer. If you use a shared computer, remember to sign-out once you finish shopping at costco.co.uk.

We reserve the right to take any and all action as necessary or reasonable to maintain the security of the website and your account, including but without limitation to: terminating your account, changing your password or requesting information to authorise or cancel transactions on your account.

While we take prudent steps to protect your account and the website, we cannot protect your information outside of the website. For example, if we communicate with you electronically but outside of the website, you acknowledge that the communication may not be transmitted and/or stored securely, and may be viewed by others. You acknowledge that by requesting information by e-mail, we may transmit it to you and store it in an unencrypted form.

In no event will we be held liable to you for any liabilities or damages resulting from or arising out of (i) any action or inaction of costco.co.uk under this provision; (ii) any compromise of the confidentiality of your account or password, and (iii) any unauthorised access to your account or use of your password.

## Statutory Cancellation Rights 

#### What is my statutory cancellation right as a consumer?

Under the UK's Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 (the "Regulations") you have the right to cancel orders for goods and services made through the website. This right ("statutory cancellation right") applies only where you make your purchase as a Consumer. You can only use this right within a period of 7 working days. The period of 7 working days begins on the day after the day on which you receive the goods relating to your order or (in the case of services) the day after the day on which the contract is concluded.

Please note that the statutory cancellation right only applies to contracts concluded exclusively by means of distance communication such as by email or telephone. It does not apply to other contracts. In particular, it will not apply if we specify special contract arrangements for the sale of Higher Value Goods, where you are given the opportunity for direct physical inspection of the items at the delivery address before the contract is concluded.

#### Are there any exceptions to the statutory cancellation right?

The statutory cancellation right also does not apply to certain types of goods namely:

  * goods that have been personalised or otherwise made to your specifications;
  * goods such as flowers, food, plants or other goods which by their nature are liable to deteriorate rapidly or cannot be returned (such as pierced jewellery), underwear or swimming costumes where the hygiene strips have been removed);
  * audio or video recordings or computer software that has been unsealed;
  * newspapers, periodicals or magazines; or
  * goods where the price is dependent on fluctuations in the financial market.



The statutory cancellation right does not apply to certain kinds of services, or to any kind of service where (by agreement) performance has begun before the end of the cancellation period.

#### What are my obligations?

Costco requires customers using the statutory cancellation right to return the goods to Costco in the event of cancellation. Costco also requires customers using the statutory cancellation right to pay the cost of returning them, or the cost incurred by Costco in recovering them.

#### How do I exercise my statutory cancellation right?

If you wish to exercise your statutory cancellation right please contact our Customer Care Centre at freephone **0800 0324 324** or by email, fax or hand/postal delivery to the addresses [here]. Please state that you "wish to cancel under the Distance Selling Regulations".

#### How do I return goods for any cancelled order?

Customers using the statutory cancellation right are required to:

(i) return the goods to us (in their original packaging, wherever possible) as soon as possible after informing us that they wish to cancel their order, and in the manner we direct; and

(ii) take reasonable care of the goods and not use them prior to their return.

Costco will instruct you how to make the delivery. We will ordinarily arrange for our carrier to collect them from you but we may alternatively ask you to send them to us using labels that we will provide. You will be responsible for the carriage costs you incur or (if we collect the goods) the direct costs of such collection (of which we shall inform you of at the time). We may deduct the direct costs of recovering the goods from the amount that we reimburse you for the goods in question.

Please note that this is not a full statement of your statutory cancellation right. For further information, please consult [www.adviceguide.org.uk](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/).
