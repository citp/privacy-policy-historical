We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how and for what purposes we use the information collected about you. By using our website, or entering into an agreement with us (eg. to list a property or advertise on our website) you are taken to have read, and agree to the collection, use, disclosure and handling of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

In collecting and handling personal information, we are bound by the Organic Law 15/1999, of 13 December, of Personal Protection Character Law and Royal Decree 1720/2007, and any other applicable privacy laws in Spain, together with the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WHY?**

**Information you give to us**

In order to provide the website to you, answer your enquiries, deal with your requests, customise and enrich your experience on our website and improve the services we offer you, we collect the info you provide us with when using it:

  * **Enquiries to our members:  **if you choose to fill in a form on the website or if you report a problem with any of our sites, you may be asked to provide information about yourself, such as name and contact details. We may also collect other info at the same time, such as details of the sort of property you are interested in, its location and price. Submitting an enquiry regarding a property or contacting an estate agent through our website will result in the information being passed to that estate agent. What they do with your information will be their responsibility. You will need to see the estate agent’s Privacy Policy to find out how they handle your personal information. We are not responsible for the way estate agents collect, use, disclose or handle personal information.


  * **Registered members:  **information provided at the time of registering to use our website, subscribing to our services, posting material, requesting further services or applying for credit.

**Information we collect about you**

As part of our efforts to keep our website safe and secure, ensure that its content is presented in the most effective manner for you and your device and for internal operations including troubleshooting and data analysis, we may collect technical data, such as:

  * Details of your visits to our website including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data and the resources that you access.



**Properties advertised on site**

In the course of providing our services and to enable our members to advertise their properties to the largest audience available and potential purchasers or tenants to see detailed descriptions and images of properties, we collect property data such as:

  * Property images and descriptions, asking price, property location and address and sales history. Our members or other third parties on behalf of them provide this data.



**For how long do we keep your information?**

Information that you provide us with when registering as a costadelhome.com user, along with enquiry data and or personal data collected by us, will be kept for two years from the date of collection, at which point it will be erased or anonymised so that it no longer identifies you.

A property will cease being advertised when we are instructed to do so by our members. However, property information will remain available on our website users to benefit from services such as identifying previous for sale or sold prices.

Data provided to us by phone, e-mail or otherwise will be retained for the later of 18 months from the date of communication or until your query is resolved.

**WHO DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION TO?**

We retain access to the personal data we have collected from or about you, yet we may disclose it in the following scenarios:

  * Once your information has been passed to one of our members in the course of providing our services (most typically when you communicate with an estate agent through our website) then that costadelhome.com member will have a copy of the information that you have provided within your enquiry and your contact details which they will use to get in touch with you. Our members (or any third party that acts on their behalf) will be responsible for information in their possession and that information will be subject to any privacy terms or policies that the member has in place; we are not responsible for use (or misuse) of your information by any of our members.
  * We may also have links to other websites from ours. We are not responsible for the content, security, privacy policies and practices of any other websites, even if you access them using links from this website.

  * If we offer or supply a service to you that is provided on our behalf by a third party we may have to pass your information to them in order to deliver the service. We may also use third parties to provide services on our behalf, which may include processing (but not using themselves) your information. In either case, we will not pass your information to anyone who is not also subject to adequate privacy commitments in our contract with them.
