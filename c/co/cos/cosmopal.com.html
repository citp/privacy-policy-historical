<td valign="top" class="mainText">In order to operate the CosmoPal service and to reduce the risk of fraud, CosmoPal Corp. ("CosmoPal" or "we") must ask you to provide us information about yourself and your credit card and/or bank account. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect and how we use that information. CosmoPal takes the privacy of your personal information very seriously and will use your information only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information or a list of our customers to third parties. However, as described in more detail in Part C below, there are limited circumstances in which some of your information will be shared with third parties, under strict restrictions, so it is important for you to review this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to all services that are hosted on the CosmoPal.com Web site, whether the services are offered by CosmoPal, by its subsidiaries, or by the CosmoPal Money Market Fund.        <br><br>Your privacy is important to us. By participating in the Council of Better Business Bureau's OnLine Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the program's strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have it verified by BBBOnLine.

<td valign="top" class="mainText">
<span class="emphasis">Required Information</span><br>To open a CosmoPal account, you must provide your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. In order to make payments through CosmoPal, you must provide credit card, debit card or bank account information (bank account information is required to make payments totaling more than $1,000). We also ask you to choose two different security questions to answer (such as your city of birth or your pet's name) This required information is necessary for us to process transactions, issue a new password if you forget or lose your password, protect you against credit card fraud and checking account fraud, and to contact you should the need arise in administering your account.          <br><br>If you enroll in the optional sweep of your funds into the CosmoPal Money Market Fund, we are required to collect your Social Security Number ("SSN") or other Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN"). In order to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, we will also require your SSN or TIN if you send or receive certain high-value transactions or high overall payment volumes through CosmoPal. If you choose to register or apply for certain optional features or products offered through CosmoPal Web sites, such as listing your business in CosmoPal Shops, or applying for the CosmoPal Visa © credit card or the CosmoPal MasterCard debit card, you will be required to provide additional information to establish that you qualify for such features or products.        <br><br><span class="emphasis">Supplemental Information</span><br>Effective May 2004, CosmoPal will require U.S. Premier and Business users who receive more than $2,000.00 USD  a month in payment volume through CosmoPal over three consecutive months to provide supplemental information about their businesses including business categorization, sales venue, and business URL information.         <br><br><span class="emphasis">Transaction Information</span><br>When you use CosmoPal to send money to someone else or request money from someone else, we ask you to provide information related to each transaction, including the amount of the transaction, the type of transaction (purchase of goods, purchase of services, or simple money transfer ("quasi-cash")) and the e-mail address of the third party. We retain this information for each of your transactions through CosmoPal. We also collect the Internet address (IP address) of the computer or device you use to access your CosmoPal account, in order to help detect possible instances of unauthorized transactions.          <br><br><span class="emphasis">Information About You From Third Parties</span><br>In order to protect all our customers against potential fraud, we verify with third parties the information you provide. In the course of such verification, we receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you register a credit card or debit card with CosmoPal, we will use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to CosmoPal, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.          <br><br>If you register your online business with CosmoPal Shops or if you send or receive high overall payment volumes through CosmoPal, in some circumstances we will conduct a background check on your business by obtaining information about you and your business from a credit bureau or a business information service such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet. If you incur a debt to CosmoPal, we will generally conduct a credit check on you by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, to the extent permitted by law. CosmoPal, at its sole discretion, also reserves the right periodically to retrieve and review a business and / or consumer credit report for any account, and reserves the right to close an account based on information obtained during this credit review process.         <br><br><span class="emphasis">Additional Verification</span><br>If we cannot verify the information that you provide, or if you request a withdrawal by check to an address other than your verified credit card billing address, we ask you to send us additional information by fax (such as your drivers' license, credit card statement, and/or a recent utility bill or other information linking you to the applicable address), or to answer additional questions online to help verify your information.          <br><br><span class="emphasis">Web Site Traffic Information</span><br>Because of the way that World Wide Web communication standards work, when you arrive at or leave the CosmoPal Web site, we automatically receive the Web address of the site that you came from or are going to. We also collect information on which pages of our Web site you visit while you are on the CosmoPal site, the type of browser you use and the times you access our Web site. We use this information only to try to understand our customers' preferences better and to manage the load on our servers, so as to improve our service and your experience with CosmoPal. We do not track the Web sites that you visit before or after you leave the CosmoPal site.          <br><br><span class="emphasis">Our Use of "Cookies"</span><br>"Cookies" are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us to recognize you as a CosmoPal customer if you return to the CosmoPal site using the same computer and browser. We send a "session cookie" to your computer if and when you log in to your CosmoPal account by entering your e-mail address and password. These cookies allow us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same session, so that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times. Once you log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect.          <br><br>We also use longer-lasting cookies to display your e-mail address on our sign-in form, so that you don't have to retype the e-mail address each time when you log in to your CosmoPal account. In addition, we use cookies to process our referral program, described in Section C below. Our cookie files are encoded so that your e-mail address and other information can only be interpreted by CosmoPal. We may, however, share cookie information regarding whether or not a certain user is already registered with CosmoPal with certain merchants with whom we have an official co-marketing relationship.          <br><br><span class="emphasis">Customer Service Correspondence</span><br>If you send us correspondence, including e-mails and faxes, we retain such information in the records of your account. We will also retain customer service correspondence and other correspondence from CosmoPal to you. We retain these records in order to measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate potential fraud and violations of our User Agreement. We may, over time, delete these records if permitted by law.          <br><br><span class="emphasis">Questionnaires, Surveys and Profile Data</span><br>From time to time, we offer optional questionnaires and surveys to our users for such purposes as collecting demographic information or assessing users' interests and needs. The use of the information collected will be explained in detail in the survey itself. If we collect personally identifiable information from our users in these questionnaires and surveys, the users will be given notice of how the information will be used prior to their participation in the survey or questionnaire.          <br><br><span class="emphasis">Non-member Recipients and Requests</span><br>When a member either sends a payment to, or requests a payment from, an individual who is not a registered member of CosmoPal, we will retain the information that the member submits to us, including, for example, the other party's email address and/or name, for the benefit of the member who is attempting to contact the non-member, so that the member can see a complete record of his or her transactions, including uncompleted transactions. Although this information is stored indefinitely, we will not market to the non-member in any way at any time. Additionally, these non-members have the same rights to access and correct information about themselves (assuming that their email addresses were correct enough to reach them) as anyone else who uses CosmoPal.    </td>

However, your credit card number, bank account and other financial information will NEVER be revealed to anyone whom you have paid or who has paid you through CosmoPal, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process.         <br><br>If you are buying goods or services and paying through CosmoPal, the seller of the goods or services may request that you provide a mailing address that CosmoPal has confirmed as matching the billing address in the credit card system.

                                of CosmoPal Visa © credit cards, so that Providian

                                investigations of violations of our User Agreement. 
                                Specifically, this means that if we conduct a

                                has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give

                                When a user signs up for a co-branded version 
                                of CosmoPal through Intuit's QuickBooks software, 
                                CosmoPal will share with Intuit information on 
                                that user's CosmoPal transactions so that the 
                                information can be automatically entered by Intuit 
                                into the user's QuickBooks program. If a user 
                                does not want his or her information shared with 
                                CosmoPal's co-branded partner, he or she should 
                                not use this aspect of the site. </p>

                                CosmoPal Asset Management, Inc., a wholly-owned 
                                subsidiary of CosmoPal that is the transfer agent 
                                for the Money Market Fund, so that you can complete 
                                your investment more easily and can move funds 
                                into and out of the Money Market Fund without 
                                re-entering your personal information for every

                                We disclose information to your agent or legal

                                e-mail to provide requested services, and we also

                                or investigate suspicious transactions. We use 
                                your e-mail address to confirm your opening of 
                                a CosmoPal account, to send you notice of payments 
                                that you send or receive through CosmoPal (including 
                                referral payments described below), to send information

                                When you sign up for a CosmoPal account, you become

                                identifies you as the referrer. If a merchant

                                or first and last name (if you have a Premier 
                                account) may be listed in the referrer's CosmoPal 
                                account, along with the amount of bonus you have 
                                generated for the referrer, which is calculated 
                                as a percentage of your transaction volume, as 
                                described in the <a href="#">Merchant Referral
