### Your Personal and Payment Information is Safe

Whenever you provide any personal or payment information (e.g., when making a purchase), we use SSL technology to make sure that it is "encrypted" (all scrambled up) so that no one else can read it while it is being transmitted over the Internet, and all information is safely stored behind our firewall.

All Credit Card information is stored in our database in an encrypted format, behind a secured, hacker-proof firewall. For your security, the complete credit card number will never be made available to view. Encrypted Credit Card information is stored for the sole purpose of expediting the checkout process for future purchases. We may also collect IP address, domain types (e.g. .com or .org, etc.), your browser type, the country, state and the pages of our site and the length of time of your visit during your visit.

### How Information is Used

We use customer information we collect only for the purposes of filling orders, contacting purchasers to inform them of their order status, sending promotional information, enhancing the operation of our site, statistical purposes and to administer our systems.

**Please note, we do send out periodic notifications regarding promotional offers via email.**
