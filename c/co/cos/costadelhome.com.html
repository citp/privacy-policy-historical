<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong>Cookies</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Cookies are data that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies, which are industry standard and are used by most websites, including our websites, can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site. All pages on our website are coded with measurement software which is transparent to the user. The software makes use of an invisible image at the bottom of the web page. This software stores a "cookie" in the browser, which contains a unique string. This information is collected and aggregated, and in no way does this unique identifier identify a user personally. Cookies allow us to:
</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
		count the number of unique browsers to the web site;
	</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
		customize the web site to your needs; and
	</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
		to serve targeted advertising
	</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	When you visit costadelhome.com (including this website, mobile site and other websites with the costadelhome.com header and/or footer), and the sites of our advertising partners (which may include third party websites), we may place one or more cookies on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time you visit these sites and/or are displayed advertising. These cookies allow us to collect certain information about your web browsing behavior in order to select what advertisements to display to you and to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements. We use the information collected from your web browsing behavior to make assumptions about your characteristics and the things you are interested in, and then display targeted advertising that we believe may be of interest to you. For example, we may select the advertisements we display based on certain interest categories that we have inferred based on:
</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
		your online activity on costadelhome.com site and our advertising partners’ websites, including pages you view and links you click;
	</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
		the search terms you enter using search engines and services, including on costadelhome.com; and
	</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
		demographic or interest data, for example information that you have provided when creating an online account with us or one of our advertising partner websites (e.g. age, post code, gender).
	</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	We also allow other ad serving networks to display advertisements the costadelhome.com site. In these instances code in our web pages direct our ad serving platform to call the advertisement from one of our ad serving networks. The companies in this network may also participate in behavioral advertising. We do not marry any information collected via cookies with any of your personal information for the purposes of behavioral advertising. The cookies used by us for behavioral advertising have an expiry date of no more than 2 years.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on costadelhome.com. Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to costadelhome.com and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy at the following URL: http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong>Cookie Choices</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature. However, you should note that some cookies are necessary to provide you with essential features of our online services and therefore may not be disabled without disabling the entire services.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong>Links to Other Sites</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	We provide links to websites outside of our website, as well as to third party websites. These linked sites are not under our control, and we cannot accept responsibility for the conduct of companies linked to our websites. Before disclosing your personal information on any other website, we advise you to examine the terms and conditions of using that website and its privacy statement.
