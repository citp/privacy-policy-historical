**2.** **Purpose of the Processing**

THE COMPANY will process information provided by the USER for different purposes, depending on the way the data were gathered:

  * To provide the services requested by the USER.
  * To process, manage, provide, expand, and improve the services the USER has decided to subscribe to or register for.

  * To manage the contractual and business relationship between THE COMPANY and USER as required.
  * To send information regarding changes in products or services purchased by the USER.
  * To send information regarding new or similar services to those originally purchased.



The USER consents to the processing of their data as per the outlined purposes, without prejudice to their right to confirm or revoke said consent by ticking the corresponding box available on each form.

As per the above-mentioned purposes, your data will be processed with your consent during the timeframe indicated on each form or until you state your desire to cancel such consent or refuse the data processing. In the cases where a business relationship exists between THE COMPANY and the USER, your data will be saved during the duration of the business relationship and as required afterwards to fulfil legal responsibilities.

The user is thus informed and unequivocally and expressly consents to their personal data being processed by THE COMPANY via online tools for sending electronic notifications provided by companies such as SalesForce, located in the United States of America and adhering to the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, providing adequate guarantees for the processing of your personal data. These tools gather information through pixels (tiny transparent electronic images linked to your address), that allows us to know who is accessing our campaign and at what time. The USER can stop this use in their email management system settings in order to stop the automatic download of images.

**3.** **Recipients of Information**

We inform that your information will not be sent to third-parties, except when:

  * The transfer is authorised by a law.
  * One of the companies making up the COSENTINO GROUP ([forms.cosentino.com/cosentino-group-subsidiaries/](http://forms.cosentino.com/cosentino-group-subsidiaries/)) is the recipient of such transfer, which is required to develop our business relationship with you or because you have requested a particular product or service, in response to a legitimate interest, or for corporate purposes. Some companies from the COSENTINO GROUP may be located in third-party countries, including countries where local legislation does not require an adequate security level similar to that set out by the Data Protection Agency of Spain.
  * The data processing is in response to the free and legitimate acceptance of a legal relationship whose development, fulfilment, and control thus imply a connection between said data processing and third-party files, such as: stores where you are to pick-up samples or where you’ve requested an appointment; banks, for the billing of purchased products and services; or delivery companies for sending purchased products.
  * Data may be requested by the Ombudsman, Public Prosecution Authority, Judges, Courts, or Spanish Court of Audit in the exercise of their respective functions.
