# Privacy Policy | Cosmos

Cosmos Media Pty Ltd (referred to as "Cosmos" or "We" hereafter") recognises the importance of your privacy and we are committed to protecting your personal information.

This privacy policy covers all personal information that we hold.

**SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?**

When you purchase something from Cosmos, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address. We also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.

We will not combine information collected from your browser or device with personal information you have submitted without your prior consent. We only use this information for statistical and internal purposes including improving the functionality of Cosmos' websites or mobile apps for our users.

Only authorised and audited Cosmos staff can view your personal information once we receive it.  


From time to time, Cosmos will invite you to participate in surveys. These surveys are designed to ensure that our products and services remain as relevant to you as possible. Cosmos will always advise if the survey is anonymous or if your participation will be linked to you in any way.

Subscribers may choose to be removed from Cosmos email lists at any time by changing communication preferences in their account settings.

Cosmos will use personal information provided to it for our primary purposes and secondary purposes. By agreeing to this policy, you consent to Cosmos using your personal information for the following:

 _ **Primary purposes**_

  * Providing you with products and services you have ordered, or contacting you in relation to these orders
  * Answering direct enquiries
  * Informing you of new products which may be of interest to you
  * Providing customer service
  * Complying with legal obligations where necessary
  * Allowing us to run our business and perform administrative and operational tasks, such as:  
training staff;  
developing and marketing products and services;  
risk management;  
systems development and testing, including our websites and other online channels;  
undertaking planning, research and statistical analysis;



 _ **Secondary purposes**_

  * Billing and account management
  * Improving our products, services and websites
  * Improving our marketing and promotional efforts
  * Improving the accuracy of the personal information we hold



We may also use your personal information to get a better understanding of your needs. Unless you tell us otherwise, we may use this information to bring you products and services which we believe will benefit you. Upon receiving new products and services for the first time, you will be given the option to opt-in immediately to receive future offerings of the item in question.  


 **SECTION 2 - CONSENT**  


**How do you get my consent?**

When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.

If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.

If this privacy policy changes in future in response to changes in legislation, you may be asked to re-consent to your personal details being held.

**How do I withdraw my consent?**

If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us by one of the methods listed at the end of this Privacy Policy.

Cosmos takes reasonable precautions to ensure that the personal information we collect and use is complete, relevant and up-to-date. However, the accuracy of the personal information we receive depends to a large extent on the information you provide. We recommend you let us know if there are any errors in your personal information by contacting Cosmos.  


**SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE**

Personal information will not be used for any other purpose without the consent of its provider unless Cosmos is required by law to disclose that information, or if you violate our terms of service. Cosmos may be required to disclose personal information to third parties in order to provide a service that you requested.

Other than in circumstances such as these, Cosmos will not disclose personal information provided, such as name, address, email address or telephone number, to any organisation or person outside Cosmos unless the provider has clearly and directly authorised Cosmos to do so.  


**SECTION 4 - PAYMENT**

Payment is completed using Stripe, then Chargebee stores your credit card data and Xero stores transaction records. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction.

All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.

PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information.

 **SECTION 5 - EMAIL DELIVERY**

Our newsletters are administered through Mailchimp - this means some of your information is stored on a Mailchimp server. This includes your email address, IP address and certain information about the links you click within the emails we send you. Mailchimp will never share your personal information with any other party, unless they are legally compelled to do so, and will only contact you if you initiate contact with them first. Only authorised Mailchimp employees have access to our subscriber list.  


**SECTION 6 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES**

In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.

However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.

For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers. Their respective privacy policies are listed below:

  * [Stripe privacy policy](https://stripe.com/au/privacy)
  * [Chargebee privacy policy](https://www.chargebee.com/privacy/)
  * [Xero privacy policy](https://www.xero.com/au/about/terms/privacy/)
  * [Mailchimp privacy policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/)



In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.

As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.

Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.

If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption.
