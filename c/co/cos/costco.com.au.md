# Privacy Policy | Costco

_This privacy statement (also referred to as Costco's Privacy Policy) explains our privacy practices for our members who: (1) shop in our Australian or international warehouses or (2) use our Australian Web site,[www.costco.com.au.](https://web.archive.org/) Costco may include Costco's affiliate companies. _

## Costco's Commitment to Privacy

We respect your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This privacy statement explains our policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information. The terms of this privacy statement apply to information collected from you, unless different terms are specified as part of a special offer, or in another form or contract we provide you and you consent to those terms by participating in the special offer or the program, or otherwise. The paragraphs below provide detailed information about our privacy practices:

## What is Personal Information?

Personal information is information or an opinion that identifies an individual or is directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a customer's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, debit card number, or information about activities which can be directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases. Personal information also includes information such as your medical history.

As a convenience to our members we allow the primary cardholder to nominate his/her spouse or others to membership.

In all circumstances, other than your choice to opt out (see Choice below), reference in this policy statement to "you" or "your" also includes your spouse and the others added onto your membership by you. Reference in this statement to "information you provide" includes information provided by you, your spouse or others added on.

Our definition of personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products you purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products purchased by others. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and services to customer desires.

## Collection of Personal Information

We collect the personal information that you provide us, such as when you:

  * sign up for or renew your Costco membership;
  * purchase products or services at our warehouse locations;
  * contact us for any reason, such as by replying to enquiries by mail or fax, by telephone through customer service or in person at one of our locations;



## Use of Personal Information by Costco

The personal information we collect is generally used to process your requests or transactions at any Costco, in Australia or abroad, provide you with high-quality service, tell you about opportunities we think will be of interest (including by direct marketing), and understand your needs so that we can serve you better.

For example, we may use your telephone number, your e-mail or your postal address to : (1) alert you about product recalls or safety issues; or (2) communicate membership opportunities and programs. We also may use personal information we collect to provide you with promotional information, which is information we believe will add value to your membership, such as coupon savings booklets, promotions, or information about Member Services ("Promotional Information"). If you prefer not to receive Promotional Information from us, we make it easy for you to let us know. You can contact us at any time to decline Promotional Information (see Choice below).

## Sharing of Personal Information

We do not sell, rent, share or disclose personal information to third parties without your prior consent, except in the limited circumstances described below:

## Order Fulfilment

We may provide to a third party certain information that is necessary to fulfil an order you have placed with us. For example, if you pay by a debit card, your card number and sales transaction information are passed on to the card processor and/or issuer (including their service providers such as fraud verification services). However, we give vendors, suppliers, and others involved in the commerce distribution chain only the information needed to provide you the products or services you order, such as shipping and/or billing address, e-mail address, telephone number and product orders. Moreover, we require them to keep the information confidential and not to use it for other purposes. We are not responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them

## Other Disclosures

In addition, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorised to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Costco Wholesale, our customers, our employees or the public. Information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition

## Protection of Personal Information

We have put into place security measures in an effort to protect personal information from loss, misuse or alteration. Personal information we collect is stored electronically and in hard copy form and may be combined with other membership information. We use technical, contractual, administrative and physical measures in an effort to protect against unauthorised access. This information may be stored in a jurisdiction outside Australia and/or shared with service providers and other Costco companies. Any company, including other Costco companies, must use the information only for the purpose for which we share it, and we endeavour to make sure that any recipient of your information also has adequate measures in place to protect your information against unauthorised access.

## Choice

We give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving certain information or to request that certain information not be shared with third parties by giving you numerous methods to inform us of your decision. Your choice to opt-out will not apply to your spouse or any other individual, including other family members.

If you do not want to receive Promotional Information (see Use of Personal Information by Costco) or information about Member Services, you can: (a) visit us at our Membership desk at any Costco warehouse location; (b) call us at 02-9469-7999; (c) e-mail us at [membership@costco.com.au](mailto:membership@costco.com.au) or (d) write us at Costco Wholesale Australia Pty Ltd, Australian Home Office, 17-21 Parramatta Road, Lidcombe NSW 2141.
