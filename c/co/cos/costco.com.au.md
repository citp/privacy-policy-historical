# Terms and Conditions | Costco Australia

## Costco Wholesale Corporation Privacy Statement – Australia

This privacy statement (also referred to as Costco's Privacy Policy) explains our privacy practices for our members who: (1) shop in our Australian or international warehouses or (2) use our Australian Web site, www.costco.com.au. Costco may include Costco's affiliate companies.

### Costco's Commitment to Privacy

We respect your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This privacy statement explains our policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information. The terms of this privacy statement apply to information collected from you unless different terms are specified as part of a special offer or in another form or contract we provide you and you consent to those terms by participating in the special offer or the program or otherwise. The paragraphs below provide detailed information about our privacy practices.

### What is Personal Information?

Personal information is information or an opinion that identifies an individual or is directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a customer's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, debit card number or information about activities which can be directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases. Personal information also includes information such as your medical history.

As a convenience to our members we allow the primary cardholder to nominate his/her spouse or others to membership.

In all circumstances, other than your choice to opt-out (see Choice below) reference in this policy statement to "you" or "your" also includes your spouse and the others added onto your membership by you. Reference in this statement to "information you provide" includes information provided by you, your spouse or others added on.

Our definition of personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service. No personal information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products you purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products purchased by others. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better consider new products and services and tailor existing products and services to customer desires.

### Collection Of Personal Information

We collect the personal information that you provide us, such as when you.

  * Sign up for or renew your Costco membership.

### Use of Personal Information by Costco

The personal information we collect is generally used to process your requests or transactions at any Costco in Australia or abroad. Provide you with high-quality service, tell you about opportunities we think will be of interest (including by direct marketing) and understand your needs so that we can serve you better.

For example we may use your telephone number, your e-mail or your postal address to (1) alert you about product recalls or safety issues or (2) communicate membership opportunities and programs. We also may use personal information we collect to provide you with promotional information, which is information we believe will add value to your membership. Such as coupon savings booklets, promotions or information about Member Services ("Promotional Information"). If you prefer not to receive Promotional Information from us, we make it easy for you to let us know. You can contact us at any time to decline Promotional Information (see Choice below).

If you pay by a debit card, your card number and sales transaction information are passed on to the card processor and/or issuer (including their service providers such as fraud verification services). However we give vendors, suppliers and others involved in the commerce distribution chain only the information needed to provide you the products or services you order. Such as shipping and/or billing address, e-mail address, telephone number and product orders. Moreover, we require them to keep the information confidential and not to use it for other purposes. We are not responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these parties and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them
