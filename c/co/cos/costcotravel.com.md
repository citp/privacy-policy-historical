The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device, but it can contain other information as well. 

We use cookies on our websites to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze how our products perform, and fulfill other legitimate purposes.

Our websites may include web beacons and cookies from third-party service providers. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content, or ads delivered by other ad networks (see Advertising, Services Provided by Others; Interest-Based Advertising below).

  * • Adobe Analytics
