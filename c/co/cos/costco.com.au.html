	<h1 id="PrivacyTitle">
		Costco Wholesale Corporation<br>
		Privacy Statement</h1>
	<h2 id="PrivacySubTitle">
		(Australia)<br>
	</h2>
	<p>
		This privacy statement (also referred to as Costco's Privacy Policy) explains our
		privacy practices for our members who: (1) shop in our Australian or international warehouses or
		(2) use our Australian Web site, <b>www.costco.com.au</b>. Costco may include Costco's affiliate
		companies.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Costco's Commitment to Privacy
	</h2>
	<p>
		We respect your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the
		uses of your information is important to us. This privacy statement explains our
		policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information.
		The terms of this privacy statement apply to information collected from you, unless
		different terms are specified as part of a special offer, or in another form or
		contract we provide you and you consent to those terms by participating in the special
		offer or the program, or otherwise. The paragraphs below provide detailed information
		about our privacy practices:
	</p>
	<h2>
		What is Personal Information?
	</h2>
	<p>
		Personal information is information or an opinion that identifies an individual
		or is directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a customer's
		name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, debit card number, or information
		about activities which can be directly linked to that person, such as his or her
		purchases. Personal information also includes information such as your medical history.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a convenience to our members we allow the primary cardholder to nominate his/her
		spouse or others to membership.
	</p>
	<p>
		In all circumstances, other than your choice to opt out (see Choice below), reference
		in this policy statement to "you" or "your" also includes your spouse and the others
		added onto your membership by you. Reference in this statement to "information you
		provide" includes information provided by you, your spouse or others added on.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our definition of personal information does not include "aggregate" information.
		Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products,
		services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed.
		In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined
		with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information
		will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products
		you purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products purchased
		by others. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs so that
		we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and
		services to customer desires.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Collection of Personal Information
	</h2>
	<p>
		We collect the personal information that you provide us, such as when you:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>sign up for or renew your Costco membership; </li>
		<li>purchase products or services at our warehouse locations; </li>
		<li>contact us for any reason, such as by replying to enquiries by mail or fax, by telephone
			through customer service or in person at one of our locations; </li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Use of Personal Information by Costco
	</h2>
	<p>
		The personal information we collect is generally used to process your requests or
		transactions at any Costco, in Australia or abroad, provide you with high-quality
		service, tell you about opportunities we think will be of interest (including by
		direct marketing), and understand your needs so that we can serve you better.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, we may use your telephone number, your e-mail or your postal address
		to : (1) alert you about product recalls or safety issues; or (2) communicate membership
		opportunities and programs. We also may use personal information we collect to provide
		you with promotional information, which is information we believe will add value
		to your membership, such as coupon savings booklets, promotions, or information
		about Member Services ("Promotional Information"). If you prefer not to receive
		Promotional Information from us, we make it easy for you to let us know. You can
		contact us at any time to decline Promotional Information (see Choice below).
	</p>
	<h2>
		Sharing of Personal Information
	</h2>
	<p>
		We do not sell, rent, share or disclose personal information to third parties without
		your prior consent, except in the limited circumstances described below:
	</p>
	<h3>
		Order Fulfilment
	</h3>
	<p>
		We may provide to a third party certain information that is necessary to fulfil
		an order you have placed with us. For example, if you pay by a debit card, your
		card number and sales transaction information are passed on to the card processor
		and/or issuer (including their service providers such as fraud verification services).
		However, we give vendors, suppliers, and others involved in the commerce distribution
		chain only the information needed to provide you the products or services you order,
		such as shipping and/or billing address, e-mail address, telephone number and product
		orders. Moreover, we require them to keep the information confidential and not to
		use it for other purposes. We are not responsible for any additional information
		you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with
		their practices before disclosing information directly to them
	</p>
	<h3>
		Other Disclosures
	</h3>
	<p>
		In addition, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that
		we are lawfully authorised to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to
		comply with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the
		rights, property or personal safety of Costco Wholesale, our customers, our employees
		or the public. Information about our customers, including personal information,
		may be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger,
		sale of company assets or acquisition
	</p>
	<h2>
		Protection of Personal Information
	</h2>
	<p>
		We have put into place security measures in an effort to protect personal information from loss, misuse or alteration. Personal information we collect is stored electronically and in hard copy form and may be combined with other membership information. We use technical, contractual, administrative and physical measures in an effort to protect against unauthorised access. This information may be stored in a jurisdiction outside Australia and/or shared with service providers and other Costco companies.  Any company, including other Costco companies, must use the information only for the purpose for which we share it, and we endeavour to make sure that any recipient of your information also has adequate measures in place to protect your information against unauthorised access.  
	</p>
	<h2>
		Choice
	</h2>
	<p>
		We give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving certain information or to request
		that certain information not be shared with third parties by giving you numerous
		methods to inform us of your decision. Your choice to opt-out will not apply to
		your spouse or any other individual, including other family members.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you do not want to receive Promotional Information (see Use of Personal Information
		by Costco) or information about Member Services, you can: (a) visit us at our Membership
		desk at any Costco warehouse location; (b) call us at 02-94697999; (c) e-mail us

		also have the option of utilising the unsubscribe facility.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please note, even if you opt-out of communication with Costco, Costco reserves the right 
		to use your contact details, including your e-mail address to alert you about product recalls 
		or safety issues.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the case of telemarketing calls, you should familiarise yourself with any rights
		which you may have under the <i>Do Not Call Register Act 2006 (Cth)</i>.

		Changes to this Statement
	</h2>
	<p>
		We reserve the right to change this privacy statement at any time, but will alert
		you that changes have been made by indicating at the top of the privacy statement
		the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review our privacy statement to
