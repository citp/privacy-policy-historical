# Privacy Policy | Cosca.org

The owners and operators of Cosca.org take your online privacy seriously. This document outlines the types of information collected by our servers and provides links to the privacy policies of our third-party advertising partners.

**Server Logs**  
Like most web sites, Cosca.org logs web-, database-, and other server-software usage and access information. This information may include your internet protocal (IP) address, which in many cases can be translated to an affiliation (such as your work, school, or internet service provider), or a geographical location. We only use this information for debugging purposes and for aggregating into anonymous usage and traffic statistics.

**Cookies**  
While browsing Cosca.org, a small number of text files referred to as "cookies" may be created on your local file system by your web browser at the request of our servers. These files allow us to personalize the browsing experience for both registered and non-registered users. You are free to delete them at any time, or configure your browser not to create them. However, we do not promise that every feature of Cosca.org will function as expected without cookies enabled.

**Third-Party Advertisers**  
In order to cover the costs of providing Cosca.org as a free resource to the public, we have relationships with many third-party advertising networks. The practices of our advertising partners are not directly covered by Cosca.org's privacy policy. We recommend that you read their policies. For your convenience we provide a list our advertising partners below. Unfortunately we cannot guarantee it is always comprehensive and up to date.
