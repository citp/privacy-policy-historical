#### 5.  Data Sharing

Costa is part of the Coca-Cola group of companies. Coca-Cola group companies may process your personal data in the course of assisting us with customer information services, for instance SA Coca-Cola Services NV operates the Costa 'Ready To Drink' product customer care line and will handle enquiries and concerns regarding that product as its manufacturer. Details of such enquiries and concerns will be shared with Costa if there is a specific complaint relating to Costa that Coca Cola is unable to handle.

For some activities Costa uses third party service providers, for instance O2 provide WiFi in our stores. When these service providers need customer data from you, we share information with them, such as whether a correct Costa Coffee Club member number has been entered to access WiFi, or our online order fulfilment partner needs information such as your name, contact details, address, and the items you have purchased to manage any complaints, comments or queries you submit to us regarding your online purchase.

In addition to using the companies as described above, we use third party providers for the following services:

  * WiFi (O2)

  * Sending promotional offers

  * Customer feedback surveys

  * Online order fulfilment, including the management of queries, concerns or complaints related to your order(s)

  * Data analysis to enable us to optimise our services (including locations and products) Gift cards (including E-Gifts)

  * Loyalty scheme platform

  * Insurance

  * IT development, support, maintenance and hosting, including the provision of applications and website hosting

  * Payments’ processing to enable you to pay by credit or debit card

  * CCTV system provision and maintenance

  * Administration of our competitions and awards, for example our work with the Booksellers Association and panel judges on the Costa Book Awards.




If our business is to be integrated with another business or sold, your details would be shared with our advisers and any prospective purchaser’s advisers. Your information could be passed to the new owners. (You will be notified if this happens).

Personal data may be shared with government authorities and/or law enforcement officials for the prevention or detection of crime, if required by law or if required for a legal or contractual claim.

#### 6. International transfers

Sometimes we send or store your data outside of the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway) (‘EEA’). For example, to follow your instructions, comply with a legal duty or to work with or receive services from our service providers who we use to help run your accounts and our services.

If we do transfer information outside of the EEA, we will make sure that it is protected by using one of these safeguards:

  * Transfer it to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the EEA. Some countries have been deemed adequate by the EU.

  * Put in place a contract with the recipient that means they must protect it to the same standards as the EEA or use other mechanisms and measures to achieve adequate protection. We also may use the Standard Contractual Clauses published by the EU.

  * Transfer it to organisations that are part of Privacy Shield. This is a framework that sets privacy standards for data sent between the US and EU countries. It makes sure those standards are similar to what is used within the EEA.

  * Binding corporate rules. These are internal rules adopted by group companies to allow international transfers of personal data to entities within the same corporate group located in countries which do not provide an adequate level of protection.




For our service provider in the US, who helps us with our customer feedback surveys, we rely on Privacy Shield. For our service provider in India, who has restricted access to some data to provide us with IT support and maintenance services, we rely on contractual measures. For further details on the mechanisms used please contact [costadataprotectionofficer@costacoffee.com](mailto:costadataprotectionofficer@costacoffee.com).

#### 7\. Cookies and similar technologies

We always look to keep your data for the minimum time in line with data protection principles and our processes. For example, we keep: 

  * Information on Costa Coffee Club members as follows. If you register but do not collect and/or use any points using your card or app within 12 months, your registration points will expire and we will delete your Costa Coffee Club account information at that point. If you do not collect and/or use points for 2 years, we will delete your Costa Coffee Club account information.

  * Records of payment information in line with tax law and audit requirements. 

  * Customer feedback and correspondence with our customer services teams for up to 4 years afterwards, depending on the nature of the interaction and any applicable law, such as health and safety. This enables us to respond to any questions or complaints. 

  * Information to maintain records according to rules that apply to us. 




If you unsubscribe from marketing communications we keep a record of this request indefinitely to ensure we do not send you direct marketing again. 

We may keep your data for longer if we cannot delete it for legal, regulatory or technical reasons.

Some rights, however, may be limited. We may be obliged by law or regulation to keep information.
