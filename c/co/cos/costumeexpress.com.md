### How do I remove my name from your mailing list?

Follow the instructions below to remove yourself from any of our mailing lists:

  * ##### Our Email lists

On our [email preference page](https://web.archive.org/profile/emailsubscription), enter in your email and select the "I do not wish to receive any e-mails from CostumeExpress.com" option.

  * ##### All mailing lists

Visit [DMAChoice Direct Marketing Association](http://www.dmachoice.org/), at [www.dmachoice.org](http://www.dmachoice.org/). The Direct Marketing Association is the leading trade association for business and non-profit organizations that send direct mail. Their site helps you manage the amount of mail you receive. You can request to stop receiving mail not only from individual companies but from whole categories of mailers including Credit Offers, Catalogs, Magazine Offers, and Other Mail Offers. This is a great site to take control of the amount of mail you receive but it could take up to three months for your removal request to process so you still may receive emails and/or catalogs until that time.
