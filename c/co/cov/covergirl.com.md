The success of our business depends on your trust, and we do not sell your personal information to marketers outside of P&G. We share your personal information within P&G and as described in this Policy. We do not share personal information with marketers outside of P&G unless you consent to such sharing, or as described within this Policy. 

**Co-promotions with Carefully Selected Business Partners**  
P&G may collect personal and other information for a co-promotion or joint program with a business partner and share your information with that business partner. For these programs we will make clear at the point of collection that the information will be shared with P&G and the participating business partner and ask for your consent as required by applicable laws. 

**Third-party service providers**  
We rely on third-party service providers to perform a variety of business operations on our behalf. In so doing, we may need to share your personal information with them. We provide our service providers with only the personal information they need to perform the services we request, and we require that they protect this information and not use it for any other purpose. 

For example, we may rely on a service provider to: 

  * Fulfill your product and service requests and answer your questions.
  * Host our sites and deliver our email or other communications.
  * Mail product samples, contact contest winners, manage payments or take other actions on our behalf.
  * Analyze our data, sometimes combined with data from other sources, to send you communications.
  * Conduct research and analyze data to improve our products, services and sites.
  * Where permitted by law, combine personal information about you that P&G has collected with personal information about you that a business partner has collected so we can jointly send tailored promotional communications to you. In such instances, our business partner will not be permitted to use P&G data or the combined data for its own, independent marketing purposes. Our service provider will only be allowed to use the combined set of information to send you joint communications that we hope will be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive these joint communications, you can always opt out by following the instructions provided in any such communication or through this Privacy Policy as indicated above.
  * Perform other services that we request.

  * Mobile applications you use.
  * The P&G brand emails you view and links you click in the email.

Some newer mobile device operating systems allow you to limit the use of information to deliver interest-based advertising in mobile applications. You can check the settings on your device for such options in your devices’s operating system.
