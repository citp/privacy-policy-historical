**Coverawards.com** Mark Allen & Company LLC/Tecktonik Media/coverawards.com and all their affiliates (collectively referred to in this Privacy Statement as “we” or “coverawards.com”) recognize the importance of protecting the information provided by users of our website.  Coverawards.com has implemented this Privacy Policy to govern the use of personally identifiable information that we collect from this Site (“Personal Information”).

**Overview**

This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with information as to: (i) the type of information that is collected, (ii) how the collected information is used and with whom it is shared; (iii) how we intend to protect the information; and (iv) how you can have such information modified and/or removed.

**California Privacy Rights**

Under California law, California residents who have provided personally identifiable information to a company may have the right to request a list of all third parties to whom that company had disclosed such information for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, along with a list of the categories of personal information that had been so disclosed. However, if a company adopts and discloses a privacy policy that provides the ability to opt-out of such disclosures to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, then the company is not required to maintain and provide such lists, and instead may provide you with information on how to exercise your right to prevent disclosure of your personally identifiable information.  Because coverawards.com’s policy as disclosed on this Site provides you with an opportunity to opt-out of disclosures by coverawards.com of your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, coverawards.com does not have to provide you with such lists. **** If you are a California resident who would like information on how to exercise your rights concerning third party disclosures, you may send an email to:
