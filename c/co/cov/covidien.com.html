            <p>Covidien plc, and its affiliates (“Covidien”) - Privacy Policy, Last Updated: April 15, 2010. As a user of this Internet Website (“Site”), you ("you" or "user") are valued by Covidien. Covidien is committed to protecting the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") provided by and collected from you on this Site in connection with the functions, facilities and services offered on this Site.</p>

              <h2>
                <span>What Personal Information Does Covidien Collect From Site Users?</span>
              </h2>
              <p>We may gather Personal Information so that we can improve and personalize your experience with Covidien. Personal Information that we collect falls into the following primary categories. We may receive Personal Information that you enter into the Site, provide in an online form, or provide in any other way. You can choose not to provide some or all of the Personal Information we ask for, but this may prevent you from using some of our Site's features, such as on-line educational course credit. </p>
              <p>In addition to the preceding categories of Personal Information, Covidien also collects certain non-identifiable information (the "Non-Identifiable Information"). Whenever you interact with Covidien, we receive and store certain types of Non-Identifiable Information. For example, we may use "cookies" to obtain information when your web browser accesses this Site. A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier which we transfer to your computer via your Web browser and store on your computer's hard drive. The cookie file allows us to recognize your computer when you visit our Site. On most web browsers you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie, and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they may enable you to take advantage of some of our Site's best features.</p>

                <span>How Do We Use Your Personal Information And Other Non-Identifiable Information?</span>
              </h2>
              <p>Covidien uses the Personal Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Information for a certain reason, we may use it in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we may use the Personal Information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. If you contact us about a job listing, we may use your Personal Information to consider you for the position. Covidien also uses your Personal Information and other Non-Identifiable Information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our customers and markets, and to improve our products and services. Covidien may also use your Personal Information to contact you, electronically or otherwise, in the future to tell you about products or services we believe will be of interest to you or to make it easier for you to use our site.
