<strong>BINDING CONTRACT</strong>
<br><br>

CoveritLive is a service provided by Demand Media, Inc. This Privacy Policy incorporates theTerms of Service ("TOS") and, unless otherwise noted, incorporate the defined terms used in the TOS. If you are not comfortable with this Privacy Policy or our TOS, please do not register or use the Site, or provide us with any personally identifiable information ("PII") or any other information or content.
<br><br>
<strong>1. What information may be collected by CoveritLive, and how is it collected?</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Type of Information We Collect.</strong> We collect any information you enter on the Site or give us
in any other way such as by signing-up for an Account. You may make changes, corrections,
or updates to your Account information by visiting the "Account" section on the Site. We may
keep a record of all information that is changed (including deletions) and disclose it for any lawful
purpose. We may determine what may be changed (e.g., if we are required to keep track of
certain kinds of transactions, you may not change relevant information).
<br><br>
<strong>Information in Public Areas of the Site.</strong> Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily
provide information in public areas of the Site, such as during a Live Event, that information
can be viewed and possibly used by others. We therefore advise visitors not to disclose contact
information, including phone number, email address, street address or instant messenger address
(within these public areas) that they do not wish to share. We are not responsible for PII you
choose to submit in these public areas. Also, we may highlight content you post to the public areas
of the Site such as reviews or comments, such as by featuring your content on the Site’s home
page.
<br><br>
<strong>Minors.</strong> We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age
of 14 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 14, do not attempt to register
for our Site or send any information about yourself to us. We recommend that prospective users
between the ages of 14 and 17 ask their parents or other legal guardians for permission before
sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.
<br><br>
<strong>Cookies.</strong> Like many websites, we use "cookies." Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we
transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to
recognize your browser. We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember your information and
to link your activities to you. While you can take steps to warn off, block or disable cookies, if you
do, the Site may not function and appear as we have designed it. Nonetheless, if you want to take
these steps, you can do so by following the instructions associated with your browser. Our cookies
do not collect PII that you provide to us during the registration process, but they may collect
other information such as the following:
<br><br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc; padding-left: 15px;">
<li>the domain name and host from which you access the Internet and the Internet address of the
site from which you direct-linked to ours;</li><br>
<li>the date and time you access the Site and pages you visit;</li><br>
<li>our computer's IP address and information about its operating system, platform and the Web
browser type and version you use;</li><br>
<li>demographic and other non-personally identifiable profile information about you; and</li><br>
<li>information to combat fraud or misuse.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<strong>Pixel Tags.</strong> In our emails to you, we may use "pixel tags" to determine if your email software or
service can display html-formatted email (this helps us optimize the size of our email messages and
conserve bandwidth).
<br><br>
<strong>Collection of Information by Third Parties.</strong> Our Site may include third-party advertising, links
to other websites, and other content from third party businesses. The content posted by these
parties will be reasonably identifiable as coming from a third party. We do not provide any PII to
these advertisers, third-party websites, or other businesses, although on occasion we may mutually
share non-personally identifiable (e.g., demographic) information to facilitate delivery of relevant
advertisements. These third-party websites, businesses, and advertisers, or advertising companies
working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to deliver (or "serve") the advertisements that
appear on our Site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this
happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize
or optimize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other
technologies that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party
websites or businesses are not covered by this Policy but are covered by their respective privacy
policies. Some, but not all, third party advertising companies provide a mechanism to opt-out of
their technology. For more information and an identification of advertisers that provide an opt-
out mechanism, please click the following: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.
<br><br>
<strong>2. What Does CoveritLive Do With Collected Information?</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Use of PII.</strong> We may use your PII for purposes such as responding to your requests, monitoring
and providing the Site, maintaining your account, enforcing our rights and the rights of third
parties, and investigating and ensuring compliance with the Terms.
<br><br>
<strong>Opting-Out.</strong> Users can unsubscribe from any newsletters or opt out of various promotional e-mailings at any time by sending an e-mail to the same address, or by clicking on "unsubscribe"
links in each of our newsletters or emails. We reserve the right to send you customary business
communications such as acceptance/rejection notices regarding content submissions, general
system and administrative messages regarding the Site, address confirmations, and transactional
information about your account, and we may not offer you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
such communications so long as you are registered with the Site.
<br><br>
<strong>Use of Other Information.</strong> We use non-PII about our users for purposes such as measuring the
number of visitors to sections of our Site, making the Site more useful to visitors and delivering
targeted advertising and non-advertising content. We use IP addresses to analyze trends,
administer the Site, track a user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for
aggregate, non-personally identifiable use.
<br><br>
<strong>Retention of Information.</strong> We retain information for as long as required, allowed or we believe
it useful, but do not undertake retention obligations. We may dispose of information in our
discretion without notice, subject to applicable law that specifically requires the handling or
retention of information. You must keep your own, separate back-up records.
<br><br>
<strong>Generally.</strong> Subject to the terms of this Policy, we reserve the right to the following worldwide:
use, access (or bar access to), process, disclose, display, share, transfer, store, sell, retain,
commingle, investigate, verify, prove, and otherwise deal with, voluntarily or as required by law,
(collectively "Disclose") all PII, non-PII and other information. We may Disclose the foregoing
internally to third parties or through any databases for any purpose not prohibited by this Policy
or, in our discretion, to help prevent or address perceived harm, damage or loss to us or others
or to respond to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or other legal process. We reserve the
right to send you customary business communications (i.e. acceptance/rejection notices regarding
content submissions, general system and administrative messages, etc.) without offering you the
opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.
<br><br>
<strong>3. Does CoveritLive Share Information With Other Parties?</strong>
<br><br>
We share information with third parties, but only as described in this Section 3.
<br><br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc; padding-left: 15px;">
<li>Advertisers and Others. We share non-personally identifiable information with advertisers,
service providers, and other persons with whom we conduct business. Similarly, these advertisers,
service providers, and other persons may share with us non-PII about you that they have
independently gathered or acquired.</li><br>

<li>Third Party Services. We contract with affiliated and non-affiliated third parties to provide
services to us or to you on our behalf. Examples include providing marketing assistance, providing
customer service, sending emails to you, removing repetitive information from customer lists, and
analyzing data. These third parties may have access to your PII for use solely in connection with
these authorized business activities.</li><br>

<li>Business Transfer. As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets,
or engage in acquisitions, mergers, restructurings, changes of control, or similar transactions. In
such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets, and
your PII may be subject to such a transfer. Also, in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, customer
information may be transferred to a bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession and then to a
subsequent purchaser.</li><br>

<li>Affiliates. We may share PII, non-PII and other information with our corporate affiliates.
Some of our most significant affiliates are identified on the website of our parent company,
Demand Media, Inc. http://www.demandmedia.com. Corporate affiliates are those entities that
we control, are controlled by us, or are under common control with us and any joint venture
in which any of the controlled entities may participate from time to time. Any use of your
information by our corporate affiliates is subject to this Policy or another policy no less protective
of your privacy. Conversely, we may obtain information about you from our corporate affiliates
or from your visits to other websites that we or our corporate affiliates control.</li><br>

<li>Compliance and Safety. We may release user information when we believe release is
appropriate to:
<br><br>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle; padding-left: 15px;">
<li>comply with applicable law, and to respond to legal process, including subpoenas,
search warrants and court orders, and to respond to or otherwise address written
complaints of copyright infringement;</li><br>

<li>make disclosures under programs intended to prevent potential crimes or
investigate persons;</li><br>

<li>enforce or apply agreements, including the Terms; or</li><br>

<li>protect the rights, property, or safety of our Site, our users, or others, including
exchanging information with other companies for fraud protection and credit risk
reduction.</li></ul><br>
</li></ul>
<br>
<strong>4. How Secure Is My Information?</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Your Obligations.</strong> You must protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your
computer. Please sign off when finished using a shared computer. Your emails to us are not
necessarily secure against interception so do not include sensitive information in them. We
generally will not ask for passwords in an email and you should assume that if you get such a
request, it might be fraudulent. YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU REASONABLY CAN TO
ENSURE THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.
<br><br>
<strong>Our Security Measures.</strong> We take reasonable precautions to protect the security of our users'
information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent
unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However,
neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition,
people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore,
while we use reasonable efforts to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If
applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your PII, you agree that intentional
misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.
<br><br>
<strong>5. What About Links to Other Sites?</strong>
<br><br>
The Site contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such
other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy
statements of every web site that collects your personally identifiable information. This Policy
applies only to information collected by the Site.
<br><br>
<strong>6. What Does CoveritLive Do When This Privacy Policy Changes?</strong>
<br><br>
We reserve the right to change our Policy at any time. Non-material changes and clarifications
will take effect immediately. If we make non-material changes, we will indicate at the top of this
page the revised Policy's new effective date. If we make material changes, we will notify you by
email or through notice on the home page of the Site, and will also indicate so at the top of this
page. The material changes will take effect 30 days after such notice. We encourage you to refer
to this Policy at least every 30 days to check for material changes to this Policy.
<br><br>
<strong>7. What If I Have Other Questions Or Concerns About Privacy Or This Policy?</strong>
<br><br>
