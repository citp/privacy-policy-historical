#### 4\. COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES.

The Web Site may use “cookies”. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our Web Site people have visited and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies as Non-Personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered Personal Information by law, we also treat these identifiers as Personal Information. If you want to disable cookies, check with your web browser provider to find out how to do so. Please note that certain features of the Web Site may not be available once cookies are disabled. As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and “clickstream” data. We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the WebSite, to learn about user behavior on the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Coveo may use this information in its marketing and advertising services. In some of our email messages, we may use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Web Site. When you click one of these URLs, you pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on the Web Site. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in such a way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. 

#### 5\. SHARING INFORMATION

  1. **With Affiliates**. Coveo may share information about you with its affiliates in accordance with this Privacy Policy in order to work with them. For example, Coveo may need to share your Personal Information for customer relationship management purposes. We may also receive personal and non-personal information about individuals from our subsidiaries, business partners, resellers and other third-party sources. This information is mainly used to complete the information we already have about specific individuals, such as: updated business address information, purchase history and demographic information. 
  2. **With Business Partners**. From time to time, Coveo may partner with other companies to jointly offer products or services. If you purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly-offered product or service from Coveo, Coveo may share data about Coveo customers collected in connection with your purchase or expression of interest with our joint promotion partner(s). Coveo does not control its business partners’ use of your data, and their use of the information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may opt not to purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly offered product or services.

Where relevant, the Web Site uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption on all web pages where personal information may be collected from. It is highly recommended to use a TLS-enabled browser.

You may can request that we correct your data if it is inaccurate or that we delete it (if Coveo is not required to retain it by law). We may decline to process your request if such request is unreasonably repetitive; requires disproportionate technical efforts; jeopardizes the privacy of others; is impractical or for which access is not otherwise required by law.
