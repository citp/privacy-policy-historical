# Privacy and cookies policy | Coventry Building Society

As a customer of the Coventry Building Society, we take your right to privacy very seriously. We will not disclose information about you or your accounts to anyone, other than where we have your consent, or where we are compelled or allowed by law to do so.

For this reason, we believe you are entitled to know about the information we collect and what we plan to use it for. You can then decide if you are happy to provide us with this information.

If you decide to provide us with any information, then you expressly authorise us to use that information in accordance with this policy.

## Why we collect information about you?

We collect data about you:

  * to confirm your identity
  * to set up and then administer your accounts
  * to let you know about other relevant products and services
  * to update our customer records
  * to carry out statistical analysis to enable us to improve our products and services
  * for crime prevention and for legal and regulatory compliance
  * for computer system testing
  * for staff training purposes



In some instances, we will be unable to provide you with a product or service, if you do not provide us with the necessary information or give us your permission to process and store that information. 

## What do we do with your data?

Most of the information we hold is stored electronically on computer systems. However, some data, for example the details you handwrite on an application form are held as manual or paper copies. We are confident that our systems are secure, and that no one will be able to access your information unlawfully. 

We occasionally use external suppliers to process data on our behalf, for example to print names and addresses on letters for large mailing campaigns. We only use reputable companies and always ensure that they meet our stringent security requirements. On occasion, we may transfer data outside this country or the European Economic Area, either for storage or to be processed.

We may use the information we hold for staff training purposes and computer system testing. This is to ensure that we continue to deliver an efficient service to all our members.

From time to time we'll tell you about new accounts or services. You can choose not to receive this information when you open your account. You can change your instructions at any time, by writing to us with details of your savings and/or mortgage account number(s), to Mortgage and Investment Services, Coventry Building Society, PO Box 9, Coventry, CV1 5QN.

However, we will continue to send notice of General Meetings if you are eligible to vote, and where appropriate information about your account and interest rate changes.

## Who we share your data with

Apart from using outside companies as described above there are some specific instances when we will have to pass your details on to third parties or receive information about you from third parties.

### Confirming your identity

To meet our responsibilities for crime prevention and for legal and regulatory compliance, we need to confirm the identity of every applicant who applies for an account with the Society. Where possible we will try and do this electronically, using the services of a specialist external agency.

### Credit referencing

If you apply for a mortgage we will perform a search with a licensed credit reference agency. The agency will keep a record of our enquiry and if the mortgage proceeds we will provide them with details of how you conduct your account. Other lenders may access this record if you apply to them for credit. 

The credit reference agencies we normally use are:

  * Equifax PLC, Credit File Advice Centre, PO Box 1140, Bradford BD1 5US
  * Experian, Consumer Help Service, PO Box 8000, Nottingham NG1 5GX
  * Callcredit PLC, 1 Park Lane, Leeds LS3 1EP



If you would like to see the information that they hold about you, please contact them in writing, enclosing a cheque for £2.00 made payable to the agency. They will need details of your full name, address, postcode and any other addresses you have lived at over the past six years, in order to trace your record.

### Fraud prevention and detection

We share personal data with a number of other financial service providers through schemes such as CIFAS, National Hunter, the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register and a payment protection insurance anti-fraud register of claims. The main purpose of this is to protect us against any fraudulent or other criminal activity.

All financial institutions are required by Money Laundering legislation to collect and record personal data to confirm a customer's identity and to report any suspicious transactions to the Serious Organised Crime Agency.
