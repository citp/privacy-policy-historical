<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Cozi is strongly committed to the privacy of all its users. We understand you value your family's privacy and we do too. We want you to always be confident that your Cozi experience is safe and secure. If you have any additional privacy or security questions after reading this information, please <a href="mailto:privacy@cozi.com">contact us</a>. This Privacy Policy governs how we collect and use your information when you use our websites, mobile apps, and related services ("Services").</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What kind of information does Cozi collect from me?</strong></h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We collect and use the following information:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><em>Information you give us.</em> We collect the information you give to us when you are using our Services, including the first names and email addresses of family members, calendar appointments, shopping list items, and recipes. If you choose to send text messages to your family via Cozi, we will collect phone numbers from you for that purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><em>Usage Information.</em> We collect information from and about your use of the Services and the devices you use to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and information about the advertisements you view and the links you click on. Your devices (depending on your settings) may also transmit location information and/or an advertising identifier to the Services.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><em>Payment information.</em> If you provide us with any payment information related to the Services, e.g., if you upgrade to Cozi Gold from our website, we will ask for your credit card information, which will be processed directly by a Company Affiliate or a Vendor, as each are defined below. If you upgrade to Cozi Gold from an iOS or Android app, you will pay for the upgrade directly through Apple or Google, respectively, and we will not have access to your credit card information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What does Cozi do with my information?</strong></h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We use the information we collect to provide, personalize, improve, offer, and protect our Services. If you contact Cozi, we may use your information to provide customer support to you. We may use your email address to communicate with you, for example, to inform you when a subscription is ending.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Cozi is able to provide many of our Services free of charge because we are supported by advertising. In order to make these services available, we may use the information we collect to improve the advertisements you see by making them more relevant.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>With whom does Cozi share my information?</strong></h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">WE UNDERSTAND YOUR FAMILY'S INFORMATION IS VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU, AND WE TREAT IT CAREFULLY. We do not sell your personal information, and we do not share your personal information with third parties, except as described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><em>With vendors working for Cozi.</em> Cozi uses certain trusted third parties to help us provide, personalize, improve, offer and protect our Services ("Vendors"). Vendors will access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf, in compliance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><em>For Partner editions.</em> If you have specifically signed up to use a Partner Edition of our Service, Cozi may share your name and email address as well as non-personally identifiable, aggregate information with our partners. A Partner Edition is a version of our Services that we have specially developed with a trusted Cozi business partner. If you are using a Partner Edition, you will also see either (a) the following label: "Cozi · [Name of Partner] Edition" in the upper left corner of the software window or web browser when you are using the Cozi service or (b) a designation on the "Settings" page of your account. If you are unsure whether you have a Partner Edition, please contact us at www.cozi.com/support and we will be happy to let you know.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><em>With other parts of Time Inc.</em> Cozi is a subsidiary of Time Inc. and may share personally identifiable information with Time Inc. and other Time Inc. subsidiaries, such as Time Customer Service, Inc. (collectively, the "Company Affiliates"). Any information shared with Company Affiliates will be subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><em>For legal reasons.</em> We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with the law or in response to a law enforcement agency's request; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Cozi or our users; or (d) protect Cozi's property rights.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What about third party links?</strong></h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Cozi does not have control over the privacy policies of advertisers or other third-party websites. There are links to other websites and pages provided by third parties on Cozi. Similarly, advertisements typically link to third-party websites. An advertiser may receive the information you enter into a form or survey contained in an advertisement. Any personal information you enter is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Do you use Cookies?</strong></h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Cookies and other technologies.</em> We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your account for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. Cookies can also be used to target advertisements to you. To learn more about this practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, <a href="/personalized-ads">click here</a>. Cozi may not recognize the "do not track"&nbsp;signals that some browsers may employ. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Cozi uses Mixpanel for analytical purposes. To opt out of Mixpanel's cookie usage, please visit <a href="https://mixpanel.com/optout/" target="_blank">https://mixpanel.com/optout/</a>. Please note that if you get a new computer, install a new browser, erase or otherwise alter your browser's cookie file, you may also clear any opt-out cookies you have.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>How does Cozi protect children's information?</strong></h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Cozi takes protection of your family's personal information very seriously. Cozi will never knowingly request personally identifiable information or private content from anyone under the age of 13. In order to register and create a Cozi account you must be 18 years of age or older. You may, at any time, direct Cozi to delete all identifiable information regarding you or your family that you have provided or that has been collected from your family. To do so, please contact our Privacy Officer at the contact information below. However, if you do any of the foregoing, you and your family will not be able to use the Cozi account or our Services.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>How do I access or correct my information collected by Cozi?</strong></h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">As a Cozi user, you have the opportunity to review and modify your personally identifiable information and your private content any time you log onto your Cozi account using an email address and password listed on the account.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What if I live outside of the United States?</strong></h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Cozi's Services are hosted in the United States. If you are visiting our website from outside the United States, you are transferring your personal data into the United States when you use the Cozi service. Many regions, such as the European Union, have data collection protections that differ from U.S. law. If you are a European Union citizen, please see our <a href="/safe-harbor">Safe Harbor Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What if our business is sold?</strong></h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event of a merger with a third party or upon a sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party acquirer or another Time Inc. company. The new company would be required to protect all the information that Cozi has collected from its users under the same terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>How does Cozi maintain security?</strong></h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Cozi is strongly committed to protecting your information. Cozi uses industry standard methods of securing user information and data. Examples of our security measures include, where appropriate, firewalls and secure socket layers. We also maintain strict limits on who at Cozi can access the information databases that contain your information. Since there is no such thing as perfect security over the Internet, we cannot guarantee 100% security. However, in the unlikely case of a security breach on our databases, we will take immediate steps to resolve the problem swiftly and effectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What happens if I want to forward my Cozi information to a friend?</strong></h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If you use one of the Cozi features designed to allow you to voluntarily forward or share your information or content with family or friends outside of your secure account, we will forward or share access to such content from your account to your friend's email address as you provided it to us. Such email address may be stored by Cozi for your future use but will not be used by Cozi to initiate any emails. By sharing your content, you automatically limit Cozi's ability to keep your content private. We recommend that you do this only with trusted friends and family.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Will there be changes and updates to this Privacy Policy?</strong></h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time to stay informed of any updates or changes to this Privacy Policy. If you continue to use our Services after we make changes to the Privacy Policy, you agree to the changes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>How do I contact Cozi?</strong></h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="/support">www.cozi.com/support</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Postal Mail Address:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Your California Privacy Rights: Notice to California Residents</strong></h2>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers who are California residents and who have provided Cozi with "personal information" (as that term is defined in Section 1798.83) to request certain information about the disclosure of that information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident with questions regarding this, please contact us at <a href="/support">www.cozi.com/support</a> or by mail at the address listed above.</p>
