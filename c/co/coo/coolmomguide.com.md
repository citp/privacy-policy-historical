**Social login**

When you use social login:

•    If you sign into your social network account using the same email that you previously used to register for an account with us, you will access your existing account with us.

You may use social login or regular sign in each time you login into your account with us. If you use regular sign in but a password has not been issued to you (because you registered through social login) you need to get a password through the password reset flow.
