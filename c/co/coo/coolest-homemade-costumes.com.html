This document also outlines  some 
      of the steps we take to safeguard information. We hope this 
      will help you make an informed decision about sharing 
    personal information with us.</p>
    <p><em>Coolest Parties</em>  strives to maintain the highest 
      standards of decency, fairness and integrity in all our 
      operations. Likewise, we are dedicated to protecting our 
      customers', consumers' and online visitors' privacy on our 
      website.</p>
    <p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
    <p><em>Coolest Parties</em> collects personally identifiable 
      information from the visitors to our website only on a 
      voluntary basis. Personal information collected on a 
      voluntary basis may include name, postal address, email 
      address, company name and telephone number.</p>
    <p>This information is collected if you request information 
      from us, participate in a contest or sweepstakes, and sign 
      up to join our email list or request some other service or 
      information from us. The information collected is internally 
      reviewed, used to improve the content of our website, notify 
      our visitors of updates, and respond to visitor inquiries.</p>
    <p>Once information is reviewed, it is discarded or stored in 
      our files. If we make material changes in the collection of 
      personally identifiable information we will inform you by 
      placing a notice on our site. Personal information received 
      from any visitor will be used only for internal purposes and 
      will not be sold or provided to third parties.</p>
    <p><strong>Use of Cookies and Web Beacons</strong></p>
    <p>We may use cookies to help you personalize your online 
      experience. Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to 
      your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to 
      enable our systems to recognize your browser. The purpose of 
      a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to 
      a specific page. For example, if you personalize the sites 
      pages, or register with any of our site's services, a cookie 
      enables <em>Coolest Parties</em> to recall your specific 
      information on subsequent visits.</p>
    <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by 
      modifying your Web browser; however, if you choose to 
      decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the 
      interactive features of the site.</p>
    <p>A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor 
      your journey around a single website or collection of sites. 
      They are also referred to as web bugs and are commonly used 
      by sites that hire third-party services to monitor traffic. 
      They may be used in association with cookies to understand 
      how visitors interact with the pages and content on the 
      pages of a web site.</p>
    <p>We may serve third party advertisements that use cookies and 
      web beacons in the course of ads being served on our web 
      site to ascertain how many times you've seen an 
      advertisement. No personally identifiable information you 
      give us is provided to them for cookie or web beacon use, so 
      they cannot personally identify you with that information on 
      our web site.</p>
    <p>Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify 
      you when a cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be 
      used to override web beacons. Taking either of these actions 
      shouldn't cause a problem with our site, should you so 
      choose.</p>

    <p>This website is directed to adults; it is not directed to 
      children under the age of 13. We operate our site in

      information from anyone under 13 years of age.</p>
    <p><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong></p>
    <p>In some cases, we may collect information about you that is 
      not personally identifiable. We use this information, which 
      does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to 
      administer the site, to track users' movements around the 
      site and to gather demographic information about our user 
      base as a whole. The information collected is used solely 
      for internal review and not shared with other organizations 
      for commercial purposes.</p>
    <p><strong>Release of Information</strong></p>
    <p>If <em>Coolest Parties</em> is sold, the information we have 
      obtained from you through your voluntary participation in 
      our site may transfer to the new owner as a part of the sale 
      in order that the service being provided to you may 
      continue. In that event, you will receive notice through our 
      website of that change in control and practices, and we will 
      make reasonable efforts to ensure that the purchaser honors 
      any opt-out requests you might make of us.</p>
