THAT NAMG COLLECTS ONLINE</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial"><br>
NAMG generally collects personally identifying information with your specific
knowledge and consent. For instance, when you enroll in a club, enter a
sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey, make a purchase, or register for any
portion of our services, you are asked to provide information such as your
e-mail address, mailing address, name or phone number. Optional information
such as your age or gender may also be requested. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Additionally, our web
server automatically collects click-stream information such as the address (or
"URL") of the website that you came from before visiting our site,
which pages you visit on our site, which browser you used to view our site and
any search terms you have entered on our site.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Whenever you request a page
from The Websites your IP address, browser and version, operating system, and
the site from which you came are stored in a log file. This information cannot
be used to identify a specific individual. This information is used for
statistical purposes in order to improve The Websites and provide accurate

in California may submit a request for disclosure of (1) the categories of
personal information that we may share with third parties, and (2) a list of
the names and addresses of all third parties with whom we have shared such
information for their marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. To

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">HOW NAMG USES
INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU </span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial"><br>
We use the information you provide in order to 1) fulfill requests for products,
services or information, 2) administer your membership accounts, 3) provide
member services, 4) administer contests or promotions, 5) offer new products
and services, 6) measure and improve the effectiveness of our websites or our
marketing endeavors, 7) tailor our online offerings to your preferences, and 8)
other business purposes. NAMG will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out
of having your information used for marketing communications.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">We may combine personal
information that you provide to us online with outside records to enhance our
ability to market products or provide services that we believe may be of
interest to you. In addition, we may share your information with our affiliates
and with carefully selected companies who we think can offer you services and
products of interest to you. If you do not wish to have your information
shared, write to us at <a href="mailto:optout@namginc.com">optout@namginc.com</a>.
</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Except as provided herein
so long as you activate your membership, NAMG will not sell to any third party
your email address unless you provide your informed consent, except to the
extent necessary to comply with applicable laws, police investigations, or in
legal proceedings where such information is relevant. Your informed consent
shall be in the form of an "opt in" or similar policy. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">NAMG allows access to
database information by third parties providing technical services, such as
e-mail, but only to the extent necessary to provide you with those services. In
those instances, the third party is bound by these terms. Your informed consent
shall be in the form of an "opt in" or similar policy. You understand
and agree that we may disclose to third parties your zip code, gender and/or
age, but only in the form of aggregated information. In addition, you agree
that we may assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party, your
name, address, email address, member name and any other personal information in
connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or
disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock of NAMG or its
affiliated entities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">We reserve the right to
offer you third party services and products based on the preferences that you
identify during the registration process or from information gathered from
surveys and based on your subsequent preferences; such offers may be provided
to you by NAMG.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">We reserve the right to
terminate your account if we learn that you have provided NAMG with false or
misleading registration information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">We may also disclose users'
personal information if we believe that we are required to do so (i) by law,
(ii) to comply with legal process or governmental requests, (iii) to enforce

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">THIRD PARTY SERVICE
PROVIDERS</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><br>
We work with third parties who provide services including but not limited to
website hosting, order processing and fulfillment, credit card clearance,
e-commerce affiliation, data analysis, emailing and other services of an
administrative nature. Personal information, including financial information,
is shared with such third parties for the purpose of providing such services.<br>
<br>
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These
companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs
or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that
these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely
anonymous. </span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">COOKIES</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><br>
"Cookies" are small text files a website can use to recognize repeat
users, facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of the site and allow
tracking of usage behavior. Cookies are used to compile aggregate data that
allows content improvements and targeted advertising. We share aggregated data
(information that does not identify you) with third parties. Some of our
advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over
cookies placed by advertisers. If you do not want non-personal information
about your visits collected through the use of cookies, you may set your
computer to deny or accept the cookie feature through a simple process in most
browsers; however, without cookies we may be unable to provide you with certain
features (e.g., customized or personalized delivery of information) otherwise
available on The Websites. </span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">CHILDREN<br>
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The Websites are not
directed at children under the age of 18. If you are under 18, please do not
provide any personal information on The Websites. We will not knowingly or
intentionally collect personal information online from children under the age
of 18.</span></b></p>

font-family:Arial;color:black">Users of forums and message/bulletin boards that
may be on The Websites should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose
personally identifiable information (e.g., name, e-mail address, etc.) on a
message/bulletin board, in a chat area, or other interactive area where
personal information can be posted, the information can be collected and used
by other internet users. This may result in unsolicited messages from other
posters or parties. We make no representations and undertake no obligations as
to the security of information you voluntarily post in chat rooms and
message/bulletin boards. Please refer to the </span><span style="font-size:

of these services. </span></p>

TOOLS</span></strong><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><br>
</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">The
Websites may, from time to time, include a send-to-a-friend application that
makes it easy for you to forward information or materials from The Websites to
friends or family by e-mail. In order to address your e-mail message, the
application will ask you to input the recipient’s e-mail address and/or similar
information (including your e-mail address). This information is only used by
the application to address your message so that it can be properly sent. NAMG
does not retain any of this information for any purpose.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">LINKS TO THIRD PARTY
SITES</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><br>
<span style="color:black">Some of The Websites may from time to time partner
with a retailer or other third party to offer online shopping opportunities,
games, services, subscriptions and other applications on a co-branded or
cross-promotional basis. Those transactions may take place on a NAMG site, or
the site of the third party. In either case, personal information you provide
in connection with the transaction may be shared with the third party, as well
as with any participating sponsors or advertisers of such opportunities and
features. </span>The Websites may contain links to third-party websites. This
Privacy Policy does not apply to other websites that may be accessible through
The Websites. The linked sites are not under the control of NAMG, and we are
not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any linked site,
or any link contained in a linked site. We are providing these links only as a
convenience, and the inclusion of a link on our websites does not imply
endorsement of the linked site by NAMG. We encourage you to read the privacy
policies of those other sites to learn how they collect and use information
about you.</span></p>

<p><span class="headtext1"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black">USER NAMES AND PASSWORDS</span></span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:black"><br>
Some areas of The Websites require you to select a user name and password.
Users will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any user name
and password, and we will not be responsible for misuse of any user names or
passwords by any third party, whether authorized by a user or not. </span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">SECURITY</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><br>
NAMG maintains practices and procedures designed to ensure the security,
integrity and confidentiality of personal information collection through the
Sites. A firewall protects the e-mail server to which all personal information
is delivered. Access to the information is limited to those employees and
contractors who need it to carry out their business functions. NAMG's employees
are educated about the importance of safeguarding personal information and
preventing unauthorized access, disclosure and use. Finally, we use secure
server software ("SSL") that encrypts credit card information
(including your name and address) submitted to any of The Websites. This
encryption protects this information so it cannot be viewed as it is
transmitted over the Internet. </span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">UNITED
STATES ONLY</span></strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;

State of Minnesota in the United States of America. If you are located outside
of the United States of America and you contact us, please be advised that any
information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States of America and that by submitting information, you explicitly authorize its
transfer.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">OPT-OUT</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><br>
You may inform us if you wish to remove your personal information from our
database, and we will comply with your request as soon as reasonably possible.
Please note that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping
purposes, and there may also be residual information that will remain within
our databases and other records. We reserve the right, from time to time, to
re-contact former users of The Websites.</span></p>
