# Cool Quotes-Privacy Policy

Cool Quotes is very respectful about the privacy concerns of the visitors to its web sites. Cool Quotes also recognizes the valuable potential of technology to help people communicate with the companies whose web sites they visit, particularly through customer databases. Responsible use of the information you share with Cool Quotes is paramount. In order to help you understand the role technology plays in the collection and use of information you provide Cool Quotes, the following guidelines have been created.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

In general, you can visit the Cool Quotes site while remaining anonymous by not providing any personal information.

**Personally Identifiable Information**

Cool Quotes will not collect any personally identifiable information about you (e.g., your name, address, telephone number, or email address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily (e.g., when entering contests or sweepstakes).

Cool Quote's purpose for gathering such information is to enhance your online experience by understanding you better and also to make you aware of new programs or offers in which you may be interested. When you do provide us with personally identifiable information, we will take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us. In this regard, we will not give, sell or otherwise transfer your personal information to anyone outside the Cool Quotes organization unless we first disclose it to you at the time of collection.

**Children under 18 Years of Age**

Cool Quotes has no intention of collecting any personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, telephone number, or email address) from individuals under eighteen (18) years of age. Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, Cool Quotes will not provide any personally identifying information it knowingly receives from individuals under 18 to any third party for any purposes whatsoever. Where appropriate, Cool Quotes will specifically instruct individuals under 18 not to submit such information on our web sites or advertisements without the consent of a parent or guardian.

If a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian of that child should contact us at coolquotes@earthlink.net if they would like this information deleted from our records. We will use all reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our existing files. Parents are also encouraged to spend time online with their children to become familiar with the types of editorial content and interactive functionality available on the site. Control tools are available from online services and software manufacturers to create a safe environment for kids.

**Use of Cookies**

When you view our web site or advertisements, we may store some information on your computer. This information is stored in the form of a "Cookie" or similar standard file and will help us in many ways. For example, cookies let us tailor our web site or advertisements to better match your interests and preferences. With most internet browsers, you have the option to erase cookie files from your computer's hard drive, and can also set preferences that allow you to block all cookies, or request your permission before creating a cookie. Please refer to your browser's instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions on your browser.

**Other Sensitive Information**

Cool Quotes will take appropriate steps to protect all information you share with us. Whenever you give Cool Quotes sensitive information (credit card numbers, for instance), Cool Quotes will take commercially reasonable steps to establish a secure connection with your web browser. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are never retained for marketing purposes.

**How to Update or Delete Your Personal Information**

You can help Cool Quotes to maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying us of any change to your address, phone number or email address. If at any time you wish to stop receiving communication from Cool Quotes or if you would like us to remove your personal information from our files, you can contact us by email at coolquotes@earthlink.net.
