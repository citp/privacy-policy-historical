 **Affiliate Links (Affiliate Policy) and Advertising:**

I try to provide great content that I think my readers, will find valuable and helpful.

To help make ends meet, I sometimes accept compensation in the form of advertising, sponsored posts, and affiliate links.

The ads on Cooking LSL are provided by Mediavine.

Through the process of serving ads, cookies are used to collect information.

Cooking LSL participates in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.

An affiliate program is a relationship with a company that allows Cooking LSL to receive a commission on sales I refer from my website.

I have an affiliate account with Amazon.  If you click on a link in any of my posts and make a purchase, I may receive a small commission on that sale.   Your price always remains the same; it is not higher.

I am always happy when a referral to Amazon results in a commission, but your participation is entirely voluntary.

If you don’t want to participate in the Amazon affiliate program, once you know the name of the product, you can open a new browser window for Amazon and just search for it directly. [
