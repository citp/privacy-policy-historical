Coolpad’s website, online services, email messages, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help Coolpad better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of the Coolpad Services have been accessed, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.
