#### Use of your information

The information that we ask for is generally used to provide goods and services to you. While we do not generally disclose personal information to third parties, we may need to disclose personal information to persons who perform services for us to enable us to provide the goods and services to you (e.g. carriers). Those parties are required to comply with the Privacy Act. We will not use or disclose any personal information that we collect about you other than for the purpose for which you have given it to us, as set out in this Privacy Policy, or as disclosed to you at the time we collect the information. If the information will be disclosed or used for other purposes, we will take reasonable steps to obtain your prior consent. 

We may also contact you about products and services in which we believe you may be interested. When we contact you in this manner without your prior consent, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt out of any further similar communications from us.

If a person makes an access request, we will need to validate their identity to ensure that we do not provide information to anyone who does not have the right to that information. If you believe that the personal information we hold on you is not accurate, complete or up to date, then you may ask us to amend it. 

If you wish to correct or update your information, or raise any specific concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at any of the above addresses. 

### Cookies

Cookies are small data files that are downloaded from our web servers and stored on your hard drive. A cookie is a string of letters and numbers that uniquely identify the computer you are using and the customer number and access code you may have used to register at the Site. We use cookies to store visitor's preferences, record session information such as items that visitors add to their shopping cart, record past activity at the Site in order to provide better service when visitors return to the Site, customise Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends. You can delete cookies from your hard drive, but doing so may hinder your access to valuable areas of information within the Site. 

### Security

We always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged on the Site. All data is stored on dedicated servers, located in Australia, using EVSSL encryption. The security of our visitors' information is of great importance to us, and we will take all reasonable precautions to ensure that your details are protected. 

We take great care with the information we hold about you. Our aim is to ensure that any details are securely protected from misuse, loss, and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We will take reasonable care to make sure that we keep your information in an accurate, complete and up to date manner. When that information is no longer needed, it will be permanently destroyed or de-identified. 

Whilst it is true that no system is ever completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented provide appropriate protection. 

You may be able to access external websites by clicking on links we have provided on the Site. However, these websites are not subject to our privacy standards, policies and procedures, and we expressly disclaim any loss or liability arising in relation to your access to, or any information you disclose on, those websites. You will need to contact or review those websites directly to ascertain their privacy standards, policies and procedures. 

### If you have a complaint

We value our Members and customers. We will always aim to be fair and responsive. If you have a complaint, you have the right to expect that we will handle it in a friendly and professional way. When we receive a complaint, we look on it as valuable feedback that may help us to improve the services we offer and to ensure your needs are met in a satisfactory and appropriate manner.
