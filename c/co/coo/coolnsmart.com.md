The following Privacy Statement discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for coolnsmart.com

Our site, like most other sites, uses cookies to provide you with a more personalized experience. A cookie is a message that is sent to a web browser from a Web server and stored on your computer. Cookies help in keeping track of the size of our visitors, the frequency of visits to our website and the sections that are most popular.

We may also log IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration. In some cases your IP address stays the same from one browser session to another; but if you use a consumer Internet access provider such as AOL or Earthlink, chances are that your IP address is not static, it varies with each session, thus making it effectively impossible for us to use your IP address to determine who you are.
