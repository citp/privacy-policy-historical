      <p>CoolHomepages is strongly committed to protecting the 
                    privacy of consumers of its interactive products and services 
                    and of visitors to its site. Throughout cyberspace, we want 
                    to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for 
                    consumers. All references in this policy to "CoolHomepages" 
                    include the CoolHomepages site and all of the other Internet-accessible 
                    CoolHomepages-branded services. The purpose of this CoolHomepages 
                    privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to CoolHomepages, 
                    (1) what kinds of information we may gather about you when 
                    you visit CoolHomepages; (2) how we may use that information; 
                    (3) whether we disclose it to anyone; and (4) the choices 
                    you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, 
                    the information. Finally, please note that this policy applies 
                    only to CoolHomepages and Web sites that carry the CoolHomepages 
                    brand, and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites 
                    to which we link. We have clearly marked CoolHomepages 
                    and these branded Web sites with our logo so you know where 
                    this policy applies. CoolHomepages welcomes comments and 
                    questions on this policy. CoolHomepages is dedicated to 
                    protecting your personal information. Due to the evolving 
                    nature of the technologies CoolHomepages uses to communicate 
                    with you, we may occasionally update this policy. Notice of 
                    any revisions will be posted to this site. Any comments or 
                    questions regarding our privacy practices should be sent to us via our Contact Us page. </p> 
      <p><b>What personal information does CoolHomepages collect? 
                    </b></p> 
      <p>CoolHomepages collects personally identifying information 
                    during: (i) user registration; (ii) user surveys; and (iv) 
                    registration for certain interactive areas on CoolHomepages 
                    and on Web sites that carry the CoolHomepages brand. For 
                    each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically 
                    recognizes and we collect that visitor's domain name and e-mail 
                    address (where possible). In addition, the e-mail addresses 
                    of those who communicate with us via e-mail, the e-mail addresses 
                    of those who make postings to our interactive areas, aggregate 
                    information about which pages visitors access, user-specific 
                    information about which pages visitors access and how much 
                    time is spent in particular areas, and information volunteered 
                    by the visitor, such as survey information and/or information 
                    provided in site registration forms, including but not limited 
                    to a visitor's name, address, and phone number. We collect 
                    credit card information along with a billing address from 
                    users who use our system to gain project work, and who then 
                    wish to pay us by credit card. CoolHomepages may retain 
                    personally identifying information indefinitely. CoolHomepages 
                    maintains publicly available user profiles as well, which 
                    may contain personally identifying information volunteered 
                    by its visitors. </p> 
      <p><b>What does CoolHomepages do with the information it 
                    collects? </b></p> 
      <p>CoolHomepages may use personally identifying information 
                    of its visitors to award prizes, track compliance with our 
                    Terms of Service, or for editorial and feedback purposes (to 
                    the extent that is explained when visitors provide the information). 
                    CoolHomepages also may make the e-mail addresses of those 
                    who access our site available to other organizations whose 
                    products or services we think you might find interesting. 
                    In addition, CoolHomepages may disclose personally identifying 
                    information about you, your accounts, or any content you provide 
                    on your site, if CoolHomepages believes in good faith 
                    that such action is reasonably necessary to enforce its User 
                    Agreement or copyright policy, to comply with the law, to 
                    comply with legal process, to operate its systems properly, 
                    or to protect the rights or property of itself, its members, 
                    its visitors, or others. CoolHomepages may collect and 
                    disclose such material for use in promoting CoolHomepages 
                    or its services or if CoolHomepages believes in good faith 
                    that such action is reasonably necessary to enforce its User 
                    Agreement or copyright policy, to comply with the law, to 
                    comply with legal process, to operate its systems properly, 
                    or to protect the rights or property of itself, its members, 
                    its visitors, or others. Other companies which provide services 
                    on our site, or which advertise on our site, may collect information 
                    about you. CoolHomepages does not control collection or 
                    use of this information. You should contact these companies 
                    or advertisers directly if you have any questions about their 
                    use of this information. With the permission of a visitor 
                    who is 18 years of age or over, information submitted at the 
                    time of registration or submission - including but not limited 
                    to age, phone number, address, and income level - may be used 
                    for marketing and promotional purposes by CoolHomepages 
                    and may be shared with companies that have been pre-screened 
                    by CoolHomepages. If a visitor objects to such use for 
                    any reason, he/she may stop that use -- either by e-mail request 
                    sent via our Contact Us page, or by modifying his/her 
                    registration information online. If you supply us with your 
                    postal address on-line you may receive periodic mailings from 
                    us with information on new products and services or upcoming 
                    events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please 
                    let us know by sending an e-mail to us at the above e-mail 
                    address and providing us with your exact name and address. 
                    We also will notify other organizations with whom we share 
                    such information and request that they remove your information 
                    from their mailing lists. </p> 
      <p><b>How will CoolHomepages protect your personal information? 
                    </b></p> 
      <p>CoolHomepages will take appropriate steps to protect 
                    the information you share with us. Whenever you give CoolHomepages 
                    sensitive information (credit card numbers, for instance), 
                    CoolHomepages will take commercially reasonable steps 
                    to establish a secure connection with your web browser. Credit 
                    card numbers are used only for payment processing and are 
                    not retained for marketing purposes. </p> 
      <p><b>How to update personal information </b></p> 
      <p>You can help CoolHomepages to maintain the accuracy of 
                    your information by notifying us of any change to your address, 
                    title, phone number, or e-mail address. If at any time you 
                    wish to modify your information or stop receiving communications 
                    from CoolHomepages, you can contact CoolHomepages via our Contact Us page . Please include 
                    your e-mail address in the message. </p> 
      <p><b>How to unsubscribe </b></p> 
      <p>From time to time, we make the e-mail addresses of those 
                    who access our site available to other organizations whose 
                    products or services we think you might find interesting. 
                    If you do not want us to share your e-mail address with other 
                    companies or organizations, please let us know by sending 
                    an e-mail to us at the above address and telling us that you 
                    do not want us to share your e-mail address with other companies. 
                  </p> 
      <p><b>About IP addresses </b></p> 
      <p>CoolHomepages collects IP addresses for the purposes 
                    of system administration and to report aggregate information 
                    to our advertisers. An IP address is a number that is automatically 
                    assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. 
                    Web servers -- the big computers that "serve" up Web pages 
                    -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 
                    When visitors request pages from CoolHomepages, our servers 
                    log their IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to any 
                    personally identifiable information. This means that a user's 
                    session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to 
                    us.<span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> <b> 
        <p>Use 
                    of cookies</p> </b> 
      <p>What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information 
                    that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for 
                    record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for 
                    you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while 
                    you're at our site. The use of cookies is an industry standard 
                    -- you'll find them at most major Web sites. By showing how 
                    and when guests use the site, cookies help us see which areas 
                    are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates 
                    to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors 
                    and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked 
                    with cookies. If you accept the first tracking cookie from 
                    CoolHomepages, you won't be offered as many afterwards. 
                  </p> 
      <p>Each browser accessing CoolHomepages is 
                    given a unique cookie that is then used to determine the number 
                    of unique site visitors. An additional cookie lets our computers 
                    remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed 
                    up your future activities at our sites.</p> 
      <p>By using this site, you signify your assent 
                    to the CoolHomepages Privacy Policy. If you do not agree 
                    to this policy, please do not use the site. We reserve the 
                    right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove

                    periodically for changes. Your continued use of CoolHomepages 
                    following the posting of changes to these terms will mean
