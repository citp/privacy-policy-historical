                  <p>CoolHomepages.com is strongly committed to protecting the 
                    privacy of consumers of its interactive products and services 
                    and of visitors to its site. Throughout cyberspace, we want 
                    to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for 
                    consumers. All references in this policy to "CoolHomepages.com" 
                    include the CoolHomepages.com site and all of the other Internet-accessible 
                    CoolHomepages.com-branded services. The purpose of this CoolHomepages.com 
                    privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to CoolHomepages.com, 
                    (1) what kinds of information we may gather about you when 
                    you visit CoolHomepages.com; (2) how we may use that information; 
                    (3) whether we disclose it to anyone; and (4) the choices 
                    you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, 
                    the information. Finally, please note that this policy applies 
                    only to CoolHomepages.com and Web sites that carry the CoolHomepages.com 
                    brand, and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites 
                    to which we link. We have clearly marked CoolHomepages.com 
                    and these branded Web sites with our logo so you know where 
                    this policy applies. CoolHomepages.com welcomes comments and 
                    questions on this policy. CoolHomepages.com is dedicated to 
                    protecting your personal information. Due to the evolving 
                    nature of the technologies CoolHomepages.com uses to communicate

                  <p>CoolHomepages.com collects personally identifying information

                    and on Web sites that carry the CoolHomepages.com brand. For 
                    each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically 
                    recognizes and we collect that visitor's domain name and e-mail 
                    address (where possible). In addition, the e-mail addresses 
                    of those who communicate with us via e-mail, the e-mail addresses 
                    of those who make postings to our interactive areas, aggregate 
                    information about which pages visitors access, user-specific 
                    information about which pages visitors access and how much 
                    time is spent in particular areas, and information volunteered 
                    by the visitor, such as survey information and/or information 
                    provided in site registration forms, including but not limited 
                    to a visitor's name, address, and phone number. We collect 
                    credit card information along with a billing address from 
                    users who use our system to gain project work, and who then 
                    wish to pay us by credit card. CoolHomepages.com may retain 
                    personally identifying information indefinitely. CoolHomepages.com 
                    maintains publicly available user profiles as well, which

                  <p><b>About IP addresses </b></p>
                  <p>CoolHomepages.com collects IP addresses for the purposes 
                    of system administration and to report aggregate information 
                    to our advertisers. An IP address is a number that is automatically 
                    assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. 
                    Web servers -- the big computers that "serve" up Web pages 
                    -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 
                    When visitors request pages from CoolHomepages.com, our servers 
                    log their IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to any 
                    personally identifiable information. This means that a user's 
                    session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to 
                    us.<font size="-2"></font><font size="-2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

                  <p>What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information 
                    that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for 
                    record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for 
                    you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while 
                    you're at our site. The use of cookies is an industry standard 
                    -- you'll find them at most major Web sites. By showing how 
                    and when guests use the site, cookies help us see which areas 
                    are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates 
                    to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors 
                    and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked 
                    with cookies. If you accept the first tracking cookie from 
                    CoolHomepages.com, you won't be offered as many afterwards. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Each browser accessing CoolHomepages.com is 
                    given a unique cookie that is then used to determine the number 
                    of unique site visitors. An additional cookie lets our computers 
                    remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed 
                    up your future activities at our sites.</p>
