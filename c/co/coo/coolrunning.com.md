# Cool Running :: Privacy Policy

Cool Sports, Inc has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: www.coolrunning.com. 

Information Automatically Logged  
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to gather broad demographic information (for example, to understand the geographic location of our visitors in the aggregate). 

Cookies  
Our site uses "cookies" (small files stored on your computer's hard drive) to deliver content specific to your interests. We also use cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. 

Registration Forms  
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name, email, and postal address), unique identifiers (like their social security number), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). 

Contact information from the registration forms is used to ship purchases, information about our company, and to send promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary, and to share with other companies who may want to contact our customers. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings from Cool Sports, Inc., or our partners; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

Surveys  
Our occasional online surveys may track visitors' answers to their unique user names. These surveys are used to collect demographic and profile data (like age, gender, and income level) to be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. No individual information is ever given out to a third party without your permission. We link users' answers to their unique user names only so that we may automatically fill out the survey with their last answers should the users visit the survey page a second time. 

External Links  
This site contains links to other sites. Cool Sports, Inc is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

Our Partner Sites  
The Cool Running site also includes links to sites owned by our commerce partners (including, but not limited to, Amazon.com and SignMeUpSports.com). These sites are not covered by our privacy policy. We do not share any user information with these sites. Any information provided to our partners, including ordering information, is governed by the privacy policy of the partner sites. 

Likewise, any exchange of information that takes place during race registration conducted from the Cool Running race calendar is governed by the privacy policy of the relevant race registration firm (including, but not limited to, Racegate.com, ActiveUSA.com, and SignMeUpSports.com). 

Public Forums  
This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

Security  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. All membership files are in secure directories, and all information is backed up on daily basis. 

Children's Guidelines  
We care about children and understand that they have special privacy needs. Therefore, we have adopted the following privacy policy regarding children: 

Our terms of use requires that users be 13 years of age to register. As a result, our policy is that we do not collect any personal information about children. Also as a result of our terms of use, children may not have access to unmonitored chat rooms, message boards, e-mail accounts, or other services that would give the child the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental consent. We do not, however, have the ability to prevent a child from registering in violation of our terms of use. 

We will provide the parent a description of the specific types of a personally identifiable information collected from their child upon request. We will allow the parent to refuse further use or future online collection of personally identifiable information and provide a way for a parent to obtain any personally identifiable information collected from their child. 

We will NOT provide any links to Web sites that are unsuitable for children. 

Choice/Opt-Out  
Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving promotional or marketing information from us as well as our partners.
