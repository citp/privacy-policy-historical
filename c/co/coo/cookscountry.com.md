# Privacy Policy - Cook's Country

We at America's Test Kitchen (and related brands including Cook's Illustrated and Cook's Country) are committed to respecting your privacy. We recognize the need for appropriate protection of personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified, including name, address, email address, or credit card information). The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you of what personally identifiable information or personal information we may collect from you when you visit our websites, and how we use such information. This policy applies only to users accessing our websites from the United States. 

To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles, and assure you that we take reasonable steps to see that it is followed within our company: 

##  Information About You 

There are times when we may collect personal information from you. For example, when you register with America’s Test Kitchen for one of our websites, cooking courses, electronic newsletters, product giveaways, surveys, or other services, personal information is requested. Furthermore, you may be asked, when entering personal information into one of our third party hosted applications (our iPad App as an example), whether you agree to have information shared with America’s Test Kitchen. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit parts of our websites, but you may be unable to access certain content, offers, and services. 

We (or third party service providers on our behalf) may set and access cookies and similar technologies on your computer. The information collected may include, without limitation, information regarding your computer or device, browser, connection speed, geographic location of your computer, or other device, as well as date/time stamp, IP address, pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, the site(s), application(s), destination(s), and/or service(s) you arrived from, and other clickstream data. If you don’t want cookies, most Web browsers include an option that allows you to not accept them. However, if you set your browser to refuse cookies, some portions of our sites may not function as intended. In addition we may receive information from third parties, including demographic information on site visitors (age, gender, and interests). 

##  Use of Information About You 

America’s Test Kitchen uses the information we collect from site visitors in part to understand site usage and control the content and offerings on our sites. For example, a cookie is used to identify a registrant or member who has logged in, allowing their computer or device to remain logged in for an extended period of time. Demographic information is used for analyzing and understanding site usage and is not used for presentation of ads or offers. 

From time to time, we are approached by companies or organizations that have a product or service that we believe might be of interest to you. We may share some your information with these companies so that they can communicate their products or services to you (we never share telephone or credit card numbers with any third party). You may receive a telemarketing sales call although your number is listed on the state or national ‘Do Not Call’ list. Please note the law allows contact if the two parties already do business or have done business in the recent past. 

Your email address is added to our electronic mailing list so that, from time to time, we can send you our newsletters or information about special promotions from America’s Test Kitchen. 

Email addresses registered to our TV show websites are sometimes shared with third party underwriters of our television shows. Registrants have the opportunity to opt-out of these third party communications at the time that they register. Email addresses registered to CooksIllustrated.com are not shared with third parties. 

##  Accuracy 

We do our best to maintain the accuracy of the personal information you supply to us. 

##  Public Forums 

This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

Content posted in these public forums becomes the sole property of America’s Test Kitchen (and all its related brands). America’s Test Kitchen reserves the right to use content posted in these public forums for business purposes including, but not limited to, inclusion in publications and marketing. 

##  Security 

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All orders are communicated to us via a secure server.

##  Your California Privacy Rights 

Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to [caprivacy@bcpress.com](mailto:caprivacy@bcpress.com).
