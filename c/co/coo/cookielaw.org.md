Optanon Auditor Data Collection

The Optanon Auditor and its associated plug-in for Google Chrome gathers data about cookies and submits it to our database.

This data contains information both about the cookies found, and the pages on a particular site they were found on.  It also contains values of cookies, which in some circumstances may contain personally identifiable information - if the cookie is designed to hold such information.  Such information is only ever used to help us identify the purpose of a cookie, where a website owner has requested this service from us.  The data is only available to us and our clients who use the auditor for specific websites.

We do not use any personally identifiable information for any other purpose, and nor do we make it available in any other way.

All submissions of data via the Optanon Auditor are otherwise completely anonymous.  If using the plug-in, no information is collected about the device the plug-in is installed on, or the person using the device.  No browsing history, other than a record pf pages that set cookies, is complied, and no profile linked to a device can be created from the data.

The names and some attributes of the cookies gathered by the auditor are made publicly available on the [Cookiepedia](http://cookiepedia.co.uk/ "Cookiepedia") website.  However there is to our knowledge no personal information contained within this data.

Privacy Detective Cookiepedia Plug-in 

Aside from the Optanon Auditor, our [Privacy Detective](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookiepedia-privacy-detec/oicbhgcaoofklplaiijhkkcmflkenmij "Privacy Detective") plug-in for Google Chrome submits data about cookies to our systems.  This is done automatically, without any kind of user input or control. 

The data consists of the names of cookies and their other attributes, along with the top level domain name of the site being visited by the browser, when the data was submitted.  The values (contents) of the cookies are not stored, nor the specific pages of the site they were found on.  We do not identify the source of the data submitted back to a particular copy of the plug-in. We therefore believe that no personal data is collected by the Privacy Detective.

The sole purpose of the plug-in is to source data about cookies to inform our research.  Statistics and other intelligence garnered from analysis of this data are published freely on [Cookiepedia](http://cookiepedia.co.uk/ "Cookiepedia - all about cookies").

Prior to this plug-in there were two Cookie Collector plug-ins, for Firefox and Chrome available.  Data collection from these plug-ins is no longer taking place.

Where we store your personal data

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for one of our suppliers.

By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Disclosure of your information

We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.

We may disclose your personal information to third parties:

  * If Governor Technology or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
  * If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use or terms and conditions of supply and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Governor Technology, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.



Your rights

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. 

You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998. If you would like a copy of the information held on you please write to info@cookielaw.org

If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please write to or email us as soon as possible, at the above address. We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect.

Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.

Links to Other Websites

We may from time to time publish links to other websites we believe to be of interest. However we have no control over these sites, which are not governed by this privacy policy.
