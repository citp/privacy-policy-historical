# Cool math - Privacy Policy

**Coolmath.com is a Member of the Aristotle Integrity’s Children’s Privacy Compliance Program. This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for Coolmath.com and the Coolmath family of sites (Coolmath4kids.com, Coolmath-Games.com, CoolifiedGames.com SpikesGameZone.com, ScienceMonster.com, FinanceFREAK.com, TotallyStressedOut.com, Coolmath4parents.com and Coolmath4teachers.com)**

__

**We at Coolmath.com, Inc. want everyone's visit here to be enjoyable and safe. This privacy policy tells you what information we collect on the Coolmath network of sites, and how we maintain and use such information. If we make any changes to this Policy, they will be posted on this page and will be effective when posted. Your continued use of the Coolmath network of sites following the posting of any change shows your acceptance of the changes.**

**Information Collected**

**Coolmath does not collect ANY user information and does not disclose ANY information to third parties.   Nothing.   **

**Website Traffic Analysis**

**For our traffic tracking, we use Google Analytics and comScore.   These services use cookies (not the yummy kind) to gather anonymous data about our users.  The information gathered are things like your IP address ****(that's a special number that your internet service provider uses)** **, your state, what pages you visited while on Coolmath and how long you were on each page.   This information is used only for internal purposes and is invaluable to us because it lets us know what you like and want more of, so we can continue to make Coolmath better.  It's also really important for us to be able to track our traffic so we know when we need to upgrade our servers!  Without this info, we wouldn't have a clue!**

**Website Advertising**

**For our advertising, we use The Rubicon Project and Glam.   These companies use cookies to track their ads, not our users!  They only gather anonymous user data such as your city (so they don't show a New York car dealer ad to someone in California).  Without cookies, the complicated process of placing ads on websites cannot function, but it's thanks to these great agencies that Coolmath can be free for everyone!  (They help buy food for my cats, too.)  **

**None of our advertising is behaviorally targeted.   We have asked all of our advertising networks to turn off all behaviorally targeted ads that would track a user or attempt to create a profile on any of our users.  We have also alerted our advertising agencies that we have a large "under 13" audience and that they need to adhere to all COPPA rules and regulations.**

**Cookies**

**Cookies and beacons are industry standard for website traffic tracking (for sites and advertisers) and you will receive them from, virtually, every website you visit.    The cookies and beacons used by our analytics and advertisers do NOT track our users or creative user profiles.  Our goal at Coolmath is to have these tools used as safely as possible with our users.  To this end, we are very careful to only work with the most reputable of advertising agencies.   We have been assured that they strictly adhere to all IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) policies and fully comply with all privacy laws, including COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.)  **

**Rubicon is an an optimizing company that works with lots of other agencies such as Advertising.com.   We want to let you know about one cookie, in particular, that you will see coming from them.  **

**The cookie is called "leadback.advertising.com."   **

**Typically, a leadback cookie is a user tracker, but not in our case.   Advertising.com told us that this is a "call" to comScore to find out what category our sites fall into (education, family, etc.)  Without being able to target a user in the pre-COPPA way, they are finding out the type of users we have in a safe way!  They do not store this data in the user cookie.**

**Coolmath only uses cookies to track game progress and level completion.**

**Here is more information about online advertising that's put out by the IAB, so you can learn more about all of this:**

It is important for you to talk with your child about using the Internet safely. Here are just a few things to keep in mind when talking to your kids about the Internet:  
* Remind your child to never give out his or her full name, address, or phone number without your permission.  
* Tell your child that if he or she receives something that he or she is not sure about, to let you know.  
* Impress upon your child the importance of never engaging others in a communication that would put him or her at risk, such as agreeing to meet someone he or she has been "chatting" with, but never met.
