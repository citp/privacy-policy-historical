#### INFORMATION WE COLLECT UPON SIGN-UP

We collect and store information that you have explicitly provide to us through forms on our website when you sign up. For example, when you purchase our products and create a website membership, we collect various pieces of personal information such as name, email, and payment information. We do not record or store any payment information. Your credit card and banking information is kept with our payment processor Stripe. You can read more about their [privacy policy here](https://stripe.com/us/privacy).

We only use your personal and payment information to charge you for the services you choose to receive and to be able to provide you with those services.

#### INFORMATION WE COLLECT UPON LOG-IN

When you log into our service, your computer automatically provides your Internet Protocol (IP) address (this is not your email address and cannot be used directly to contact you), information about the request, and certain information about the capabilities of your computer.

We may use this automatically provided information for analytical purposes, to help diagnose errors, and to identify abuse of our systems.

#### USE OF EMAIL ADDRESSES

When you create an account, you will receive a one-time email message with your account information. We will send you a weekly notification email when plans are posted. We will also send you receipts for payments via email. We may contact you by email from time to time to notify you of updates to the services or other related matters which may be of interest to you. If we do, we will provide a clear method to opt-out of future messages which are not account, meal plan, or payment related. Otherwise, you will receive email from us only in response to a message or request from you.
