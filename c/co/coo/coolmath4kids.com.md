# Cool Math - Privacy Policy

Effective Date: April 8, 2015

**This Privacy Policy Applies to Our Sites and Apps**

This Policy describes how we treat personal information on the websites where it is located. It describes information we collect from both children and adults.  It also applies to our Coolmath Games app. By interacting with us, you consent to these practices.

This policy does not apply to other Coolmath websites, including coolmath-games.com. [View the Coolmath Games Privacy Policy](http://www.coolmath-games.com/privacyp).

**We Collect Information From and About Users**

If a person uses our website, we may collect information about their browser used or IP address. We might look at what site a user came from, or visits next.  We may also collect information about what activity the user did or how long the user stayed on our site. If you use our mobile app, we might collect device identifiers. We might look at how often you use the app and where you downloaded it.

**We Collect Information Passively**

For our traffic tracking, we use Google Analytics and Adobe analytics. These services use cookies (not the yummy kind) to help us understand our traffic. The information gathered is anonymous and is never tied to any information that may personally identify you. We use this data to understand things like what pages have been visited and how long our users stay on our site. This information is used only for internal purposes and is invaluable to us because it lets us know what you like and want more of, so we can continue to make Coolmath better. It's also really important for us to be able to understand our traffic so we know when we need to upgrade our servers! Without this info, we wouldn't have a clue!

**We Use Information as Disclosed and Described Here**

**We use information for analytics and to improve our products and services. **We might use information to customize a user’s experience with us.

**We use information as otherwise disclosed or permitted by law.**

**We May Share Information With Third Parties**

**We will share information with third parties who perform services on our behalf. **For example, we share information with vendors who operate our sites or provide analytics.

**We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves.** For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may share it if a government agency or investigatory body requests. We might share information when we are investigating potential fraud. 

**We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business.**

We do not currently respond to those signals.  If you block cookies, certain features on our sites may not work. If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop.
