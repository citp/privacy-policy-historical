This information may be used by Cookstr or the third party to provide you with advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

Cookstr may also provide visitors’ names and email addresses to a third party service provider with whom Cookstr contracts to profile customer purchasing behavior.

## Opting Out

At Cookstr, the choice is in the hands of our visitors. As stated above, you may have your personally or non-personally identifiable information removed from Cookstr's internal distribution to affiliated parties and Cookstr's future distribution to unaffiliated third parties at any time by simply choosing to OPT OUT. You may also OPT OUT:

  * if you do not want to receive e-mail commercial advertisements or promotions from us in the future; and/or
  * if you are an individual, and want to limit third party companies from marketing their products or services to you based on your personal information that we collect and share with them. This information may include such data as your income, your account history with us, and your credit score.



Your choice to limit marketing offers from third parties will apply for at least 5 years from when you tell us your choice unless you tell us to change your choice, in which event your opt-out choice will apply until your notification of such change. Once the 5-year opt-out period expires, you will receive a renewal notice that will allow you to continue to limit marketing offers from third party for at least another 5 years.

If you have already made a choice to limit marketing offers from third parties, you do not need to act again until you receive the renewal notice.
