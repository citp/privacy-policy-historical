CoolHomepages.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve" up Web pages \-- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When visitors request pages from CoolHomepages.com, our servers log their IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us.
