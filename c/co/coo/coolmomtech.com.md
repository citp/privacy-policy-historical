**HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY**

At Cool Mom Picks we consider your privacy to be extremely important. Hey, we visit lots of websites too. This privacy policy describes in detail the types of personal information collected and recorded here and how it’s used.

**Log Files**  
Like many other Web sites, we use log files which merely log visitors to the site. Pretty standard. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses, and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**  
Cool Mom Picks uses cookies to store information about visitors’ preferences, to record user-specific information on which pages the site visitor accesses or visits, and to personalize or customize our web page content based upon your browser type or other info your browser sends.

**DoubleClick DART Cookie**  
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads here. This enables them to serve ads to our visitors (that’s you) based on your visit here and to other sites. You may opt out of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy at http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.

**Our Advertising Partners**  
Some of our advertising partners and affiliate partners may use cookies and web beacons on our site. Our advertising partners include Google, Amazon, ShareASale, and RewardStyle. While each of these companies has their own Privacy Policy for their site, an updated and hyperlinked resource is maintained here: Privacy Policies. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology in their respective baners and links that appear on our site, and which are sent directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this occurs. Other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) may also be used by our site’s third-party ad networks to measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns and/or to personalize the advertising content that you see on the site. We have absolutely no access to or control over these cookies used by third-party advertisers.

If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your individual browser options.

**Email addresses**  
If you register with our site as a commenter, your email address will be stored in our system, however not used for any purposes except as to verify that you are you when you comment.

If you wish to unsubscribe from our newsletters at any time for any reason, by all means, click the “unsubscribe” link that appears at the bottom of every email. Just know we might cry.

**Children’s Information**  
We are parents, and believe it is incredibly important to provide added protection for children online. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to observe, participate in and/or monitor and guide their online activity. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, ever. If you believe for some reason that we have in our database the personally-identifiable information of a child under the age of 13, please contact us immediately at info@coolmompicks.com and we will do whatever we can to promptly remove it from our records.
