## Privacy Policy

## Recipe and Photography Copyright Policy

I am flattered that you want to use one of my recipes or pictures on your website. Thank you so much. However, a lot of time and money goes into each recipe on this site. From conceptualization of the recipe to grocery-shopping, testing the recipe multiple times, photographing the recipe, editing the pictures, writing the blog post –  you can see that each recipe takes over 10 hours to do. For this reason, I ask that you please respect my copyright and not use my recipes or images in ways that violate my wishes.

Here is how I like things to be done:

You may not use any of the recipes from this site without written permission. Obtain written permission from Christine at cookthestory@gmail.com. If you really really need to use one of my recipes, you must change at least 2 ingredients and also re-write the instructions in your own words. Otherwise you are violating my copyright. This is illegal.

If you re-write the recipe and post it online, you do not have my permission to use any of the images from my site. You will need to take pictures of your recipe for yourself.

If you want to feature my recipe and use my picture you may do so but only in the following way. You may use the title of my recipe only. Do not include the actual recipe. Link the title of the recipe to the recipe on my site. You may in this case use one image from my website. I think of this as advertising for my site. You are telling your reader that I have a recipe on my site that you think they would like. You are showing them a picture of it. Then you are saying, if you want this recipe, you have to go get it from COOKtheSTORY.

Thank you for respecting my copyright.

## Compensation Disclosure Policy

I am often compensated by companies to feature their products on this site and on social media. When I am compensated to feature a product I disclose the relationship in the specific blog post where the feature occurs, usually both at the top and the bottom of the blog post. In addition, I am compensated for running advertisements on this site. There are ad spaces on the right sidebar and sometimes at the bottom of a recipe, at the top of the site and at the bottom of the site. I also use affiliate links sometimes when mentioning products. This means that if you click on the link and then buy something while there I will be given a small percentage of the sale price at no additional  cost to you. When I use an affiliate link I usually disclose it at the bottom of the blog post. I am part of the Amazon associates affiliate link program:

Christine Pittman is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com.

While it is true that I am compensated by companies and I earn money from affiliate links, I am never compensated to give a dishonest opinion. Everything I write on this blog is what I believe. If I don’t like a product that I have been asked to promote, I tell the company that I didn’t like it and ask if they would still like me to give my honest opinion. They usually say no.
