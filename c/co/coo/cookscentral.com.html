                            A. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our Websites typically collect two (2) kinds of information about you: (a) information
                            that you provide that personally identifies you; and (b) information that does
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            1. Personally Identifiable Information: Our definition of personally identifiable
                            information includes any information that may be used to specifically identify or
                            contact you, such as your name, mail address, phone number, etc. As a general policy,
                            we do not automatically collect your personally identifiable information when you
                            visit our Websites. In certain circumstances, we may request, allow or otherwise
                            provide you an opportunity to submit your personally identifiable information in
                            connection with a feature, program, promotion or some other aspect of our Websites.
                            For instance, you may: (a) provide your name, mail/shipping address, e-mail address,
                            credit card number and phone number when registering with our Websites, using our
                            online store or in connection with a contest entry; (b) provide certain demographic
                            information about you (e.g., age, gender, purchase preference, usage frequency,
                            etc.) when participating in a survey, poll or joining a club; or (c) post a product
                            rating and recommendation on our Websites. Certain information may not be personally
                            identifiable when standing alone (e.g., your age), but may become so when combined
                            with other information (e.g., your age and name). Whether or not you provide this
                            information is your choice; however, in many instances this type of information
                            is required to participate in the particular activity, realize a benefit we may
                            offer or gain access to certain content on our Websites.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. Non-Personal Information: Our definition of non-personal information is any information
                            that does not personally identify you. Non-personal information can include certain
                            personally identifiable information that has been de-identified; that is, information
                            that has been rendered anonymous. We and/or our third party service providers obtain
                            non-personal information about you from information that you provide us, either
                            separately or together with your personally identifiable information. We and/or
                            our third party service providers also automatically collect certain non-personal
                            information from you when you access our Websites. Click here: <a href="http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/privacy/sitecensus.htm" target="_blank">http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/privacy/sitecensus.htm</a>

                            1. Personally Identifiable Information: The personally identifiable information
                            you submit to us is generally used to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries,
                            better serve you or in other ways naturally associated with the circumstances in

                            promotional information from us, or direct that we not share your information in
                            the future with any affiliated companies or third parties for their direct marketing
                            purposes, as set forth below in Section I.

                        <p>

                            our merchandise, administer our promotions, provide us marketing or promotional
                            assistance, analyze our data, assist us with customer service, etc. Our vendors
                            agree to use this information, and we share information with them, only to carry
                            out our requests. In addition, we may share your personally identifiable information
                            with participating sponsors to a program or promotion (e.g., a sweepstakes or contest)
                            you enter via our Websites, and with third parties who assist us in using the content
                            or other information you have posted or shared with us via our Websites (e.g., production
                            companies we may use). Further, we may share your personally identifiable information
                            with third parties such as our co-promotional partners and others with whom we have
                            marketing or other relationships. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, our
                            Terms of Use, or as set forth when you submit the information, your personally identifiable
                            information will not be shared or sold to third parties without your consent.

                            2. Non-Personal Information: In addition to any personally identifiable information
                            or other information that you choose to provide to us on the Websites, we and our
                            third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies, now and hereafter
                            devised, that automatically collect certain web site usage information whenever
                            you visit or interact with the Websites. This information may include browser type,
                            operating system, the page served, the time, the source of the request, the preceding
                            page view, and other similar information. We may use this usage information for
                            a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Websites. In
                            addition, we may also collect your IP address or some other unique identifier for
                            the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively,
                            referred to herein as a “Device Identifier”). A Device Identifier is a number that
                            is automatically assigned to your Computer, and we may identify your device by its
                            Device Identifier. When analyzed, usage information helps us determine how our Websites
                            are used, such as what types of visitors arrive at the Websites, what type of content
                            is most popular, what type of content you may find most relevant and what type of
                            visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising. We may associate
                            your Device Identifier or web site usage information with the personally identifiable
                            information you provide, but we will treat the combined information as personally
                            identifiable information. Web site usage information may be collected using various
                            methods, such as the following:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Web Beacons - Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons
                            (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and
                            e-mail messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or
                            other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.
                            Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including,
                            without limitation, to count visitors to the Websites, to monitor how users navigate
                            the Websites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to
                            count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
                        <p>
                            Cookies - A cookie is a data file placed on a Computer when it is used to visit
                            the Websites. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation,
                            tracking user preferences and web pages visited while using the Websites. You may
                            be able to remove, reject and/or disable some types of cookies using your browser’s
                            preferences or other programs. Some features of the Websites may not function properly
                            or may operate slowly if you disable, delete, or refuse to accept cookies. Some
                            of the cookies we use may be “Flash” cookies. A Flash cookie is a data file placed
                            on a Computer via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded
                            by you to your Computer. While they are harmless, depending on your browser, these
                            cookies may not be deleted when your cookies are deleted or disabled and, in some
                            instances, they may cause your cookies to reappear in your browser. Please check
                            your browser to determine where these types of cookies are stored and how they may
                            be deleted or disabled.</p>
                        <p>
                            Mobile Device Identifiers - Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile
                            devices and we or our third-party service providers may receive such device information
                            if you access the Websites through mobile devices. Certain features of our Websites
                            may require collection of mobile phone numbers, and we may associate that phone
                            number to mobile device identification information. Additionally, some mobile phone
                            service providers operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices
                            that use their service. Depending on the provider, we or our third-party service
                            providers may receive this information.</p>
                        <p>
                            Embedded Scripts - An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect
                            information about your interactions with the Websites, such as the links you click
                            on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Computer from our web server or
                            a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Websites,
                            and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
                        <p>
                            Information collected through passive means may be non-identifying or may be associated
                            with you. In the latter case it will be treated as personally identifiable information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We use non-personal information in a variety of ways, including to help analyze
                            site traffic, understand customer needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional
                            activities and to improve our services. We may use your non-personal information
                            by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from others. We may
                            share your non-personal information with our affiliated companies and third parties
                            to achieve these objectives and others, but remember that aggregate information
                            is anonymous information that does not personally identify you. We may provide our
                            analysis and certain non-personal information to third parties (who may in turn
                            use this information to provide advertisements tailored to your interests), but
                            this will not involve disclosing any of your personally identifiable information.</p>
                        <p>
                            3. Information You Provide About A Third Party If you send someone else a communication
                            from the Websites, such as sending Website content to a friend, the information
                            you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication
                            and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that
                            person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend
                            functionality on our Websites, your e-mail address may be included in the communication
                            sent to your friend
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            4. Information Third Parties Provide About You We also may, from time to time, supplement
                            the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to enhance
                            our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities
                            to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may
                            combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we
                            collect through the Websites. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy
                            to any personal identifiable information received, unless otherwise specifically
                            disclosed by us at the time you provide your personally identifiable information.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            C. OTHER USES</h3>
                        <p>
                            1.E-mail Communications: If you send us an e-mail with questions or comments, we
                            may use your personally identifiable information to respond to your questions or
                            comments, and we may save your questions or comments for future reference. For security
                            reasons, we do not recommend that you send non-public personally identifiable information,
                            such as passwords, social security numbers or bank account information, to us by
                            e-mail. Further, we may send you e-mail under the following circumstances: (a) if
                            you request a particular service or sign up for a feature that involves e-mail communications;
                            (b) if it relates to purchases you have made with us (e.g., product updates, customer
                            support, etc.); (c) if we are sending you information about our other products and
                            services; (d) if you consented to being contacted by e-mail for a particular purpose;
                            (e) if you send us an e-mail, post information on the Websites (i.e., a blog) or
                            otherwise submit information to us electronically, we may e-mail you to follow-up
                            or otherwise communicate with you with respect thereto; (f) to provide you legal
                            notices or notices with respect to your use of the Websites; or (g) to otherwise
                            facilitate a transaction between us. In certain instances, we may provide you with
                            tools on the Websites that will allow you to set your preferences for receiving
                            e-mail communications from us; that is, agree to some communications but not others.
                            You may “opt out” of receiving future commercial e-mail communications from us by
                            clicking the “unsubscribe” link or following the other instructions included at
                            the bottom of most e-mails we send, or as provided below in Section I; provided,
                            however, we reserve the right to send you transactional e-mails such as customer
                            service communications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2.Transfer of Assets: As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase
                            assets. If another entity acquires us or all (or substantially all) of our assets,
                            the personally identifiable information and non-personal information we have about
                            you will be transferred to and used by this acquiring entity, though we will take
                            reasonable steps to ensure that your preferences are followed. Also, if any bankruptcy
                            or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may
                            be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3.Other: Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, we reserve the right to
                            disclose any personally identifiable or non-personal information about you if we
                            are required to do so by law, with respect to notices and counter-notices pursuant
                            to our DMCA notice and takedown policy and procedures and/or if we believe that
                            such action is necessary to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with
                            the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our legal rights
                            or property, our Websites, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the
                            health and safety of our Websites’ users or the general public.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            4.Sweepstakes Contests and Promotions: We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other
                            promotions through the Websites that may require registration. By entering any promotion,
                            you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, which may contain
                            specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing
                            the sponsor(s) of the promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising
                            or marketing associated with the promotion. If you choose to enter a sweepstakes,
                            contest or other promotion, personally identifiable information may be disclosed
                            to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such promotion,
                            including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment,
                            and as required by law or permitted by the promotion’s official rules, such as on
                            a winners list.

                            5.Your California Privacy Rights: (a) Residents of the State of California, under
                            certain provisions of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from
                            companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which
                            the company has disclosed certain personally identifiable information as defined
                            under California law during the preceding year for third party direct marketing
                            purposes. You are limited to one request per calendar year. In your request, please
                            attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California
                            address for our response. You may request the information in writing as provided
                            in Section I.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (b) How We Respond to Browser “Do Not Track” Signals. Some web browsers incorporate
                            a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to Websites that you visit that you do not
                            want to have your online activity tracked. California Business &amp; Professions Code
                            Section 22575(b)(as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California
                            residents are entitled to know how CooksCentral.com responds to “Do Not Track” signals.
                            How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform so a standard
                            technological response has not yet been developed by the policy and technological
                            communities. For this reason, we do not respond to Do Not Track signals currently,
                            and we await the result of work by the policy community and industry to determine
                            when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take. CooksCentral does
                            provide a means for opting out of targeted advertising on our Websites. The effect
                            of an opt-out will be to stop targeted advertising, but it will still allow the
                            collection of usage data for certain purposes (e.g. research, analytics and internal

                            advertisers to serve advertisements on the Websites and may use traffic measurement
                            services to analyze traffic on the Websites. Network advertisers are third parties
                            that display advertisements based on your visits to the Websites and other websites
                            you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to
                            you for products and services in which you might be interested. The Websites’ third
                            party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement
                            services may themselves set and access their own cookies and other technologies
                            on your Computer and track certain behavioral information regarding users of your
                            Computer via a Device Identifier. These third party cookies and other technologies
                            are set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you
                            might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too
                            many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that
                            have been delivered to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page)
                            served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web
                            beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.
                            Third party cookies, web beacons, and other third party technologies are governed
                            by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. <b>While we may use a variety
                                of companies to serve advertisements on the Websites, CooksCentral does provide
                                a means for opting out of targeted advertising on our Websites.</b> You may

                            (“NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these
                            companies, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one
                            or more NAI members only means that those NAI members will no longer be able to
                            deliver targeted content and/or ads to you, which will affect this and other web
                            sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or
                            ads. In addition, opting out may still allow the collection of usage data for certain
                            purposes (e.g., research, analytics and for internal online services operation purposes).
                            Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out
                            page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change
                            web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Additional
                            information is available on the NAI’s web site accessible by the above link.
