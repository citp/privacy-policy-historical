<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better  protect your privacy we provide this policy explaining our online information  practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is  collected and used.

<div class="memberBoxHeader">The  Information We Collect</div>

If you participate, we or our trusted partners  may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation  in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a  choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information  typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and  demographic information (such as zip code). We may use this information as  described in this policy and to improve our sites, monitor site traffic or  personalize the sites. </p>
<ul>

<p>If you choose to use  our referral service to tell a friend about our website, we will ask you for  your friend’s name and contact information.&nbsp;  We will automatically send your friend a one-time communication inviting  him or her to visit CoolSavings.&nbsp; CoolSavings stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time communication  and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>

<div class="memberBoxHeader">Communications from CoolSavings</div>

Out of respect for your privacy, we present the  option not to receive these types of communications.&nbsp; Please see the “Choice/Opt-out” section  below. </p>
<u>Service-Related Announcements and Updates</u>

<div class="memberBoxHeader">Information  Sharing and Disclosure</div>
<p><u>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</u></p>
<p>We share aggregated demographic, performance and  behavioral information about our user base with our partners and  advertisers.&nbsp; This information does not  identify individual users.<br>
  <br>
    <u>Personally identifiable information:</u></p>
<ul>
  <li>We  may share your personal information with other companies so that they can empower  their services, market their products or services to you and supply you with  special offers.&nbsp; We will only share  information that we feel is the minimum required to fulfill those company’s  requirements.&nbsp; If you do not want us to  share your personal information with these companies, please refer to the  Choice/Opt-out section or change your preferences in “My Preferences”. </li>
  <li>We  may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to  help us with our business activities such as a hosting provider or offering  customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal  information <em>only as necessary to provide </em>these services to us </li>
  <li>We  may provide your personal information to specific companies who have their products  and services advertised on the CoolSavings website.&nbsp; For example, we may provide your personal  information to an advertiser if you have taken an action to register for or  request more information from an advertiser on CoolSavings.</li>
  <li>We  may also disclose your personal information </li>
  <ul>
    <li>as  required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process </li>
    <li>when  we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights,  protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a  government request,</li>
    <li>if  CoolSavings is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion  of its assets,&nbsp; you will be notified via  email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or  uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have  regarding your personal information,&nbsp; </li>
    <li>to any other third  party with your prior consent to do so. For example, when registering on the  Community section of the CoolSavings website, your personal information is  shared with NING, who operates the platform for the Community section on behalf  of CoolSavings.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<div class="memberBoxHeader">Choice/Opt-out</div>
<p>We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of  having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, such  as marketing material from us or third party partners.</p>

<p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and  promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the  instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by changing your  preferences in “My Preferences”.</p>

<div class="memberBoxHeader">Our  Commitment to Data Security</div>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy,  and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate  physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the  information we collect online.</p>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow  generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information  submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of  transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%  secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. When you  enter sensitive information (such as regulated and controlled data), we encrypt  the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology  (SSL).</p>

<div class="memberBoxHeader">Access  to Personally Identifiable Information</div>
<p>If your personally identifiable  information changes, you may submit those changes through the My Preferences  section of the website.&nbsp; If you request  deletion of your information previously collected, please note that your  personal information will be suppressed from further use as described in this  policy.&nbsp; However, we will retain  and use your personal information as necessary in order to comply with our corporate  policies, including but not limited to legal obligations, dispute resolution  and enforcement of our agreements. To submit such as request concerning the  personal information we previously collected contact us  <a href="http://reg.coolsavings.com/info.htm?tp=con&amp;promo_name=&amp;catalog_id=14078"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a>. We will respond to your request within 30 days.</p>

<div class="memberBoxHeader">Our  Commitment to Children's Privacy</div>
<p>Protecting the privacy of children  is especially important. For this reason, we never knowingly collect  information from anyone under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that  such information has been collected, that information will be immediately suppressed  from our database.</p>

<div class="memberBoxHeader">Use  of Cookies</div>
<p>Our website use cookies to enhance  and personalize your online experience and to enable our website to recognize  you as a previous visitor. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often  includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a  website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. You can adjust the  settings on your browser to erase or block such technologies from your computer  if you want to, but if you do so, you may experience difficulty using or accessing CoolSavings.</p>

<p>Each website can send its own cookie to your  browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy)  your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent  to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this  whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.  Cookies record information about your online preferences and may be tied to  your personally identifiable information such as your email address for these  purposes. Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all  cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at  any time. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your  browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.</p>

<div class="memberBoxHeader">Web Beacons</div>
<p>We and third parties employ a software technology called Web Beacons that help us  better manage content on our website by informing us what content is  effective.&nbsp; Web Beacons are tiny graphics  with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track  the online movements of Web users.&nbsp; In  contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Web  Beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the  period at the end of this sentence. We may tie the information gathered by  clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information such as their  email address, to enhance and personalize content and your online experience.</p>

<p>We  use Web Beacons in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been  opened by recipients.&nbsp; This allows us to  gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our  marketing campaigns.&nbsp; If you would like  to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice/Opt-out.” </p>

<p>Our website also allows its partners  and advertisers that are presenting advertisements on the CoolSavings website to  set their cookies, or apply Web Beacons or similar technologies, to your  computer. We have no access or control of these third party tracking  technologies. This information may be used to: </p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>provide security;</li>
  <li>authenticate your Login;</li>
  <li>personalize features on the CoolSavings website;</li>
  <li>enable you to participate in certain online activities, such as making sure that each person only votes in an online poll once;</li>
  <li>help measure and research the effectiveness of the CoolSavings website, including collecting statistics on your response to       advertisements, e-mail and other communications you receive;</li>
  <li>remember the preferences and registration data that you give us.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our website and our associated third parties may  also use ad network providers to help present advertisements on the CoolSavings website. These ad network providers may use cookies, or Web Beacons or  similar technologies on your computer to tailor content, advertisements to your  preferences, help target, measure and track your visits and the effectiveness  of advertisements and promotions, using data gathered over time and across  their networks of Web pages to determine or predict the characteristics and  preferences of their audience and to provide security within shopping baskets  or transactions. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies is  subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. If you do not wish to have this information  used by certain ad network providers for the purpose of serving you targeted  ads, you may opt-out by clicking here: <a href="http://preferences.truste.com" target="_blank">http://preferences.truste.com/</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being  served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads. You may find more information at the website of either  the individual third-party ad network, the Network Advertising Initiative  (http://www.networkadvertising.org), Privacy Choice  (http://www.privacychoice.org/choose), and Digital Advertising Alliance  (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).</p>

<div class="memberBoxHeader">Log  Files</div>
<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain  information automatically and store it in log files.&nbsp; This information includes internet protocol  (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit  pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>

<p>We use this information to analyze trends, to  administer the website, to track users’ movements around the website and to  gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>

<p>We may link this automatically-collected data to  personally identifiable information to document your registration IP address,  date and time, detect and investigate malicious activity, as necessary, comply  with our corporate policies, including but not limited to legal obligations, dispute  resolution and enforcement of our agreements and to assist us with enhancing and personalizing content and  your online experience. </p>

<p>We use a third-party  tracking service that uses cookies and clear gifs to track non-personally  identifiable information about visitors to our website in the aggregate to track  usage and volume statistics to improve our website.</p>

<div class="memberBoxHeader">Links  to Other Sites</div>
<p>This website contains links to other websites that  are not owned or controlled by CoolSavings.&nbsp;  Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of  such other websites.</p>

<p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our website  and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects  personally identifiable information.</p>
 
<p>This privacy statement applies only to information  collected by the CoolSavings website.</p>

<p>Our offer pages and other pages on our website  may be powered by third parties that are either acting as a service provider  for us or in some other cases may own and control the data collected (for. Ex. our Community pages).&nbsp; Please view the  privacy statement that links from each page on our website to understand these relationships.</p>

<div class="memberBoxHeader">Changes  in this Privacy Statement</div>
<p>We may update this privacy statement to reflect  changes to our information practices. If we make any material  changes  we will notify you by email or by means of  prominent notice on our website prior to the change becoming effective. We  encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on  our privacy practices.</p>

<div class="memberBoxHeader">How  to Contact Us</div>
<p>Should you have other questions or  concerns about this policy, please <a href="http://reg.coolsavings.com/info.htm?tp=con&amp;promo_name=&amp;catalog_id=14078"><em><strong>contact us</strong></em></a>.</p>

<div class="memberBoxHeader">Special Rights for Residents of  Certain States</div>
<p>If you are a California resident or another  state with specific laws relating to the collection and use of Information, you  may have specific rights not set forth in this policy.
