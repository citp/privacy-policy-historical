#### PERSONAL INFORMATION 

Cool Works® collects personal information from users on a voluntary basis only. This allows us to give you private and secure areas for job seekers and employers to post and edit content on our site. We do not sell your personal information to anyone for any reason. When you voluntarily distribute or display personal information such as your email address or resume, others may be able to collect and use it.
