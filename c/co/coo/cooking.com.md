### Automated Information Collection 

#### Cooking.com Automated Collection 

We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store information whenever you interact with our website through your computer or mobile device. This information, which includes the pages you visit on our site, which web address you came from, the type of browser/device/hardware you are using, , search terms and IP-based geographic location, helps us customize your website experience and make our marketing messages more relevant. This includes content presented on another website or mobile application. These technologies also enable us to provide features such as storage of items in your cart between visits, to improve site design, product assortments, and customer service.

In order to provide the best guest experience possible, we also use these technologies for reporting and analysis purposes, including how you use our website and the performance of our marketing efforts.

#### Third-Party Automated Collection

Cooking.com participates in online behavioral advertising (OBA), also known as interest-based advertising. We use third-party advertising companies to display ads tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online.

We allow third-party companies to collect information when you visit our website and to use that information to serve ads for products or services or for the products or services of other companies when you visit this website or other websites. These companies collect non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, MAC address, cookie and session ID) and personally identifiable information (e.g. IP address) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These parties typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information.

At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but we do provide you the option to opt out of behavioral advertising. To learn more about OBA or to opt-out of this type of advertising, visit the [Network Advertising Initiative website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance website.](http://aboutads.info/)

Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.

You are responsible for the information you choose to submit in these instances.

We also obtain information about you from other third parties. For instance, we obtain information from companies that can enhance our existing guest information to improve the accuracy and add to the information we have about our guests (for example, by adding or updating address information).
