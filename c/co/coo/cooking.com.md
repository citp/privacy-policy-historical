Our pledge to you, our customer  
Cooking.com respects your privacy. Our Internet site is meant to be a service to you. In order to provide you with the best products, timely information and quality customer service, we record a variety of information from your visit to our site. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

Your personal information: what we collect and how we use it

* When you enter personal information in to the Shopping Cart, we collect your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card information. First, we use this information to fulfill your order and to communicate with you about your order. In fulfilling your order, we share your personal information with outside parties to the extent necessary to fulfill your order. In addition, 

a. Your First Use of the Shopping Cart at Cooking.com \- We use the information you provide to: 

  * automatically place you on our e-mail list to receive special offers and updates about products and services, unless you edit your subscription profile at the time your order is placed; and 
  * make lists of our customers' names and postal addresses (but not e-mail addresses or phone numbers) available to pre-screened companies who have specific direct mail (e.g. catalog) product or service offers that we think may be of interest to you. 

b. Your Subsequent Use of the Shopping Cart at Cooking.com \- If you have purchased a product from a Cooking.com company before, unless you edit your subscription profile at the time your order is confirmed, your subscription status will remain unchanged.

Whether you are using the Shopping Cart for the first time or not, if you later decide that you want to be removed from a list or do not want us to share your name and postal address information, simply follow the instructions in the section "Reviewing, Changing Your Information or Unsubscribing" below.

* When you send a gift and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's name and postal address. We use this information only to ship the product and confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to fulfill that order. Information you provide us to create a gift-card is only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving the gift.
* When you subscribe to our e-mail newsletters, we collect your e-mail address so that we can send you our e-mail newsletters with special offers and updates about products and services.
