**Our pledge to you, our customer**  
Cooking.com respects your privacy. Our Internet site is meant to be a service to you. In order to provide you with the best products, timely information and quality customer service, we record a variety of information from your visit to our site.

**Your personal information: what we collect and how we use it**

*  **When you purchase products from Cooking.com** , we collect your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card information. First, we use this information to fulfill your order and to communicate with you about your order. In fulfilling your order, we share your personal information with outside parties to the extent necessary to fulfill your order. In addition,

If you password-protect the guest view of your registry, guests initially see only your names, wedding date and location. They need a password (provided to them by you) to view the items you have registered for.
