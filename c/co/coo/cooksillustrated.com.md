We at Boston Common Press are committed to respecting your privacy and we recognize your need for appropriate protection of personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified, including name, address, e-mail address, or credit card information). For this reason, we have established the following privacy policy, so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your information.

  
To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles, and assure you that we take reasonable steps to see that it is followed within our company: 

  
**INFORMATION/CHOICE**  
There are times when we may collect personal information from you. For example, when you register with Boston Common Press for our online subscription service, electronic newsletter, surveys, or other services, personal information is requested. Your E-mail address is added to our electronic mailing list so that, from time to time, we can send you our cooking newsletter or information about additions and special promotions on Boston Common Press's Web site. We do not sell or share your e-mail address with other companies or third parties other than the following exception: individuals who register for access to the America's Test Kitchen web site at www.americastestkitchen.com may, during their registration process, choose to receive email offers from the sponsors of our public television series. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of Boston Common Press's Web site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services. You may submit the opt out form at any time, and you will no longer receive any electronic communications from Boston Common Press.

 **ACCURACY**  
We do our best to maintain the accuracy of the personal information you supply to us; we are working on tools that will allow you to review and update your information in the future.
