CoolWallpapers reserves the right to prohibit any submission that it deems offensive. Some of the items that can be seen as offensive include any pornographic, racial or hate-based works. By submitting your work to CoolWallpapers, you also agree that you are the legal copyright holder to all said submitted works (or parts-thereof) or that you have permission from the original work's artist. If a submitted piece of artwork is found to not be that of the submitting artist, he/she shall be responsible for any legal action that may arise due to copyright infringement. We do not claim ownership of the artwork submitted to CoolWallpapers as all artwork submitted is the copyrighted work of its original artist. The files submitted by the users of CoolWallpapers are not checked for viruses and it is recommended that all users check their downloaded files with a virus checker. CoolWallpapers takes no responsibility for anything contained in a downloaded file as the contents of each file are not checked by the CoolWallpapers website or it's admins.

As CoolWallpapers is a general-age website, we ask that all registered users behave in an appropriate manner at all times. As stated in the above Submissions Policy, we do not allow the use of offensive material. Do not post material that is pornographic, racial or hate-based. CoolWallpapers reserves the right to cancel a member's account along with all files submitted by that member at any given time without warning. CoolWallpapers also allows its users to remove their submitted artwork at any given time. If a submitted piece of work is found to be not that of it's submitting artist (aka - a rip), then action will be taken to have that piece removed. Repeat offenders will have their accounts cancelled. If you'd like to notify CoolWallpapers of such a submission, please feel free to contact a site admin.
