that you may provide via this site. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy
Policy before using or submitting information to this site.

This site may ask you to submit personally identifiable information in order for

Passive Information Collection
As you navigate through this site, certain anonymous information can be
passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the
information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web
beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream).
Your Internet browser automatically transmits to this site some of this anonymous
information, such as the URL of the Web site you just came from and the Internet
Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently using.
You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse
cookies altogether, but certain features of this site might not work without
cookies.
This site may use such passively collected anonymous information to provide
better service to site visitors, customize the site based on your preferences,
compile and analyze statistics and trends, and otherwise administer and improve
the site for your use.
Use and Disclosure of Information
Except as otherwise stated, we may use information collected via this site to


improve the content of our site, to customize the site to your preferences, to
communicate information to you (if you have requested it), for our marketing and
research purposes, and for any other purpose specified. In addition, we may
make full use of all information acquired through this site that is not in personally
identifiable form.
If you provide personally identifiable information to this site, we may combine
such information with other actively collected information unless we specify
otherwise at the point of collection.
We may disclose personally identifiable information you provide via this site to
other CooperVision, Inc. affiliates worldwide that agree to treat it in accordance
with this Privacy Policy and use it for the same purposes.
We also may disclose personally identifiable information you provide via this site
to third parties that are not CooperVision, Inc. affiliates, but only:(i) to contractors
we use to support our business (such as fulfillment services, technical support,
delivery services, and financial institutions), in which case we will require such
third parties to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and use it
for the same purposes;(ii) in connection with the sale, assignment, or other
transfer of the business of this site to which the information relates, in which case
we will require any such buyer to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy
Policy and use it for the same purposes; or(iii) to respond to law enforcement
requests or where required by applicable laws, court orders, or government
regulations.
The collection, use, and disclosure of information contemplated in this Privacy
Policy may involve a transfer of the information to jurisdictions located outside
your country of residence that may not have equivalent laws and rules regarding
personally identifiable information. In these cases, you will be asked to consent
to such transfers and disclosures in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

current, and complete, please contact us as specified below and we will take
appropriate steps to update or correct such information in our possession, or to

Security
This site takes reasonable steps to protect personally identifiable information as
you transmit it to our site and to protect such information from loss, misuse, and
unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should keep in
