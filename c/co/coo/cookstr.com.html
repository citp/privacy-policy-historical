      <h2>Information Use and Sharing</h2>
      <p>The information that Cookstr collects from the Web Site is used primarily for improving the Web Site and to notify our visitors of updates to the Web Site. The collected information is also used to describe Web Site traffic patterns to vendors and advertisers who are interested in knowing who is viewing their offerings.</p>
      <p>Cookstr, or its affiliates or advertisers, may offer you during your registration on the Web Site, or through future e-mail, the opportunity to receive offers and information about products and services that Cookstr believes may be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive any of these offerings or information, you may opt out from such receipt at any time by following the <a href="#opting_out">“Opting out”</a> procedures listed below.</p>

      <h2>Sharing Information with Third Parties</h2>
      <p>From time to time, Cookstr may work with and provide non-personally identifiable information, such as visitors’ Web Site browsing patterns, and visitors’ names and email addresses, to a variety of vendors and third parties, including ad delivery service providers (e.g. ADTECH), who may be interested in knowing who is viewing ads and offerings.

      <p>Cookstr may also provide visitors’ names and email addresses to a third party service provider with whom Cookstr contracts to profile customer purchasing behavior. This information is used to help Cookstr, its affiliates and advertisers, to improve their offerings. This third party service provider may also supply this information to third parties for a fee.</p>
      <p>In addition to the transfers of personally identifiable information described above, in the event that the Cookstr, LLC business is purchased by a third party, the personally identifiable information possessed or used by Cookstr will be transferred to the purchaser together with all the other assets purchased.</p>

      <h2>Opting Out<a name="opting_out"></a></h2>
      <p>At Cookstr, the choice is in the hands of our visitors. As stated above, you may have your personally or non-personally identifiable information removed from Cookstr's internal distribution to affiliated parties and Cookstr's future distribution to unaffiliated third parties at any time by simply choosing to OPT OUT. You may also OPT OUT:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>if you do not want to receive e-mail commercial advertisements or promotions from us in the future; and/or</li>
        <li>if you are an individual, and want to limit third party companies from marketing their products or services to you based on your personal information that we collect and share with them. This information may include such data as your income, your account history with us, and your credit score.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your choice to limit marketing offers from third parties will apply for at least 5 years from when you tell us your choice unless you tell us to change your choice, in which event your opt-out choice will apply until your notification of such change. Once the 5-year opt-out period expires, you will receive a renewal notice that will allow you to continue to limit marketing offers from third party for at least another 5 years.</p>
      <p>If you have already made a choice to limit marketing offers from third parties, you do not need to act again until you receive the renewal notice.</p>
      <p>In order to OPT OUT for any of these purposes, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@cookstr.com">privacy@cookstr.com</a>.
