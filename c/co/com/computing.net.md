# Privacy Policy

## Our Commitment to Privacy

We respect the privacy of your information. We provide this explanation about our online information practices as a show of our commitment to protect your privacy.

We do not sell or rent or share personally-identifying information collected during your use of our Website without your permission.

We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your personally-identifying information will be shared with a third party. You will always have the option of not permitting the transfer by not using the particular services or not participating in the promotion or contests for which the information is collected or shared.

### The Information We Collect

At the time you register or make posts onto the site, we collect and store your My Computing.Net username, password and optional information, as well as any additional information entered by you when making a post onto the Website. We need this information to publish your forum comments on the Website. We also use this information to customize your experience using our Website.

We may also ask you for personally-identifying information at other times, such as if you enter into a promotion, post a classified ad, communicate with us, or complete a survey. If you opt-in to receive information regarding a promotion, you give us your permission to share your name and e-mail address with the third party offering the promotion.

In addition, we automatically gather general statistical information about our Website and visitors, such as IP addresses, browsers, pages viewed, number of visitors, goods and services purchased, etc. We may match this information with postings that you make onto the Website. This matching is done for the purpose of preventing unwanted, illegal or offensive postings from occurring on the Website.

As part of our service, we use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. Some features of our site may be available only through the use of a cookie. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Generally, we use cookies to remind us who you are and enable us to access your account information so you do not have to re-enter it. In some instances, our retail partners and advertisers appearing at our site may use their own cookies. Preference and options configurations in your browser determine if and how a cookie will be accepted. You can change those configurations on your computer if you desire. By changing your preferences, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified when a cookie is set, or you can reject all cookies. If you do so and cookies are disabled, you may be required to re-enter your information more often and certain features of our site may be unavailable.

If you obtain goods or services provided by one of our retail partners or service providers, we may exchange with the vendor personally-identified information about you for purposes of your transaction.

### The Way We Use Information

We use your personally-identifying information to allow you to make postings onto this Website, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site's content, layout, and services.

We may also use or disclose information to resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our User Agreement. At times, we may review status or activity of multiple users to do so. We may disclose or access information whenever we believe in good faith that the law so requires or if we otherwise consider it necessary to do so to maintain service and improve our products and services.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to manage our Website and to enhance our site based on the usage pattern data we receive.

### Security

We employ reasonable and current security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information.

Your account information and profile are password-protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Our personnel will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your session. This is to help ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place where others may have access to it.

Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online- for example on message board postings, through e-mail or in chat areas-that information can be collected and used by others.

No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secured. As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

### How You Can Update, Correct or Delete Your Information

You can access the information that we collect online and maintain through normal updating methods. To update, correct or delete this information, you can login to your My Computing.Net account.

### Advertising

Our website parcipates in Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) and multi-site advertising systems. Additionally, third-party advertising cookies may also be used on the website for the purpose of tracking and targeting you both on and off the website.

These types of advertising may collect various data about both you and your usage of the website in order to, among other things, better serve more relevant ads, determine which ads to show you in various circumstances, and provide general analytics about your usage patterns both on and off our website.

You may opt-out of various third-party ads shown on our website using the following links: [Digital Advertising Alliance AdChoices Program](http://www.youradchoices.com/), [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and [Google's Advertising Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

### Children Under 13

We have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who access our Website, and so we carry out the same Privacy Policy for individuals of all ages. If a child has provided us with personally-identifying information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the information and opt out of promotional opportunities.

### Third Party Practices

The Privacy Policy of an advertiser or promotional service appearing at our site may differ from ours. We encourage you to read that policy before responding to the offer.

### Changes to Our Policy

Any changes to our Privacy Policy will be communicated through our Website. Information collected before changes are made will be secured according to the previous Privacy Policy.

### Your Consent

By using our Website, you consent to the collection and use of this information in the manner we describe.
