<li>Cross-device linking. If you access the Digital Services from multiple browsers or devices, we, our service providers and third parties may try to establish connections among and link the different browsers and devices you use to access the Digital Services and our content or ads published elsewhere in certain circumstances.&nbsp;This helps us provide you with a seamless experience across the browsers and devices you use and serve you with more relevant content and ads (e.g., so that we don’t show you the same article twice).&nbsp; See our Cookies Policy for information on the steps you can take to limit cross-device linking.</li>

<li><strong>To pursue our legitimate interests.</strong>&nbsp;We process your information to meet our legitimate interests when we use your information to provide you with the Digital Services and related content, products or services, to communicate with you and for our advertising and marketing purposes.&nbsp;For example, our legitimate interests include making improvements to, customising and understanding how you interact with the Digital Services and related content, products or services, and sending you communications about products and services we think may be of interest to you.&nbsp;To accomplish our legitimate interests, we may share your information with our affiliates and subsidiaries, service providers and business partners (including for our advertising and marketing purposes) and in the context of a corporate transaction.&nbsp;We maintain safeguards to protect the information we process to pursue our legitimate interests.</li>
<li><strong>To compl</strong><strong>y with our legal obligations.</strong>&nbsp;We process and share your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations when we use your information to protect our rights or the rights of others and when we share your information with other parties where required by law or as necessary to protect our rights. For example, we are required to collect certain information from you when processing your subscription payment for tax or financial reporting reasons.</li>
<li><strong>With your consent.</strong>&nbsp;We obtain your consent to process your information when we are required to do so by law.&nbsp;In relation to Cookies and Similar Technologies, we obtain your consent as described in our Cookies Policy.&nbsp;If consent is the legal basis on which we process your personal information, you can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the information provided in the 'Contact Us' section below.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>E. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We share the information we obtain with:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Affiliates and Subsidiaries</strong>. We work closely with affiliates and subsidiaries within the Hearst family of companies with whom we share your information as necessary or appropriate to operate the Digital Services.</li>
<li><strong>Service Providers</strong>. In connection with the operation and provision of the Digital Services, Subscription Forms and the fulfilment of orders for our products or services, we engage various third parties to provide services or handle transactions on our behalf, such as payment processing, email distribution, list processing, postal mailing, cloud computing, analytics, digital content or print subscription performance measurement, ad serving, and managing sweepstakes, competitions, promotions or events.&nbsp;These service providers use the information we provide to them as necessary or appropriate for the performance of their services.</li>
<li><strong>Advertisers, Advertising- and Marketing-Related Service Providers and Partners</strong>. We may provide your information to advertisers, advertising agencies, ad networks, ad exchanges, marketing businesses, technology vendors and other entities that create, deliver and assess advertising or marketing campaigns, including interest-based ads.</li>
<li><strong>Social Media Platforms.&nbsp;</strong>If you interact with social media widgets, share content using social media share buttons, or access features of the Digital Services that contain content or features provided by Social Media Platforms, the relevant Social Media Platforms collect information.&nbsp;We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the Social Media Platforms that you engage with to understand their privacy practices, which we do not control.</li>
<li><strong>Business Partners</strong>. In certain circumstances we provide your information to business partners including, without limitation, joint marketing partners, content sponsors or event organizers, for various purposes.&nbsp; For example, we partner with a third party to offer products on a co-branded, co-sponsored or cross-promotional basis that involves the sharing of information.&nbsp;These initiatives take place on the Digital Services or on other media.&nbsp;The participation of a business partner in a particular initiative is communicated to you by the inclusion of the products, services or branding of the relevant business partner.</li>
<li><strong>Other Parties When Required by Law or As Necessary to Protect Our Rights</strong>. We share your information as we believe is necessary or appropriate to protect, enforce, or defend our legal rights, the privacy or safety of our employees, users of the Digital Services or other individuals and entities, or to comply with or enforce applicable industry standards, law or legal process, including responding to court orders, warrants, subpoenas and other requests from public and government authorities.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Transactions</strong>. We may transfer any of the information we have about you to proceed with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party, such as in the event of a merger, acquisition or other disposition, or in connection with a bankruptcy reorganisation, dissolution, or liquidation.</li>
<li><strong>With Your Consent or Otherwise at Your Direction</strong>. In addition, we share your information with third parties when you consent to or request such sharing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because we operate as part of a global business, the recipients referred to above will sometimes be located outside the jurisdiction in which you are located (or in which we provide the Digital Services or Subscription Forms). See the section on 'International Data Transfer' below for more information.</p>
<p><strong>F. YOUR RIGHTS OVER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>In certain circumstances, you have a right to access or object to the use of personal information held about you (including in relation to direct marketing).&nbsp;You can also ask us to rectify, update, erase, restrict or to share your information in a usable format with another company. &nbsp;Such requests are subject to applicable law.</p>
<p>We encourage you to contact us to update or correct your information if it changes or if the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate.</p>
<p>If you would like to discuss or exercise such rights, please contact us using the details provided in the 'Contact Us' section below.&nbsp;We will contact you if we need additional information from you in order to honour your requests.</p>
<p><strong>a. YOUR CHOICES, INCLUDING MARKETING AND INTEREST-BASED ADS OPT-OUTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Direct Marketing Opt-Outs</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Email marketing.</strong>&nbsp;You can opt out of receiving marketing or promotional emails from us or third parties (where you have chosen to receive third party communications or other types of communications from us, as required by law) by clicking on the 'unsubscribe' link contained in such emails.&nbsp;Please keep in mind that if you opt out of receiving marketing or promotional emails, we will still send you transactional emails or other communications relating to your use of the Digital Services (e.g., to confirm your subscription, to inform you of changes to a Digital Service or in response to your password recovery request).</li>
<li><strong>Text message marketing</strong>.&nbsp;If you choose to participate in a text message marketing campaign or promotion offered in connection with a Digital Service, you can opt out of receiving marketing texts from us by following the instructions contained in those messages (e.g., texting the word STOP) or provided to you when you elected to receive text message marketing.</li>
<li><strong>Direct mail.</strong>&nbsp;If you choose to receive postal mail offers in connection with a Digital Service (whenever such choice is required under applicable law), you can request that we stop sending you postal mail offers by notifying us in writing at the relevant address provided in the 'Contact Us' section below.&nbsp; Please indicate in your correspondence the name of the Digital Service or publication to which your request applies.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing by Third Parties.</strong>&nbsp;We provide your contact information to third parties for their own marketing purposes where you have provided us with your consent to do so.&nbsp;If you wish to withdraw your consent for future sharing you can notify us in writing using the relevant address provided in the 'Contact Us' section below.&nbsp;Please indicate in your correspondence the name of the Digital Service or publication to which your request applies.</li>
<li><strong>Co-Branded, Co-Sponsored or Cross-Promotional Offerings with Business Partners</strong>.&nbsp;If you choose to participate in a co-branded, co-sponsored or cross-promotional offering, the brand, sponsor or other third-party business partner involved in that offering may use your information for its own purposes, including advertising and marketing purposes, in line with the business partner’s own privacy policy.&nbsp;You must contact the relevant business partner directly to exercise your opt out choices with respect to the business partner’s use of your information.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Interest-Based Ads Opt-Outs</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your preferences regarding the use of Cookies and Similar Technologies, ads you see on the Digital Services may be interest-based ads.&nbsp;This means that these ads are customised based on the information we and others obtain about you and involve the use of Cookies and Similar Technologies.&nbsp;We describe in our Cookies Policy steps you can take to limit tracking of your activities and the delivery of interest-based ads in browsers and mobile apps you use to access the Digital Services.&nbsp;Please keep in mind that if you opt out of interest-based ads, you will still see ads, but these ads will not be based on your inferred interests.&nbsp;In addition, if you take the steps described in the Cookies Policy, some automated means will still be used to collect information about your interactions with the Digital Services for the other purposes described in this Privacy Notice (e.g., to remember user preferences or enable specific functionality).</p>
<p>The technologies used to deliver ads on websites and mobile apps differ.&nbsp; Please also remember that opt-outs are browser and device-specific.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Choices</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Device Settings.</strong>&nbsp;For relevant Digital Services, you will be able to review and adjust your preferences by updating the settings on your device (e.g., permitting us to collect precise location information).</li>
<li><strong>Push Notifications.&nbsp;</strong>If push notifications for a particular Digital Service are enabled on your device, you can review and update your push notification preferences by adjusting the settings on your device.&nbsp; For example, you can select the relevant app from 'Notifications' (for iOS devices) or 'App notifications' (for Android devices) and turn off alerts accordingly.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>G. HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect information from unauthorised access, use or disclosure.</p>
<p>We will keep your personal information for as long as we have a relationship with you. Once our relationship with you has come to an end, we will retain your personal information for a period of time that enables us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain business records for analysis, understanding market trends and/or audit purposes and to improve our Digital Services.</li>
<li>Comply with record retention requirements under applicable laws or other relevant legal or regulatory requirements.</li>
<li>Defend, establish, exercise or bring any existing or potential legal claims.</li>
<li>Carry out fraud detection and prevention.</li>
<li>Deal with any complaints regarding the Digital Services, our products and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will delete your personal information when it is no longer required for these purposes. If there is any information that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further processing or use of the data.</p>
<p><strong>H. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER</strong></p>
<p>In certain circumstances, your personal information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in countries outside the European Union or United Kingdom that do not have similar data protection laws to the European Union or United Kingdom.</p>
<p>In such circumstances we put appropriate safeguards in place to protect your data, including contractual commitments. &nbsp;For more information on these safeguards, please contact us at the details below.</p>

<p>The Digital Services are not intended for use by children, especially those under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>

<p>Certain Digital Services contain links to websites, mobile apps or other services operated by companies not affiliated with Hearst.&nbsp; In addition, the Digital Services may be made available to you through third-party platforms (such as app stores or Social Media Platforms) or other channels.&nbsp;We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any non-Hearst operated websites, mobile apps or other services and channels, and we encourage you to review the privacy policies or notices published by relevant third parties.</p>
<p><strong>K. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE</strong></p>
<p>We update this Privacy Notice from time to time to reflect changes in our privacy practices or applicable laws.&nbsp;Where changes to this Privacy Notice have a fundamental impact on the nature of the processing or otherwise have a substantial impact on you, we will give you advanced notice so that you have the opportunity to exercise your rights (e.g. to object to the processing). We will publish the updated version on the relevant Digital Services and indicate at the top of the Privacy Notice when it was most recently updated.&nbsp; Your use of the Digital Services will be governed by the then-current version of the Privacy Notice.</p>
