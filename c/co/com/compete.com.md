# Privacy Policy - Compete, Inc.

  


Compete, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Compete, Inc. will not license, publish, or sell any information that can be tied to an individual Internet user that it receives from its data providers. 

Compete offers clients aggregate data concerning online consumer behavior by licensing URL and demographic data (age, gender, household income, geographical location, etc.) from multiple sources including ISPs and browser companions. Compete, Inc. honors the privacy policies of its licensors and does not license personally identifiable information from its licensors. 

Inadvertently, the URLs we license sometimes contain personal information about the Internet users whose behavior our data providers record. For example, when an Internet user enters information on a Web page, the operator of the Web site may insert information into its URL for that or the next page. This information often appears after a question mark in the URL, although it can appear in other places. This means that a name, address, email address, or similar information that an Internet user enters into a Web page sometimes becomes part of the URL that is then transmitted to Compete by its data providers and stored in Compete's databases. This can also occur with words, topics, products, or phrases entered into search engines. Compete has no control over what information third party websites put into their URLs or where they put it. 

However, Compete, Inc. makes no effort to connect this information with any personal information about an individual user and does not analyze personally identifiable information embedded in its licensed data to determine the identity of any Internet user, except as required by subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements. Further, Compete aggregates data on multiple users before supplying data to its clients, thereby ensuring an individual's privacy. 

We would be happy to answer any additional questions you may have or to put you in touch with our Chief Privacy Officer. Please contact [privacy@compete.com](mailto:privacy@compete.com).
