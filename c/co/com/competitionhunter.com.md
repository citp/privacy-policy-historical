Information we may collect from you

Competition Hunter is keen to ensure that the principals of our opt-in when your data is collected are clearly explained. The information you volunteer to Competition Hunter and that DLG holds about you, will be shared and used to appropriately target offers and marketing communication from Competition Hunter, from our clients, from our selected third party partners and from DLG and its other brands. Marketing communication may be through email, mailing, telemarketing and SMS/MMS, depending on which contact channel information you have volunteered. You may also receive marketing calls via automated voice broadcast over the telephone.

Some questions on our Registration Form and our own competitions are specific to our named sponsors, and by expressing a positive interest in their brand or products you are also agreeing to contact from them. By volunteering your phone number you are agreeing to telephone contact by these named sponsors. You may subsequently need to contact these named sponsor brands directly if in the future you decide to opt-out of further communication from these brands.

This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our site, subscribing to our service, entering DLG branded competitions, posting material or requesting further services.
