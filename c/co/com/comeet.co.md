Comeet respects your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Comeet uses data and information provided to Comeet through the Solution or while visiting our site located at ​ **app.comeet.co** (the “ **Site** ​”).

“​ **You** ​” includes:

  * “ **Customers** ”: these are organizations, and employees, personnel or representatives of organizations, which have subscribed to use the Solution including for the purpose of employing candidates;  and
  *  “ **Candidates** ”: these are (a) candidates for employment, who communicate with Customers or transmit information to Customers by means of the Solution or (b) potential candidates for employment whose information is publicly available or obtained by Customers other than by means of the Solution, and input by Customers to the Solution.



​If not otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in the Comeet Terms of Use, which are available ​[here](http://support.comeet.co/terms-of-service/)​ (the “ **Terms** ​”).

In this Privacy Policy, when we use the term “​ **Identifying Information,** ​” we mean information that can be directly associated with a specific individual or entity.  Examples of Identifying Information include, without limitation:

  * name, address, telephone number or e-mail address,
  * information about activities directly linked to an individual, such as the employment or educational history of a specific individual,
  * observations that a Customer may make in respect of a potential employee, including during an interview, or
  * information regarding hiring decisions made by such Customer.



Our Solution is a service tool used by our Customers to manage information about prospective employees and communicate with prospective employees.  Our Customers are solely responsible for ensuring that their use of the Solution complies with applicable laws and does not violate third party rights. We do not control what information our Customers input in the Solution, or how our Customers use your Identifying Information (as defined below) and we are not responsible for such use. If you have a question regarding how a Customer uses your Identifying Information, please contact the relevant Customer. When we receive Identifying Information in connection with potential employment with a specific Customer we _do not_ share such Indentifying Information with other Customers.

We collect some information on behalf of our Customers, and some information for our use, all as described below.

You are not legally required to provide us with Identifying Information.  However, if you do not provide such information you will not be able to register for, transmit information by means of, or otherwise use our Solution.

**How we Protect Information**

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Identifying Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Identifying Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Only authorized employees or authorized subcontractors of Comeet have access to our production infrastructure, and passwords Customers provide us are strictly regulated. We limit access to Customer data to a select few employees [or authorized subcontractors] who need it to provide support and troubleshooting on our Customers’ behalf. Accessing data center information as well as Customer data is done on an as-needed basis or to provide support and maintenance.

**How we Use Information**

Our Solution is a service tool used by our Customers to manage information about prospective employees and communicate with prospective employees. Identifying Information provided to, on behalf of, or in connection with, a specific Customer will be accessed and used by such Customer and its representatives. We allow representatives of Customers to access the Identifying Information which they inputted or which was inputted by Candidates in connection with a position with such Customer.

Our Customers are solely responsible for ensuring that their use of the Solution complies with applicable laws and does not violate third party rights. We do not control how our Customers use your Identifying Information, including by means of the Solution, and we are not responsible for such use. If you have a question regarding how a Customer uses your Identifying Information, please contact the relevant Customer.

When we receive Identifying Information in connection with potential employment with a specific Customer, we _do not_ share such Indentifying Information with other Customers.
