**From you**

Most of the data that we process will be data that we collect from you directly when you request a quote. We will ask you various questions to collect the data we need for the purpose of providing quotes and comparison information. We will not be able to provide a quote unless you answer the mandatory questions. Where questions are optional, we will explain what we need the data for.

**From our insurance partners**

We will also obtain certain personal data about you from the insurance partners on our panel if you take out an insurance policy with them through our Website. This will include information about whether or not you took out a policy with the insurance partner and the type of policy. We use this information to track sales as well as improve our Website, our services and our customer journey. If there are any complaints or queries about your quote or your policy, we and the relevant insurance provider(s) will also exchange information about the complaint or query to ensure it is appropriately investigated and dealt with.

If you make a claim for one of our rewards the insurance partner may also provide us with information including how you purchased your policy and which policy you purchased to help us to verify your claim.

**From our comparison service partners**

We will also obtain some personal data about you from the comparison service partners listed above in relation to the service they provide. For example, they will give us information about what policy or product you purchased and when.

**From your use of the Website and our services**

We also collect data about you based on your actions, for example we collect data about how and when you use the Website, our mobile app or our services so that we can build up a picture of you as a customer. This can include information such as how many quotes you have obtained for insurance, mouse clicks/taps, mouse movements, page scrolling and text entered into forms which we collect through software which monitors how customer use our Website and our app. This helps us to provide you with a good service and to design improvements to our products and services (including changes to our website) but is also used to help us to prevent and detect fraud.

This information may be used by us and/or shared with and used by our partners to aid in the detection of fraud. Where such data is used by a partner, this will be subject to the partner's own privacy policy.

**Our suppliers**

We will sometimes use third parties to process personal information on our behalf. Our partners may do the same when they are processing your personal information for the purposes of providing a quote for comparison. Where third parties process your personal information on our behalf, we will have a contract in place with them placing obligations on them to keep your data secure and only use it for the purposes that we authorise. The third parties that we use may include, for example, IT service providers and market research agencies.

**Where our insurance partners and comparison service partners collect data from**

In order to provide you with a quote for comparison, our insurance partners and/or comparison service partners will exchange information about you with other companies and/or carry out checks with various databases. These checks are standard practice in the insurance and financial services industries. Each of our insurance partners or comparison service partner is a data controller in respect of these checks and we are not responsible for those checks. We have set out below some of the common databases that they may check.

Checks against existing records

Some of our insurance partners may carry out checks against data they already hold on your (or is held by the company whose brand they administer the product for, or members of their group of companies such as data from existing products, account data or loyalty scheme data. They may use this data to help them assess and rate your application for a quote and determine your premiums. They may also pass this data to their insurance underwriters for these purposes where applicable.

DVLA

Where we ask you for your, or any named driver's, driving licence number, we will pass this to our insurance partners who may pass this to the DVLA in order for a search to be carried out to confirm your (or any named driver's) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data.

Undertaking searches using your driving licence number helps insurers check information to prevent fraud and ensure policy premiums are fair. A search with the DVLA will not show on your (or your named driver's) driving licence record.

For details relating to information held about you by the DVLA, please visit **[www.dvla.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency "DVLA.gov")**.

Credit searches

Many of our insurance partners will carry out checks with credit reference agencies when they generate a quote for comparison. These checks may include-

  * checks against publicly available information such as the Electoral Register, County Court Judgments, bankruptcy or repossession information;
  * checks against data relating to your credit history. Credit Reference Agencies share information with other organisations, enabling applications for financial products to be assessed or to assist the tracing of debtors, or to prevent fraud. Our insurance partners may ask Credit Reference Agencies to provide a credit scoring computation. Credit scoring uses a number of factors to work out risks involved in any application. A score is given to each factor and a total score obtained and this together with other factors will be used to assess your application for a quote.



The Credit Reference Agencies will keep a record of the search and you may see this recorded on your credit file. The name of the company that carried out the search will be stated on your credit search and if you have any queries regarding any search that has been carried out you will need to contact the company directly. If you want to check the information that the Credit Reference Agencies hold about you then you can contact them directly. The main credit reference agencies are Call Credit, Experian and Equifax.

Claims and Underwriting Exchange and Other Registers and Databases

Our insurance partners will exchange information with various databases and registers to help them to check information provided, to detect and prevent crime or fraud and to obtain information about your no claims history. These may include the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register, the Hunter Database, the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, the No Claims History Database and any other relevant industry databases or registers. Some insurance providers who offer products designed for students or graduates may also undertake additional checks against higher education sources to verify your student or graduate status.

**Publicly available sources**

We use some open sources of data which are not personal data (such as information about particular geographic areas) and combine this with the personal data that we hold about you (such as your own address). For example, if you request a home insurance quote, we might pre-populate information about your house value from publicly available sources. We will make it clear where we do this and you must check the information to make sure it is correct. This information will be passed to our insurance partners in order to assess insurance risk and provide you with an accurate quote.

**Providing data about other people**

You will sometimes need to provide us with data about other people, for example where you request a quote for a policy which includes another person as a joint policyholder or named driver. You may also obtain quotes on behalf of your family or friends. Where you give us data about someone else, you must make sure that you have made that person aware of this Privacy Policy and that they are happy for you to provide their data. Where this privacy policy refers to "your data" this also includes data about anyone else named on the policy or whose data you provide us with.

_Marketing_

When you provide your details you will be given an opportunity to confirm whether you are happy to receive marketing material from us. If you confirm you are happy to receive this material, we will use your postal address, email address and telephone number to send you marketing materials by post, email, telephone call or SMS. We do not pass your data to other companies for marketing purposes.

If you consent to us contacting you for marketing purposes, we will disclose an anonymised version of your email address (we use a process called hashing to protect your details) to third party social media sites such as Facebook to enable us to display marketing to you via such sites. "Hashing" is similar to encryption and means that we scramble the plain text of your email address to create a unique and irreversible message. This means that the social media sites do not receive a plain text version of your email address. Where we do this, we require social media providers only to use your information for the purposes of enabling us to display marketing to you through their site and not for any of their own purposes.

You can change your mind at any time by logging into your account and updating your preferences. You can also unsubscribe from emails by clicking on the unsubscribe link on any marketing emails that we send you, updating your preferences in your account or by unsubscribing on our [**website**](https://preferences.comparethemarket.com/ "Contact preference centre").

This will not impact any communications that we need to send you for the purpose of your quote, for example confirmation of your quote or your account details, notifications we need to send you regarding any rewards you have claimed or communications necessary for any other services you have requested that we provide to you.

Your personal data will also be used to assist us and our approved advertising providers with our advertising activities, as set out in more detail in the "Targeting Cookies" section of our **[Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/information/privacy-policy/privacy-policy-use-of-cookies/ "Cookie policy")**. Targeting cookies do not collect information that is directly identifiable to you, such as your name, email address and information you enter into forms on our website. They collect information about your browsing activity and your device to enable our providers to serve our advertising to you. Most of these cookies are set by our providers who will be responsible for how the cookies (and information collected by them) are used.

However, we do use the personal data that we hold about you to put you into "segments" based on your interests and needs so that we can ensure the advertising you see is relevant to you. To do this effectively, we need to share some of your information with some of our providers so that they can combine it with the information collected by their cookies and serve advertising to audiences that we select. The information shared is limited to your email address, IP address, information about which products you may be interested in such as which pages of our website or app you have visited or which of our emails you have clicked on and whether you have purchased a policy or claimed a reward with us. Information is always shared in an encrypted, non-identifiable form. Where we do this, we will be jointly responsible with the relevant provider for how that personal data is used. More information about our providers and the cookies used, including how to opt out, is set out in our **[Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/information/privacy-policy/privacy-policy-use-of-cookies/ "Cookie policy")**.

_Market Research_

From time to time we may want to use your postal address, email address and/or telephone number to contact you to assist us with our research by asking you a few questions about the service you have received or by asking if you would like to complete a review of our services. We may sometimes ask market research companies to contact you on our behalf.

If you would prefer us not to contact you for market research purposes then you can let us know by contacting us at **[data.request@comparethemarket.com](mailto:data.request@comparethemarket.com)** or by updating your preferences in your account.

_Research and Analysis Activities_

We and our partners use data relating to your quotes, including the personal data you input to request your quotes and information about the policies or contracts you have taken out, to carry out various research and analysis activities to help us to regularly review and improve the products and services we or our partners provide and carry out research. We also share this data with our insurance providers and comparison service providers to enable them to use this data for these purposes. Where possible, data will be shared on an anonymised basis. The data will not be used to make any decisions that will affect you or any other individual and we require our partners and comparison service providers to delete the data as soon as the relevant research and analysis activity is concluded.

We also use the data that we collect about you through your Website usage to carry out research and analysis into usage and activities on our Website to enable us to continue to improve our Website and our products and services.

In relation to personal data used for the purposes described in this Part 4, we process this data because we have a legitimate business interest in carrying out these activities to promote and improve our business. We have ensured appropriate safeguards to protect your rights when processing this data for these purposes.

**Part 5 – Special Categories of Personal Data and Criminal Convictions**

In order to provide your quotes we may ask you to provide data which data protection law classifies as "special personal data". This includes information about your health (such as any medical conditions). We may also need you to provide information relating to criminal convictions or alleged or actual criminal offences, for example traffic offences, in order to provide your quotes. We will also need to share this data with our insurance partners to enable them to generate their quotes for you.

Where we collect special personal data and criminal conviction or offence data for the purposes above, we process this data because it is in the substantial public interest to do so for the purposes of arranging and/or advising on contracts of insurance.

  * information about your use of the App, such as whether you have used your 2 for 1 codes, what movie trailers you have watched on the App, and which restaurants or movies you have searched for; and information about your device, such as your IP address, device profile and device settings (for example, whether you have switched push messaging on or off in your device settings).
  * We will use the data set out above to validate your eligibility to participate in our reward schemes and to administer the schemes. We will also use this data to contact you in relation to our reward schemes and to deal with any complaints or queries you have in relation to the rewards schemes. We will exchange data with our partners where necessary for the administration of any rewards schemes. We will also receive some data from the app about how you have use the reward scheme, for example if you use Meerkat Meals, we will receive information about your use your reward such as when and where you have used your reward and the number of people you used the reward for. This allows us to monitor how customers are using the rewards and to help us make any changes/improvements to our rewards schemes.

We use your personal data in the following ways and for the following purposes:

  * Your name, email and password are used to log you into the App and to link you to your comparethemarket.com account to check your eligibility for Rewards and that your membership is valid and has not expired.
  * Your name is also used to personalise any messages that we send to you through the App.
  * If you have agreed to receive messages from us, we will either use your device information to send you push messages (where you have opted in specifically to receiving push messages), or we will send in-app messages to you, for example to ask you to review the App.
  * If you have agreed to receive marketing from us we will use your device information to notify you of information, products or services that we think may be of interest to you based on your previous use of the App, such as the release of a new film or a change in the participating restaurants for Meerkat Meals.

### How long do we keep data?

We'll only keep your personal data as long as we need it and ensure it is securely destroyed when it is no longer required. We do however need to keep certain data after we have provided you with your quotes for certain periods as detailed below.

Generally, you can expect us to keep your data for a period of 5 years from when you obtain your quote. If you have an account with us we will keep your data while your account with us is active and then if you stop using your account we will generally retain your data for a period of 5 years from that point (unless there is a requirement for us to keep the data for longer, for example if there are any ongoing queries or claims relating to your quotes).

We keep data for these periods as it plays an important part in allowing us to undertake fraud detection and prevention activities, allows us to deal with any queries or complaints that may arise regarding quotes that have been provided and allow us to carry out research and analysis to help us improve our products and services (as described in the section headed "What do we use your data for?" above).

Any of our partners who process your data to provide a quote should only keep the data for as long as is necessary in relation to the quote they have provided. If you take out a policy with one of our insurance partners, that partner will keep your personal data in line with its own retention periods and you should check that insurance partner's Privacy Policy for further information.

If you use the 'Your Documents' facility we will keep your documents for a period of 5 years from the date you last used the account as described above.

### Overseas Transfer of Data

We use third party suppliers to process limited personal data about you. Some of these suppliers may be located in countries outside the UK which may not have equivalent laws in place to protect your personal data. For example, we use third party software suppliers such as Microsoft to process data such as your IP address and email address, which Microsoft stores in the USA.

Whenever we do use third party suppliers to process personal data about you outside the UK, we will ensure that your personal data is kept securely, is only used for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and is afforded equivalent protection as it would be if it were processed in the UK. We do this through various mechanisms, for example making sure that European Commission approved contractual clauses are in place with the supplier or ensuring that suppliers who process personal data in the USA are signed up to the Privacy Shield arrangement. If you are concerned about our use of third party suppliers to process personal data outside the UK, or if you would like any further information about any of these suppliers, please contact us using the details set out under "Contacting us" below.

Our insurance providers and comparison service providers may also process personal data in countries outside the UK which may not have equivalent laws in place to protect your personal data.
