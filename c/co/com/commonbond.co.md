Welcome to CommonBond. This Privacy Statement describes how CommonBond collects and shares information from our website, located at [http://commonbond.co/](https://web.archive.org/).

### How Does CommonBond Work?

CommonBond does not issue loans directly to students.

CommonBond purchases approved loans from our partner bank on behalf of our investors.
