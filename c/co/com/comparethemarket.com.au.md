PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Personal Information
The type of information we collect about you will depend on the circumstances, but will generally include
information which is relevant to the quoting or supply of products or services you’re comparing or enquiring
about. Where practicable, we will always allow you to deal with us anonymously or by using a pseudonym. We
may collect personal information from you to provide you with a comparison service or to allow a supplier
who participates in our comparison service, or a business partner who assists us in providing our comparison
service, to contact you. In some cases, if you do not provide the information we will not be able to provide our
services to you.
Depending on the type of product you’re enquiring about, the information that we collect may include (but is not
necessarily limited to) your name, address, date of birth, gender, insurance history, employment information,
marital status, proof of identification information (e.g. driver’s licence, passport details), bank account details,
social security information, Medicare number, details about the risk you want to insure, details regarding your
financial circumstances (e.g. existing home loans and savings) and future requirements, details about your
property values, and your contact details. If you win a competition that we (or our agents) run, we may also
with your consent use your name, image (e.g. photograph) and/or voice recordings for the purpose of
promoting or marketing the competition and/or our services.
Sensitive Information
If you wish to compare certain products (such as health insurance or life insurance), we may also, where
necessary, collect sensitive information from you. Sensitive information includes any information about your
racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, membership of a political association, religious beliefs or affiliations,
philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or trade association, membership of a trade union, sexual
preferences or practices, criminal record or health information. Currently, we may collect information about
your trade or profession, your health fund memberships, and certain other health information, in order to
provide our service for certain products.
HOW WE COLLECT AND HOLD PERSONAL INFORMATION
We generally only collect your personal information from you directly via the internet, including our websites
and social media, and our call centres. Sometimes, we may collect your personal information from one of our
participating suppliers (for example, if you purchase a product from our of our participating suppliers after
using the websites, that supplier may provide us with information about you) and service providers (for
example, if we engage a marketing research firm to carry out audience testing, that research firm may provide
us with information about you). We may also collect information from another person (e.g. the person
arranging the policy of insurance for customers covered under a family or couples policy health policies), or if
you enquire about home loans , we may also collect personal information you provide to the mortgage broker
we refer you to or from our credit licensee. If we collect information about you from a third party, we will
determine whether we could have lawfully collected that information directly from you and, if not, we will
destroy or de-identify that information (provided it’s lawful to do so).


Any personal information that you provide for a comparison (other than compulsory third party insurance) or
to purchase products or services on the websites or through the call centre is collected and managed by
CTM. Personal information that you provide to purchase products or services on third party websites which
are linked to by us is collected and managed by those third parties (see our Website Terms and Conditions,
available on the websites, for more information about those third party websites).
Information for a compulsory third party insurance comparison is collected and managed by the relevant
State or Territory authority in accordance with their privacy policy. The State and Territory authorities do not
provide your Personal Information to CTM.
If you enquire about home loans, personal information you provide may also be collected by our credit
licensee, Australian Finance Group Limited, and the mortgage broker/s we refer you to assist with your
enquiry. Those parties will collect and manage that information in accordance with their privacy policies.
CTM collects feedback from users of the websites. We will give you the option to provide that feedback
anonymously however, you can provide your personal information with your feedback if you choose.
From time to time, we may use data collection devices such as 'cookies' in conjunction with the websites. We
may (or our marketing company may) evaluate any cookie information collected to measure the effectiveness
of its advertising and how visitors use the websites in order to:
       provide you with a better and more customised service and a more effective website;
       collect information on how many visitors the websites receive, how those visitors use the
         websites, where they came from and where they go; and
       determine whether you have made purchases of certain products elsewhere, after using the
         websites.

using browser web storage and data caches.

centres.

required or permitted by law), we are able to deny access to some or all of the personal information we hold.

to your personal information, but we will advise you of the fee before we process your request. We will
always respond to requests for access and/or corrections within a reasonable period and we will give access
in the manner requested if it is reasonable and practicable to do so. Please email or write to our Privacy

person is entitled to access the information we hold; and he or she should refer to this document to
understand how we manage their personal information.
