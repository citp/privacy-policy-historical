 2005 CCH TAX AND ACCOUNTING - COMPLETETAX PRIVACY POLICY  
---  
   
Our Commitment to Privacy

We are committed to keeping your information private and recognize the importance all customers place on the privacy and confidentiality of their information. While new technologies allow us to more efficiently serve our clients, we are committed to maintaining the rigorous privacy standards that are synonymous with our established and trusted name.

By participating in the Council of Better Business Bureau's BBBOnLine® Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the program's strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have it verified by BBBOnLine®. Further information about this program is available at [http://www.bbbonline.org](http://www.bbbonline.org/).

In keeping with our privacy policy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available throughout our web site as well as on our tax screens within the tax program.  
  
Covered Web Sites

The privacy policy described herein is applicable to this entire web site, including all areas where financial information is gathered and income tax data is input, printed and/or transmitted. It does not apply to any other online services, or to any other web sites published and/or maintained by us.

This privacy notice covers all the online information practices of www.completetax.com. Other sites maintained by CCH Tax and Accounting, such as tax.cchgroup.com and tax.cchgroup.com/pfx/products/CompleteTaxPro/ operate under their own privacy and security policies.

Third party web sites such as www.tvalue.com, www.cj.com, www.refundsnow.com and www.officialpayments.com operate under their own privacy and security policies.  
  
Our Commitment to Data Security 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.  
  
Internal Controls

When collecting, storing and retrieving your personal data, extensive internal controls are maintained throughout the process to ensure security and confidentiality.

Our Internet-based systems are protected behind firewalls, and all mission critical servers are deployed in a cluster environment to provide an even greater level of security and protection against system failure. All data is maintained and backed-up on a regular schedule to provide adequate redundancy and ensure that the integrity of information is never jeopardized.

Our employees are subject to strict guidelines regarding confidentiality, and internal access to customer data is restricted to highly trained personnel on an "as-needed" basis. Information you provide to us is used strictly for lawful purposes and is never shared with federal, state or other taxing authorities without your consent, except as required by law.  
  
Transmitting Information

When transmitting information between you and our server, as well as when communicating with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for electronic filing, data security is handled through a protocol called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL is an established and mature Internet security standard with two dominant features: web server authentication and data encryption.

  * Data Encryption

Data encryption is the process of transforming legible information into a complex arrangement of illegible information. SSL uses a private/public key combination to encrypt data when it is sent and to decrypt data when it is received. SSL encrypts data using a mathematical formula, also referred to as a "key."

Encryption strength is measured by the length of the key used to encrypt the data; the longer the key, the more effective the encryption. Using the SSL protocol, data transmission between you and our web server is performed at a standard level of encryption strength.

  * Web Server Authentication

An SSL certificate is issued to ensure authentic and accurate identification of a secured web server. This translates into a digital ID, an electronic fingerprint, which is included in the key used to encrypt the data. Only our web server, in this case, is able to decrypt the data that you transmit because it is the intended (and digitally certified) secured web server for this data transmission.

The Way We Use Information 

As previously stated, the tax return information that we collect is used strictly for lawful purposes and is never shared with federal, state or other taxing authorities without your consent, except as required by law. If you choose to electronically file your return, we will transmit your tax return to the appropriate federal and state taxing authorities.

The IRS requires us to provide the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from which the return originated, as well as the e-mail address of the person who electronically filed the return. This information is sent to the IRS at the time you choose to submit your return to the IRS for electronic filing.

In order to electronically file your return, we must share your submitted tax information with the appropriate tax authorities in order to complete your request. You can control whether or not you wish your tax information shared for this purpose by deciding whether or not to complete the tax returns forms, which are all clearly labeled.

The above listed credit card information that we collect will be used strictly for order processing and billing purposes, and will not be shared with any other party. When appropriate, bank account or credit card information is also passed to our bank, for processing purposes, if you choose to use our Quick Refund (ARD), Credit Card Payment of Balance Due or Deduct Fee From Refund options. You will enter this information during the routine course of a purchase. In the event that our Internet Service staff should need to research and resolve any status or billing issues associated with an order, the information will only be accessed by authorized personnel.

Our Basic Service entitles you to notification via e-mail of filing deadlines, estimate reminders, tax law changes, as well as tax planning and financial information that may affect your tax return. In order for us to provide you with the Basic Service, it is required that you provide us with your e-mail address and consent to our limited review of your tax return information with our proprietary software program to determine whether your tax return information would trigger such notifications.

In addition to our Basic Service, we may send to you, via your e-mail address, information and promotional messages about other products and services that we think may be of interest to you.

Personally identifiable information is only shared as indicated in this document. Any sharing of such information is subject to the opt-out option as discussed in the paragraph below.  
  
Consent to Use Information

Your use of this service means that you consent to our limited access and review of your tax return information necessary to provide you with the Basic Service described above.

If you wish to opt-out of receiving such information and promotional messages, you may check the box relating to promotional messages located in the User Agreement. The User Agreement is displayed when you start a new return. You can update this option at any time from the User Agreement link, which can be accessed on each page where income tax data is entered. To opt-in or opt-out, click on the User Agreement on any page inside the program, and then go to Section 10, Information Disclosure. There you can click on the check box that states, "Check this box if you do not want to receive our promotional information as indicated above."

Declining to receive e-mail promotional messages will not affect our ability to deliver our Basic Service to you.  
  
Third Party Services 

For the purpose of providing you with additional information or services, our web site may also provide links or references to our other web sites or to third party web sites of online information providers, advertisers, and other business partners. When offering partner services the partner who will be receiving your information will be clearly identified.

We are not responsible for information gathered by third party web sites. You should review any third party site's privacy policy for details regarding their policies concerning information they gather. Any time you are preparing to navigate to a site that is not covered by this privacy notice, we will indicate at the bottom of the page that you are leaving our site.

Through our partnership with Refunds Now®, you may apply for a Quick Refund (ARD). When you apply for a refund anticipation loan, you authorize us to disclose your relevant personal and tax return information to Refunds Now. Your indication within the program that you wish to apply for a Quick Refund serves as your authorization. Information is only sent to Refunds Now after your return has been e-filed. When you select the option within our program for a Quick Refund, once your return has qualified for electronic filing we share your name, address, social security number, phone number and other tax related information necessary for Republic Bank to provide the requested service. Republic Bank uses the personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing your Quick Refund. You may visit the site at [www.refundsnow.com](https://www.refundsnow.com/privacy_policy.asp) to view their privacy policy.

Through our partnership with Official Payments Corporation®, you may request to pay your balance due via credit or debit card. When you make this request, you authorize us to disclose your relevant credit card and tax return information to Official Payments Corporation. When you select the option within our program to pay your balance due via credit or debit card, and your return has qualified for electronic filing, we then share your name, address, social security number, phone number and other tax related information necessary for Official Payments Corporation to provide the requested service. In addition, you will be asked to disclose your card information to Official Payments. Official Payments uses the personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing the payment of your tax via credit or debit card as requested. You may visit the site at [www.officialpayments.com](http://www.officialpayments.com/cch.jsp) to view their privacy policy.

Information entered into the Tax Calculators (through Time Value Software) is used solely to provide you with estimates of various tax situations. The information used in these calculations is not saved. You may visit the site at [www.tvalue.com](http://www.tvalue.com/).

Through our partnership with Tax9er, you may request to file an extension form electronically.

Co-Branded Sites

In certain instances we license our content, technology, software applications, hosting services and support services to partners under a co-brand arrangement. Our co-branded sites will display both the CompleteTax logo and our partner's identification. We provide these co-branded licensees full information regarding our privacy policy and require that the licensee abide by this policy as a part of our contractual terms.

Your name and e-mail address will be available to our co-brand partner so that they may send information and promotional messages about other products and services that may be of interest to you.

If you wish to opt-out of receiving such information and promotional messages, you may check the box relating to promotional messages located in the User Agreement. The User Agreement is displayed when you start a new return. You can update this option at any time from the User Agreement link, which can be accessed on each page where income tax data is entered. Even if you initially chose to receive promotional messages you may opt out by re-entering your return and clicking on the User Agreement at the bottom of any screen. Simply check the box in section 10 of the User Agreement. If you choose to opt-out, your name and e-mail address will not be made available to our co-brand partner. Declining to receive e-mail promotional messages will not affect our ability to deliver our Basic Service to you.  
  
Retrieving Your Information

Our Internet tax service is available for beginning, completing and e-filing your return from approximately mid-January through mid-October of each tax year. To view your return information, you may use your User ID and Password to access a free summary report and/or pay a fee to print, view, and electronically file your actual return. Once you have paid, you may continue to access or modify your tax return as often as needed during this time.

From mid-October through mid-December you can still complete and mail your return to the appropriate filing authorities if you began it prior to mid-October. Simply click on the "Continue Your 2004 Return" selection on the "Prepare Your Return" menu.

After paying for your return, the financial information used to make your payment (e.g. credit card number), as well as the record of your payment, will not be retrievable by you.
