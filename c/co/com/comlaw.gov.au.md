## Privacy Statement

* * *

The Attorney-General's Department is subject to the [_Privacy Act 1988_](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw/management.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200401860?OpenDocument) which requires that we comply with the [Information Privacy Principles](http://www.privacy.gov.au/publications/ipps.html) (IPPs) set out in the Act. The IPPs set out how Australian Government agencies should collect, use, store and disclose personal information and how individuals can access records containing their personal information.

The personal information handling practices of the Attorney-General’s Department are detailed in the annual [Personal Information Digest](http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/rwpattach.nsf/VAP/\(878CAEAF8D7CA41B4CD31727CCC28450\)~Attorney-General_s+Department+PID+2006x.pdf/$file/Attorney-General_s+Department+PID+2006x.pdf). This sets out the kind of personal information collected or held by the Department, what it is used for, to whom it is disclosed and how access to the information can be arranged. 

General enquiries about the Department's compliance with the IPPs can be made to the Department's Privacy Contact Officer. Any complaints about the Department's personal information handling practices can be made to the Privacy Contact Officer or to the Privacy Commissioner. The Privacy Contact Officer can be contacted on (02) 6250 6211 or by writing to the Department.

General information about the Privacy Act and IPPs can be found on the [Office of the Privacy Commissioner's website](http://www.privacy.gov.au/).
