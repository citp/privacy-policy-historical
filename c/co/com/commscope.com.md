**CommScope Website Privacy Statement**  
Welcome to Commscope.com. This Web site (the "Site") is owned and operated by CommScope, Inc., located at 1100 CommScope Place SE, Hickory, North Carolina 28602, USA. CommScope respects your personal privacy and the sensitivity of your Personal Information. This privacy statement ("Privacy Statement") explains how we collect, use, and disclose the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we obtain through this Site.

   **Consent**  
Your use and provision of Personal Information to Site constitute your express consent to the processing and transfer of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Statement. In addition, if you are located in a country other than the United States, your use and provision of Personal Information to the Site constitutes your express consent to the transfer of your Personal Information to CommScope, Inc. and other CommScope affiliates and subsidiaries in the United States and other countries as required by CommScope. Such countries may not provide a level of data protection to your Personal Information equivalent to that provided by your home country. In addition, CommScope does not normally collect "sensitive" Personal Information on this Site, such as information about ethnic or racial origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, and/or health or medical conditions. However, if you do provide such information to CommScope, doing so constitutes your explicit consent to the collection, use, disclosure and transfer of such information for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.

 **Types and Uses of Personal Information**  
CommScope may collect and use the following types of Personal Information about users of the Site:

CommScope uses your Personal Information in order to provide the highest level of customer service to our prospects, customers, investors and users in general. Personal Information is collected in order to allow CommScope to contact you, provide materials to you upon your request, register you, allow you access proprietary systems, to maintain and secure this Site and the CommScope Social Networks, and for similar purposes. At times, CommScope may use Personal Information obtained in order to update a user on information relating to CommScope products or services; although, we will provide you with the right to opt-out of receiving such information. CommScope will not use your Personal Information in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first obtaining your permission.

 **Cookies and Other Passive Tracking Devices**  
CommScope utilizes cookies and similar types of passive tracking mechanisms to generate aggregate and anonymous statistics about the Site, to tailor the content of the Site to make it more effective, and to direct targeted information to users regarding our products and services in which they may have interest. In some cases users of the website will be affirmatively notified and given the choice to opt out before a cookie is sent. In addition, users may configure their Internet browser to notify them whenever a cookie is sent (giving the user the option to decide whether to accept it or not), and to reject or remove all cookies. Certain features of the Site may not be available, however, if a user does not consent to use of a cookie or if cookies are later disabled. To disable cookies, users should consult their browser's help section for instructions. CommScope may combine the information it collects passively with any Personal Information about you.

 **Disclosure of Personal Information**  
We may engage third parties to perform services in connection with the operation of this Site and our organization. Examples of these services may include website hosting, the provision of technology related services, and targeted marketing programs relating to our products and services. We may provide Personal Information to these third parties, but we authorize them to use this Personal Information only in connection with the services they perform on our behalf. In addition, such parties are bound by contract to establish reasonable measures to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.

We may also disclose your Personal Information to protect our rights or property, to enforce our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/Docs/Terms-and-Conditions-for-the-Use-of-the-Website.pdf " Terms and Conditions of Use") and other legal notices, as required or permitted by law, or at the request of government regulators or other law enforcement officials and the courts. Finally, CommScope may share or transfer Personal Information in connection with a prospective or actual sale, merger, transfer or other reorganization of all or parts of its business.

 **Security**  
CommScope maintains appropriate technical, physical and administrative steps to protect the security of your Personal Information. Access to Personal Information is limited only to those employees, contractors or authorized agents of CommScope who have authorization to access such Personal Information and such access is limited to the extent such information is needed to fulfill the task for which the Personal Information was collected. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit. We recommend you to take every precaution in protecting your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. For example, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser.

 **Children's Privacy**  
CommScope does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13, and users under the age of 13 should not submit any Personal Information to CommScope.

 **Safe Harbor for EU Personal Information about CommScope Employees**  
CommScope, Inc. and other CommScope affiliates and subsidiaries in the United States ("CommScope US") recognize that the European Union (“EU”) has an “omnibus” data protection regime established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) (the “Directive”). Among other things, the Directive generally requires “adequate protection” for the transfer of certain personally identifiable data about individuals in the EU (“EU Personal Information”) to CommScope operations in the United States. CommScope US accordingly adheres to the requirements of the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the US Department of Commerce (“Safe Harbor”) with respect to certain EU Personal Information received in the United States from its employees in the EU. CommScope US provides its employees in the EU with information regarding the data transfers that are covered by Safe Harbor via separate policies and procedures. Any employee in the EU that cannot resolve his or her issue directly with CommScope is permitted to contact his or her local data protection authority for further assistance and information. EU Employees may direct questions, comments or access requests for CommScope US to the CommScope Safe Harbor Privacy Contact at [privacycontact@commscope.com](mailto:privacycontact@commscope.com?subject=Request%20from%20Website "Request from Website").
