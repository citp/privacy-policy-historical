## The data we collect

When you visit the GrapeCity website ([www.grapecity.com]()) you have the opportunity to download a trial of our software and/or create an account (a one-time process), through which process you provide us with information that identifies you when you return. From the time that you create an account, we are the ‘Controller’ of the personal data you provide to us. In this process, we only collect basic personal data about you that includes some or all of your name, organization, job title, address, email address, IP address, telephone number, contact history, order history, information selection choices, and product usage information from GrapeCity and/or our Technology Partners. It also includes information you provide to us (whether requested by us or not) in emails, on the telephone, in voicemails and in computer chats, and a record of sign-ins to your GrapeCity account.

If you choose not to create an account or download a trial version of our software, we will not have collected any of your personal data, but you will still be able to use many of the information features of our website that do not require registration.

## Why we collect this information

We collect your basic personal data so that we can better operate our business systems, to ensure a better user experience when you interact with us, and to gain the ability to provide you with better product and business information. We do not collect any personal data from you that we do not need, and we keep all personal data collected confidential. Additionally, through our registration process, we will seek your permission first for the right to use any of your personal data, such as for email communications, marketing, or delivery of complimentary promotional items.

Registration provides unlimited access to our website, and when you sign in to your GrapeCity account, you can amend your personal details, enjoy an efficient user experience on our website, access product information and request trials, create your own quotations, establish payment mechanisms, receive product upgrades, information on new releases, product selection assistance, receive special offers, and enable other features designed to further improve your experience.

We are the developers/publishers of the software products that we sell. When you purchase software products, your name, organization, street address, and email address are registered with us in order to identify you as a legitimate licensee. This also ensures that you receive the latest software product version to download and install, and in addition, that you receive, or are offered, the latest software updates, maintenance and support.

## How we use the data collected

All the personal data processing do is carried out by our employees or by third parties contracted by us for this purpose. All such third parties are contractually obligated by us to adhere to the principles embodied in this privacy statement.

We use your personal data to communicate with you about your account, product updates and information, to improve your user experience, and other related reasons.

GrapeCity has a Data Protection Officer in place to oversee the effective, secure, and confidential processing of your personal data. To request more information about our Data Protection Process, please contact our Data Protection Officer at [us.dpo@grapecity.com](mailto:us.dpo@grapecity.com).

If you have created an account or download a trial of our software, you can amend or update your preferences on your GrapeCity Account [here](https://web.archive.org/my-account).

## How long we keep your data

We are required by tax law to keep your basic personal data (name, address, contact details) for a minimum of 7 years following your most recent purchase, after which time you may request that it be destroyed. However, if you have purchased any perpetual product licenses, your personal data will be kept indefinitely. Our licensing records and certain identification metadata used by our anti-fraud systems will also be maintained indefinitely.

## Additional data usage

We would also like to use your name and email address to inform you of future offers, product developments, and new products we think may be of interest to you based on your previous enquiries and orders. This information is not shared with third parties and you can unsubscribe at any time via phone, email or our website.
