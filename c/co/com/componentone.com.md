## Policies

To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:

## Notice

GrapeCity collects Personal Information on this website in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. If you order a product, for example, the information is used to register your license and rights, if any, to ensure your eligibility to receive technical support, upgrade discounts, or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. If you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. GrapeCity also uses information that you provide as part of our effort to keep you informed about the status of your subscription, product upgrades, special offers, and other GrapeCity products and services.

We will only collect Personal Information where it is relevant for the purposes for which we are collecting it. We will not process any Personal Information for any purposes that are incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by you.

We have also implemented into our website and shopping cart Google® Analytics Advertisement features that allow us to deploy analysis tools provided by Google Analytics; more specifically the “Remarketing” tool. Remarketing with Google Analytics allows us to follow up with people who have already visited our website, and deliver ad content specifically targeted to the interests they expressed during those previous visits. The full details of the Remarketing tool of Google Analytics may be found at: [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2611268.](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2611268)

Occasionally, GrapeCity allows access to database information to bonded mailing houses only for the purpose of allowing for the printing of mailing labels that are used for GrapeCity's own direct mail and promotional purposes. In those instances, the third party is strictly bound by these terms.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby agree that GrapeCity may assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party, your name, address, email address, member name, and any other personal information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of a material portion or essentially all of the assets or stock of GrapeCity or its affiliated entities.
