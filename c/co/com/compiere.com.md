For each visitor to our websites, our web server may automatically recognize and store information, such as the visitor's IP address/domain name combination; the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through and from our websites (including date and time); products you viewed or searched for; page response times; download errors; length of visits to certain pages and page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs).

When you visit our websites, or advertisements appearing on it, or use one or more of our website services, we may use "cookies". A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer if you agree. Our websites use cookies to distinguish you from other users of our websites and contain information to customize your experience, better match your interests and preferences, or to simply facilitate signing in to use our services. By continuing to browse our websites, you are agreeing to our use of cookies. We use the following cookies:

  * Strictly necessary cookies. These are cookies that are required for the operation of our websites. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into any secure areas of our websites.   

  * Analytical/performance cookies. These allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our websites when they are using them. This helps us to improve the way our websites work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.   

  * Functionality cookies. These are used to recognize you when you return to our websites. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).   

  * Targeting cookies. These cookies record your visit to our websites, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our websites and the advertising displayed on them more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.   




Except for essential cookies, all cookies will expire after 10 years.

Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. However, if you block or erase cookies, we may be unable to restore previously specified preferences or customization settings and our ability to personalize your online experience may be limited. Please refer to your browser instructions or "help" screen to learn more about these functions.

Additionally, we may ask you to provide individually identifiable personal information which may include without limitation your e-mail address, name, business title, mailing address, and telephone number.

Please do not provide us with personal information that we do not request as we will have no responsibility or liability to you for the consequences of your doing so.

## USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION 

Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the websites, pages viewed and to improve the content of our websites.

We use your personal information to respond to your inquiries or to process your requests (such as to receive promotional materials). We also use it to administer our websites and for internal operations, including work planning, management and strategic decision making, troubleshooting, data analysis and hygiene, for updating and validating databases, product development, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes.

We may also use your personal information to provide you, and/or permit selected third parties to provide you, with information about products, services, promotions or events that may interest you. Aptean and these selected third parties may contact you by telephone, mail or by other means for these purposes. We and our selected third parties will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) if you have consented to this in advance. If you do not want us to use your data in the manner described in this paragraph, or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, [please tell us](http://www.aptean.com/privacy-statement#yourrights).

We may share your personal information with other companies that are involved directly in providing services to us.We will only share personal information about you that is reasonably necessary for the other companies to have in order to provide their services to Aptean. These companies are contractually bound to use personal information we share with them only to perform the services we have engaged them to provide. We may also share your information with selected third parties including business partners for the performance of any contract we enter into with them.

We will release information about you if you direct us to do so, if we are required by law to do so, or in other legally limited circumstances (for example, to protect you from fraud). If Aptean or one of its affiliates is sold (either through a merger into another entity or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the selling entity), we may disclose your personal information to the prospective buyer because personal information about the selling entity’s customers is typically one of the assets that is transferred to the buyer
