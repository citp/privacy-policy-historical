**SX2 MEDIA LABS PRIVACY STATEMENT**

This is the official privacy statement that applies to a proprietary network of Web sites owned and controlled by SX2 Media Labs LLC ("SX2", "we," "us", or "our"). We take your privacy seriously and are committed to keeping our users' information secure. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. This privacy statement applies to the Web site that you were viewing when you clicked through to this privacy statement, which is operated by or on behalf of us, or our affiliate. 

**YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

Under the California Civil Code, residents of the State of California have the right to request, from companies conducting business in California, a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed personally identifiable information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy statement that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personally identifiable information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide and disclose to you information on how to you can exercise your choice to opt-out or opt-in regarding the use of your personally identifiable information. 

SX2s qualifies for the alternative option: it has a comprehensive privacy statement and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out of or opt-in to the use of your personally identifiable information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personally identifiable information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. 

If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party opt-out or opt-in rights, you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (e-mail or postal mail). Send an e-mail to the Privacy Administrator at info@sx2medialabs.com, or you may contact us via postal mail at:

**1\. Information Collected**

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services. Several of the services and features that we offer on our Web sites require you to provide us with information as a condition of usage. These include access to subscription-only areas, the ability to post opinions or other content, participation in sweepstakes or contests, subscriptions to print magazines and e-mail newsletters and participation in message boards. 

We collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number and credit card information when you provide it to us. From time to time, we may also collect other information such as your job title, gender, username and password. We may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you provided to us. We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information and while no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure, we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your personally identifiable information 

Once you register with one of our Web sites you are no longer anonymous to us. 

**2\. Cookies and Similar Technology**

We use 'cookie' technology to collect data regarding your visits to our Web sites. This data is stored in aggregate form and is not used to identify any particular user or individual. We use cookies and similar tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including: 

  1. Keeping count of your return visits to our Web sites or our advertisers' or partners' Web sites; 
  2. Accumulating and reporting aggregate, statistical information in connection with SX2; 
  3. Determining which features users and registered users like best; and 
  4. Saving your user identification or other information so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Web site. 

Although we may track the numbers of visitors to inform us on how best to update and enhance the Web site experience, personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process. 

We allow third parties that are presenting advertisements on our Web sites and, sometimes, in our newsletters to use tracking technology on your computer. The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not ours. Even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those Web sites or their policies and practices regarding your information. **This privacy statement does not cover any use of personally identifiable information that a third party advertiser or ad server may collect from you.** We encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard. Our advertisers' use of tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies. 

**3\. Disclosure to Third Parties**

These companies are only allowed to use the information in order to help us fulfill our services to you. We do not provide your personally identifiable information to these companies for their own, permanent use.

  9. In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us, or our affiliates.

**4\. Opt-in and Opt-out**

**5\. Security & Protection of Personally Identifiable Information**

We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. However, for most Web sites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of our Web sites. We also limit access to the Web site by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our service providers follow the same policy. 

**6\. Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information**

You can review, correct, or change the information collected during registration for any of our Web sites. The instructions for doing this can be found in our member-services areas.
