**Compassion International Privacy Statement**

Compassion International is committed to respecting your privacy and security. We provide this Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy and security practices, and to inform you about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and from the bottom of every Compassion International web page. Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified) either online or offline, you can be assured that it will only be used to support your relationship with Compassion International.

**Information Collected**

In your relationship with Compassion International, you can become a sponsor, make donations, request materials or subscribe to magazines, emails or SMS text messages. The types of personal information we may collect include name, contact and billing information, transaction and payment information. As you write letters to children, those messages will be stored digitally in our systems. Finally if you apply for a job, all related application information will be collected and stored. In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our services, we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experiences as a sponsor, and contact preferences.

**Use and Disclosure of Information**

Compassion International uses your information to understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, communicate back to you, update you on your sponsored child and special events, and to personalize our services and communications with you. Credit card and/or checking account information is used only for payment processing and is not retained for other purposes. From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or provide you with information we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we will always give you the opportunity to opt out or decline Compassion marketing or market research contact. We will also follow local requirements, such as allowing you to opt in before receiving unsolicited contact, where applicable. Data collected may also be combined with information you provide when you register as a Compassion sponsor. Furthermore, we use 3rd-party demographic data (such as age, gender and interests) to better understand how our website is used and to make improvements in usability.

**Who we share it with**

It is Compassion International’s policy to ensure that personal data is not used or disclosed except as necessary to provide services, to protect the confidentiality or security of personal data or as otherwise permitted by law. Compassion International does not rent, sell, or lease personal data with others. However, in those situations where we retain third parties to perform processing tasks or other activities, and transfers personal data to those partners or to any of our international offices, we require that these groups agree to provide at least an equivalent level of protection as provided by Compassion International.

**Links to Other Resources**

Our web sites may contain links to other online resources. We provide the links for your convenience, but we do not review, control, or monitor the privacy practices of online resources operated by others. This Privacy Statement does not apply to any other online resources where a link to this Privacy Statement does not appear. We are not responsible for the performance of sites operated by third parties or for your business dealings with them. Therefore, whenever you leave this Web Site we recommend that you review each site's privacy practices and make your own conclusions regarding the adequacy of these practices.

**Choice**

Compassion International will not use or share the personally identifiable information you provide to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and offering you a choice. As previously stated, you may let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited direct marketing materials from us, and we will do everything we can to honor such requests.

**Accuracy**

Compassion International takes reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is reliable, accurate, and complete.
