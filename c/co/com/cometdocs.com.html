	We will not share, sell, lease, disclose, transfer, transmit or rent any personal information you submit through the Cometdocs.com website without your consent.</p>
<p>
	Below are described the categories of information we collect from and about you when you use our services:</p>
<p>
	-Contact information-<br>
	When you create an account on Cometdocs, purchase a subscription from us, or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions, a contract is formed between you and us. With the aim to perform our obligations that are under the contract, we have to process your information including your full name and email address. Additionally, we may ask you for personal information at other times, such as when you contact our support team, or communicate with Cometdocs in any other way.</p>
<p>
	-Registration through integrated sign-up services-<br>
	If you register through Facebook, Google, or Microsoft mail, we may collect your personal information that is already correlated with your account on mentioned integrated services.</p>
<p>
	We will continue to process your personal information until the contract between us ends or is terminated by either party under the terms of the contract.</p>
<p>
	In certain occasions when there is no contract between us, such as when you browse our website or ask us to provide you more information about our business, you give your consent to us to process your information. By asking you to agree to our use of cookies we are asking you for your explicit consent to process such information.</p>
