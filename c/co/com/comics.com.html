<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>At Universal Uclick ("Uclick"), we respect your right to privacy and we understand that visitors to Universal
  Uclick's Web Sites need to control the uses of their personal information. The privacy policy below details the
  measures taken by Universal Uclick to protect your privacy in connection with your use of

  <a href="http://www.comicssherpa.com">www.ComicsSherpa.com</a> ,
  <a href="http://www.infinitecrosswords.com/">www.InfiniteCrosswords.com</a> and other sites or applications owned and
  operated by Universal Uclick, ("Sites"). Universal Uclick does not intend to collect any personal information from
  children under 13 unless Universal Uclick believes such collection to be permitted by law;
  <a href="#kids">please read below for Universal Uclick's policy with respect to children under 13.</a></p>

<p><strong>What does the this Privacy Policy cover?</strong><br>
  This policy covers the treatment and use of personally identifiable information that is collected by Universal Uclick,
  at any of its owned, operated or affiliated Web sites and when you sign up to use any of the services provided at the
  sites.</p>

<p>This policy does not cover information that may or may not be collected by companies or Web sites that Universal
  Uclick does not own or control. This policy also does not guide the behavior of individuals not employed by Universal
  Uclick.</p>

<p>
  <strong>How is my personally identifiable information used by Universal Uclick?</strong><br>
  Universal Uclick is the sole owner of the information collected from the Universal Uclick service. Your Personal
  Information can only be collected when you voluntarily provide it.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>What is "Personal Information"?</strong><br>
  Personal Information is individually identifiable information about a person. This information can include a first and
  last name, credit card number, a home, billing or e-mail address or a personal identifier that reveals an individual's
  e-mail address, or a telephone or social security number. Personal information also includes a persistent identifier,
  such as a customer number held in a cookie (See below for definition of "cookie"), where such identifier is associated
  with individually identifiable information.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Customized Experience</strong><br>
  Universal Uclick gathers user information to provide you with a customized experience on our sites and other services.
  Your user information helps us tailor the content, services, goods and advertising to your current and future needs.
  For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information when you visit certain areas of our
  site, register for free services, order products, enter contests or subscribe to a newsletter. If you choose not to
  register, you may not have access to areas that require personal identification.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Subscription Services</strong><br>

  If you subscribe to our site(s) for premium content services, Universal Uclick will gather user information and
  personal information to grant you access to the site(s). Universal Uclick may use third parties to accept and process
  orders and credit card purchases for subscriptions, merchandise and products. If you choose not to register you may
  not have access to subscription areas that require personal identification.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>E-mail Delivery</strong><br>
  If you register with our site(s) for daily e-mail delivery, subscription services or purchase products from us, from
  time to time, we may e-mail you with informative messages about our services or third party products and services we
  believe may be of interest to you, such as new features and services, special offers and updated information. These
  e-mails may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the e-mail, including whether the e-mail was
  opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked. We will combine that information to other information we have about
  you and may use that information to improve your site experience and/or provide customized e-mail communications to
  you.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Mobile Messaging</strong><br>
  Universal Uclick might gather some personal information specific to participating in mobile messaging programs. The
  information requested may include contact, mobile phone numbers, carriers, and models for product delivery, and
  demographic information.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>When does Universal Uclick collect my information, including personally identifiable
    information?</strong><br>
  When you register, Universal Uclick asks for your e-mail address, a user selected user name, and other information.
  Once you are a registered user you can update your profile and may be able to provide additional preferential
  information (e.g. a member name, a nickname, and certain user preferences). Universal Uclick may also ask for other
  optional information. <a href="#kids">(See below on Universal Uclick's policy with respect to children under 13)</a>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Subscription Services</strong><br>
  When you subscribe, Universal Uclick asks for your e-mail address, a user selected user name, password and other
  necessary financial information to process the order. Credit card information is collected by Universal Uclick,
  however, the specific credit card number is not stored within the Universal Uclick System. Contact information from
  the order is used to fulfill premium purchases to our registered users and to get in touch with the user when deemed
  necessary. Once you are a subscribed user you can update your profile and may be able to provide additional
  preferential information. Universal Uclick may also ask for other optional information.
  <a href="#kids">(See below on Universal Uclick's policy with respect to children under 13)</a>

</p>

<p>
  <strong>Order Forms and Products Store</strong><br>
  Universal Uclick also uses an order form for users to request information, products and services. For that order form,
  we collect a user's contact information (e-mail address) and necessary financial information to process the order
  (i.e. credit card number). Contact information from the order is used to send orders to our registered users and to
  get in touch with the user when deemed necessary. Universal Uclick may use third parties to accept and process orders
  and credit card purchases for merchandise and products. For some products, third parties host the store pages,
  ordering system, order data, collect order information, contact information and necessary financial information to
  process the order. Please see the privacy policies on their Web sites for more information about how CafePress uses
  this information.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Special Contests or Promotions</strong><br>
  Universal Uclick may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company. To
  qualify for entry in that contest or promotion, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share
  that information with the sponsor(s) or with others, we will provide a statement to that effect in the contest or
  promotion terms.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>IP Address</strong><br>

  An Internet Protocol (IP) address is unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet
  Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We will use your IP address to
  help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our site. Your IP address also may be used to gather broad
  demographic information.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
  A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser for record-keeping purposes and to help us
  provide better service to you. Your browser has options to accept, reject, or provide you with notice when a cookie is
  sent. Universal Uclick may utilize "cookie" technology by sending and/or receiving information from our computers to
  your browser and computer. We also use cookies to customize our site(s) and deliver content specific to your
  interests.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Computer-Generated Information</strong><br>
  Universal Uclick may use server logs to track your movement through our Web sites and properties - in addition, we may
  use this information to customize the user experience or provide registrant continuity between our various Web sites
  and properties. Universal Uclick may also use other technologies to verify and track your use of certain services,
  confirm receipt of certain e-mailed products or to test the integrity of our systems, products and services.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Advertisements</strong><br>
  The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by our Web advertising partners. In the process of serving
  ads, advertisers place a cookie in your browser's cookie file and may use information (excluding your name, address,
  e-mail address or other personal information) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide
  advertisements on this site and other Web sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. By delivering
  ads on the Sites, Universal Uclick is able to record what ads a user -- identified by the unique cookie -- has seen,
  and what Universal Uclick site pages the user was viewing when the ads were delivered. This Web usage information is
  combined with other ad delivery information Universal Uclick has (e.g., what type of operating system your computer
  uses) collected from your visits to Universal Uclick Sites and other sites not affiliated with Universal Uclick. This
  non-personally identifiable information is used as part of the ad serving process for reporting and to select and
  direct the ads you see online at Universal Uclick Sites. Additionally, some ads are generated by third party ad
  serving systems that also may place a cookie on your browser to provide web usage information to those third parties.
  Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34)
  or audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the
  advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. As always
  remember, we only authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous
  targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access to, any personally identifying
  information about you. To find out more about those specific third party ad serving systems, please click to their

  <strong>Opting Out of Third-Party Ad Servers</strong><br>
  We recognize that not all users wish to receive ads targeted to their interests and we put the wishes of our users
  first. If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you
  must visit each ad network’s Web site individually and opt out of this type of advertising. You may find more
  information from these sites:<br>

  If you would like to opt-out of third party ad serving cookies now click here:
  <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>. This
  opt-out feature replaces a network advertiser's unique online preference marketing cookie on your browser with a
  general opt-out cookie; it does not delete cookies and does not necessarily replace other cookies placed by network
  advertisers, such as those that are used for aggregate ad reporting or mere ad serving purposes. Such cookies allow
  network advertisers to rotate ad banners sequentially and track aggregate numbers of impressions. Please see the
  companies' privacy policies for more details or visit the

  Universal Uclick, the most important thing is that you make the choice that is best for you.

  <strong>Who does Universal Uclick share information with?</strong><br>
  We will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties (aside from entities that perform
  services for us, such as fulfilling orders, that either are bound to comply with our privacy policy or have privacy
  policies that protect your information) unless you have "opted-in" to such sharing. If you have previously opted-in to
  such sharing under a prior privacy policy version, you are still considered to have opted-in under this Privacy
  Statement. As stated, Universal Uclick may use third parties to accept and process orders for merchandise and
  products.

</p>

<p>
  However, Universal Uclick may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith
  belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on Universal Uclick; (2)
  protect and defend the rights or property of Universal Uclick; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety.
</p>

<p>
  We may gather demographic information from you (for example, your age, education level or household income) from time
  to time. We will not share that information in a manner that identifies you as an individual with any other entity,
  unless we let you know that at the time of collection or we have your permission. When we share demographic
  information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only.
</p>

<p>
  As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets, and, depending upon the transaction, your personal information
  may be one of the transferred assets. In the event that Universal Uclick is acquired by another company, your personal
  information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.<br>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>What are my options to control the use of my personally identifiable information?</strong><br>

  You will have the ability to request the deletion of your Universal Uclick registration at any time by utilizing the
  registration system established for this purpose. However, we may maintain certain other information as part of our
  internal processes to prevent accidental loss of user data or information and to prevent or discourage fraudulent
  activities that may involve Universal Uclick registration or account information. We may also continue to maintain
  information about your registration or account and your computer access to our Web sites or services as part of our
  server logs
</p>

<p>
  Unless you opt-out we may e-mail you with information from Universal Uclick, including information about selected
  third parties. If you do not want to receive information from Universal Uclick or third parties that we have selected,
  you may decline to receive it (or "Opt-Out") when you provide personal information to Universal Uclick, or you may
  visit your "My Account" page and click on "Update Billing Information" to updated your settings. You may also contact
  Universal Uclick by postal mail at the address below.</p>

<p><strong><a name="kids"></a>What about kids' personally identifiable information?</strong><br>
  The Universal Uclick Sites are general audience sites and are not directed to children under the age of 13. Universal
  Uclick assumes products purchased through credit card means are purchased by adults. Universal Uclick respects the
  privacy of parents and children and is committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
  (COPPA). On those areas of the Sites that ask for age, Universal Uclick does not collect personal information from
  individuals who identify themselves as under the age of 13 except in those limited circumstances where Universal
  Uclick believes that such collection is permitted under COPPA.
</p>

<p>
  Universal Uclick may ask prospective users to provide their age during the registration process and on other areas of
  the Universal Uclick Sites. If a user indicates that he or she is under the age of 13 then all personal data collected
  during the registration process is automatically deleted except Universal Uclick may retain and use limited
  information, such as the child's e-mail address, for a limited period of time, in those cases where Universal Uclick
  believes that the collection and use of such information is permitted under COPPA.
</p>

<p>
  If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to Universal Uclick, he or she can
  contact us via e-mail or postal mail as listed below. Universal Uclick will promptly delete the information upon
  learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13.
</p>

<p>
  Universal Uclick believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental
  control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online
  environment. These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other
  personal information without parental permission.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Universal Uclick's Commitment to Data Security</strong><br>
  Protecting user privacy and Personal Information is a high priority for Universal Uclick. We use our best efforts to
  ensure the security of your Personal Information. Universal Uclick maintains physical, electronic and procedural
  safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your Personal Information. We exercise great care in
  providing secure transmission of information between your PC and our computers. Unfortunately, no electronic
  communication over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to take great care to protect

  your own risk.
</p>

<p>
  We also take precautions to protect your Personal Information off-line. Access to all user information is restricted.
  Only our employees, agents and processors whose jobs require accessing users' Personal Information are granted
  database access or administrator-level accounts on servers that contain such Personal Information. Finally, all
  servers containing users' Personal Information are kept locked in a secure data center and require a secure login to
  access them remotely.

<p>
  <strong>Security</strong><br>
  Universal Uclick has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under
  our control. These include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and maintenance of registration
  information in a separate database. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of
  information between your computer and our servers, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
  transmitted to us over the Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure. We will protect the
  transmission of credit card information through industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. We use
  <a href="https://www.thawte.com/home.html">thawte</a> SSL Web Server Certificates to offer secure communications by
  encrypting all data to and from the site. thawte has checked and verified the company registration documents and the
  site's registered domain name.

  from their database.
