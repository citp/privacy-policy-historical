## Common Sense Home Privacy Policy

### SUMMARY

We do track some personal information. We use cookies to see if you have visited. Our advertisers track some of your activity and we use your email to send you offers from time to time. We make money from the advertising, and we also make some money if you buy stuff on sites we link to. You can opt out of the email (click unsubscribe at the bottom of ALL Common Sense Home emails). You can also use software to disable cookies or advertising.

### COOKIES

Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information

We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits, keep track of advertisements and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.

## WHAT WE TRACK

Site visits, unique visits, pageviews, device, O/S or browser, page activity (ie which pages you view and in what order) we also track rough location using TCP/IP information through Google – but we don’t have direct TCP/IP tracking information – only aggregate data.

You may also choose to share our site using share buttons, again, some information is tracked. These are all voluntary. Note we require a double opt-in for email; you must click and enter your email – and then agree via an email.

## HOW WE USE THE DATA

We use the tracked information for advertising, tracking who is reading what, and help us determine what we should work on and what we shouldn’t. Primarily cookies. This allows us to use Google Analytics to get statistics about site usage. We also have some WordPress specific tracking and plugin tracking, some of the security tools track the source of actual or suspected attacks.
