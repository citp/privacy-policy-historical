Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide us statistical information.

Cookies are used to a minimal extent on this website and never collect your personal details. A session cookie is used to keep track of the contents of your shopping cart - it does not store any of your personal information like your name or address. Cookies are used by Google through Google Analytics (which provides us with general anonymous statistical information on how people browse our website), YouTube where we show videos (again no personal data is collected) and our search engine which is powered by Google. When you make a payment, your order details are passed to Paypal which is one of the safest payment processors in the world. Paypal uses cookies to help you through the payment process. You can [view Paypal's Privacy Policy here](https://cms.paypal.com/uk/cgi-bin/marketingweb?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=ua/Privacy_full&locale.x=en_GB).
