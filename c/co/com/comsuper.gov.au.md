CSC's primary function is to manage and invest the funds of the schemes in the best interests of all members and in accordance with the provisions of the various [acts and deeds ](http://www.csc.gov.au/about-us/legislation/)that govern the schemes.

CSC's statutory functions are set out in the _Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Act 2011_ and scheme legislation and deeds. CSC, as the trustee of the CSS, PSS, MilitarySuper and PSSap is also required to comply with, for example, the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_ and regulations, the _Corporations Act 2001_ and regulations, tax legislation and regulations, and the _Anti-Money Laundering & Counter Terrorism Financing Act 2006._

### Collection, holding, use and disclosure of information

Personal information is collected, held, used and disclosed as required or authorised by law, for the purpose of managing the superannuation schemes and member accounts of Australian Government employees and members of the Australian Defence Force for their retirement. This includes the management of superannuation investments, providing superannuation products and information to members, administration of the superannuation schemes and member accounts, conducting market research and product development.

  
Personal information is primarily provided to CSC directly or through external service providers:

  * Pillar Administration (Pillar) [ABN 80 976 223 967] provides scheme administration services for the PSSap. This includes processing and administering member accounts, such as receiving employer contributions and maintaining records. Their privacy policy is available at [pillar.com.au](http://pillar.com.au/)
  * AIA Australia Limited (AIA) [ABN 79 004 837 861, AFSL 230043] provides insurance options available to certain PSSap and PSS members. AIA's privacy policy is available at [aia.com.au](http://www.aia.com.au/)
  * Industry Fund Services (IFS) [ABN 54 007 016 195, AFSL 232514] provides financial advice to members. IFS's privacy policy is available at [ifs.net.au](http://ifs.net.au/)
  * the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (SCT).



Pillar, AIA and IFS may pass on personal information to CSC for the purpose of managing the superannuation schemes and member accounts.

  
Personal information is provided to these service providers or to CSC directly from the superannuation member themselves, a third party associated with the member such as an adviser or family member under a power of attorney (consent is obtained from the member in these circumstances) or through an eligible employer who makes superannuation contributions on the members behalf.

  
CSC may also collect, hold, use and disclose information to and from a court or tribunal where required.

### Type of information

The type of personal information that is collected, held, used and disclosed includes information about superannuation contributions, name and address details, date of birth, salary, employment details, beneficiary details and contact details.

  
Sensitive information is collected where consent has been provided and the information is reasonably necessary for one or more of CSC's functions or activities. Sensitive information can also be collected where the collection of information is required or authorised by or under an Australian law or a court/tribunal order. Examples of sensitive information that is collected, held used and disclosed includes health information, sexual preferences or practices and criminal records.

  
Information is collected via email, correspondence, telephone, or gained through the website. Sensitive information is more likely to be collected, held, used and disclosed in circumstances where an insurance or legal claim is being decided or contested, where a reconsideration of a decision is sought either internally or through the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (SCT).

  
Sensitive information is primarily provided to CSC through external service providers, such as scheme administrators, insurers or by external dispute resolution bodies (such as the SCT), when dealing with claims or complaints.

### Overseas recipients

CSC does not disclose personal information to overseas recipients. Where permitted by law, CSC's scheme administrators may disclose personal information for the international transfer of superannuation benefits to an approved superannuation scheme.

### Inaccurate information

Where information is not provided by a superannuation member, or is inaccurate, a superannuation member may not be provided with an appropriate level of service. For example, a higher rate of taxation may be payable by the member where a Tax File Number has not been provided.

### Accessing and correcting your information

Members of the superannuation schemes managed by CSC may request access to information held about them under the _Privacy Act 1988_ and the _Freedom of Information Act 1982._ Further information about FOI and CSC's Information Publication Scheme can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/reports-and-information/information-publication-scheme/)

  
CSC or its scheme administrator takes steps to ensure that personal information is accurate, up to date and complete, including maintaining and updating records when advised that the information has changed.
