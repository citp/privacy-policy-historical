## Introduction

ComSuper places great importance on maintaining and enhancing the privacy and security of your personal information. We are continuously developing our online services and have a number of strong security measures in place to protect your information from unlawful disclosure. Our main focus is on improving existing measures as well as keeping you informed about the latest developments.

ComSuper protects the privacy of your personal information in line with the Information Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988. There is also other Commonwealth legislation which protects the security of your information. The Information Privacy Principles apply to any personal information you provide to us, including but not limited to email, website, correspondence or information provided by telephone. 

For more information see ComSuper’s [General Privacy Guidelines](https://web.archive.org/web/20040605111040id_/http%3A//www.comsuper.gov.au/pages/privacy_statement.htm). You can also obtain further information from the Privacy Commissioner’s website [www.privacy.gov.au](http://www.privacy.gov.au/) or through direct personal contact with that agency.

## Collection of information via website activity 

### When you visit our Website

Each time someone visits one of our sites, we collect the following types of information:

  * How often the site was used;
  * The time of day the site was accessed;
  * What browser types are being used.



No attempts are made to identify anyone browsing our site. The data is captured so that we can accurately evaluate the quality of our content and make improvements.

### When you use secure online services

The type of information we collect from you will depend on what online services you use. When using any of ComSuper’s secure online services we will collect and hold your access number or “user ID” and details of all transactions. Details of these transactions will be stored to validate transactions against your computer record. 

Access numbers allow members secure access to member services online where they can

  * view their member statements;
  * change their contact details;
  * use our online calculator, the i-Estimator; and
  * for members of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme, elect for Member Investment Choice.



In order to maintain the security of this service, ComSuper has a statutory responsibility to all members to ensure their Access Numbers are not disclosed to unlawful recipients.

Therefore, we provide Access Numbers to members only after we are sure that they are the lawful recipients. To do this, we require members to apply for new or replacement Access Numbers in writing, either by fax or post. All applications must also contain the member’s signature, AGS/Service number and current postal address.

As a further security measure, new or replacement Access Numbers will only be valid for a period of 60 days from the date of issue. If the Access Number is not activated within that time, it will expire.

### When you email us

ComSuper records your e-mail address but it is used only for the purpose for which it was provided. 

### Personal Information collected

Personal information is collected by ComSuper in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988. For more information about the manner in which personal information is collected, see ComSuper’s [General Privacy Guidelines](https://web.archive.org/web/20040605111040id_/http%3A//www.comsuper.gov.au/pages/privacy_statement.htm). 

## Use and disclosure of information

Personal information provided to ComSuper when you send us a message will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it. Your details will not be added to a general mailing list. Unless required or authorised by law, ComSuper will not disclose this information without consent.

## Cookies

Cookies are pieces of information that a website can transfer to an individual's computer hard drive. Parts of this website use a temporary "session cookie" to maintain the users current authenticated connection.  The cookie does not contain any information about the user or their PC.  The cookie becomes invalid as soon as the user closes their browser or their session times out.

## Access to information

In the unlikely event of an investigation, a law enforcement agency or other government agency may exercise its legal authority to inspect our Internet Service Provider’s logs and ComSuper’s logs.

## Security Statement

Commonwealth laws protect your personal information. These laws prohibit any person from accessing, using or disclosing any personal information in the possession of ComSuper unless it is in the performance of their duties or is in accordance with these laws. Penalties apply for failure to observe these provisions.

When using online services all information passing between your Personal Computer and the secure section of our website is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Freely available browsers that support SSL include Netscape version 6 and Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5.

While we endeavour to provide a secure Internet environment, users should note that there are inherent risks associated with the transmission of information via the Internet. We provide alternative means of communication including direct contact via telephone, facsimile, post or face to face meetings.
