	choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Site or Services. We may also collect
	Personal Information from you when you access the Services and/or other parts of the Site and elect to provide Personal Information.</p><p><i>Non-Personal Information</i></p><p>We may collect additional information that you provide but that does not personally identify you. Because we may change our offerings and features from
time to time, the non-personal information that we ask you to provide us also may change but some examples of non-personal information we may ask you to

	Web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, the pages you view, how you interact with links on the Services and the time
	and duration of your visits to the Site. We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors

website that monitors usage). We use cookies and Web beacons to improve the experience of the Site and Services, such as pre-populating your username for
easier login. We do not use cookies or Web beacons to collect Personal Information. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. At this time,
Crew32 does not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking, including "do-not-track" signals. You can remove persistent cookies and change your
privacy preferences by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" directory. However, certain features of the Site or Services may not
