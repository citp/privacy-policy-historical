Thank you for visiting the Department of Commerce Web site, a service of the U.S. Department of Commerce. This policy establishes how we will handle information we learn about you from your visit to our site.

The specific practices outlined in this privacy statement apply to Web sites maintained by or on behalf of the Office of the Secretary of Commerce. Other organizations within the Department of Commerce may have slightly different practices, though the overarching commitment to your privacy will always be the same. You are encouraged to review the privacy policies of other organizations when visiting their Web sites.

Some of our Web pages contain links to Web sites outside the Department of Commerce, including those of other federal agencies, state and local governments, and private organizations. Please be aware that when you follow a link to another site, you are then subject to the privacy policies of the new site.

  * in the more advanced cases they track your movements through many Web sites but not the whole Web; 
  * businesses use them for customer convenience to allow them to produce a list of items to buy and pay for them all at one time and to garner information about what individuals are buying at their sites; 
  * advertisers use them to determine the effectiveness of their marketing and offer insights into consumer preferences and tastes by collecting data from many Web sites; and 
  * they can be used to help a Web site tailor screens for each customer's preference.

**Personal Information via Forms** : Some of our sites provide forms allowing visitors to submit search engine queries, questionnaires, feedback, or other information.

We may store non-personally identifiable information we collect (such as search engine queries and anonymous survey responses) indefinitely to help us better understand and meet the needs of our visitors. We may share non-personally identifiable information with others, including the public, in aggregated form (for instance, in a list of our most popular search engine queries), in partial or edited form (such as in a report summarizing responses to a questionnaire), or verbatim (for example, in a complete listing of survey responses).
