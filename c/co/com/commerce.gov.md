# Department of Commerce Home Page - Commerce Privacy Statement

Thank you for visiting the Department of Commerce web site, a service of the U.S. Department of Commerce. This policy establishes how we will handle information we learn about you from your visit to our site. Please be assured that the privacy of our visitors is of utmost importance to us. **We collect no personal information about you when you visit our site unless you choose to provide that information to us.**

The specific practices outlined in this privacy statement apply to web sites maintained by or on behalf of the Office of the Secretary of Commerce. Other organizations within the Department of Commerce may have slightly different practices, though the overarching commitment to your privacy will always be the same. You are encouraged to review the privacy statements of other organizations when visiting their web sites.

Some of our web pages contain links to web sites outside the Department of Commerce, including those of other federal agencies, state and local governments, and private organizations. Please be aware that when you follow a link to another site, you are then subject to the privacy policies of the new site.

**If you visit an Office of the Secretary web site...**

> **...to read or download information:** For each HTTP request received, we collect and store _only_ the following information: the date and time, the originating IP address, the type of browser and operating system used (if provided by the browser), the URL of the referring page (if provided by the browser), the object requested, and the completion status of the request.
> 
> We use the information that we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different areas of our sites, and to help us make our sites more useful to visitors. This includes analyzing these logs periodically to determine the traffic through our servers, the number of pages served, and the level of demand for pages and topics of interest. The logs may be preserved indefinitely and used at any time and in any way necessary to prevent security breaches and to insure the integrity of the data on our servers.
> 
> We do not seek or collect any other data related to the specific users of Office of the Secretary servers, nor do we use web browser cookies of any type, for any purpose, on these servers.
> 
> **...to complete an online form:** Some of our sites provide forms allowing visitors to submit search engine queries, questionnaires, feedback, or other information. Some of these forms may request personally-identifying information ( _e.g.,_ name, address, e-mail address) for specific purposes, such as when the submitter is requesting a personal response, registering for a conference, or subscribing to a mailing list.
> 
> We may store non-personally-identifying information we collect (such as search engine queries and anonymous survey responses) indefinitely to help us better understand and meet the needs of our visitors. We may share non-personally-identifying information with others, including the the public, in aggregated form (for instance, in a list of our most popular search engine queries), in partial or edited form (such as in a report summarizing responses to a questionnaire), or verbatim (for example, in a complete listing of survey responses).
> 
> Before collecting personally-identifying information, we will prominently disclose: 
> 
>   * why we are requesting the information; 
>   * how it will be used; 
>   * how long it may be retained; and 
>   * under what conditions, and with whom, it may be shared. 
> 

> 
> Generally, we will not share any personally-identifying information you give us with any other government agency, private organization, or the public, except with your consent or as required by law.
> 
> **...to send us e-mail:** By sending us an electronic mail message (for example, an e-mail message containing an official Freedom of Information Act request), you may be sending us personally-identifying information. In these cases, we may retain the information as long as necessary to respond to your request or otherwise resolve the subject matter of your e-mail. Please be aware that email is not necessarily secure from interception or misdirection. For your own protection you may wish to communicate sensitive information using a method other than email.

We want to be very clear: **regardless of the information being transmitted to any unit of the Department of Commerce, we will protect all such information consistent with applicable law** including, but not limited to, the [Privacy Act of 1974 and the Freedom of Information Act](http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/552.html). It is also the policy of the Department to follow the **Principles for Providing and Using Personal Information** ("Privacy Principles"), published by the Information Infrastructure Task Force on June 6, 1995.
