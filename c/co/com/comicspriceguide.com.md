### Use of Cookies

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, CPG sites use "cookies" to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that tracks the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. All sites on CPG where you are prompted to login or that are customizable require that you accept cookies.

Advertising networks that serve ads onto any of CPG's sites may also use their own cookies.

From time to time, CPG and/or CPG advertisers may offer contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information. At a minimum, the required information includes name and email address; in some cases, the user must answer mandatory survey questions about a range of other personal data. The information gathered in the entry form is used to verify the entrant's identity, to send the entrant an email notification that their entry has been received, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients. There are two situations in which CPG will divulge this information to a third party--provided the user gives express consent:

  * A user may expressly choose to receive additional information from the contest sponsor, in which case the user's personally identifiable information is divulged to the advertiser.
  * Some of the contests may be hosted on the CPG site but administered by the sponsor; in such cases, the information a user provides is passed on to the third party as long as that user gives express consent.



Because the rules and terms of each contest can vary, all information about each contest is clearly posted during the event. All contests and sweepstakes are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state laws.

### **Links**

CPG contains links to sites. CPG is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site a user should read the privacy policy stated on that site. Our privacy policy only governs information collected on CPG.

### **Discussions and Articles**

Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information on CPG or any other Public Forums that that information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications.

### **Security**

CPG member accounts are secured by member-created passwords. CPG takes precautions to insure that member account information is kept private. We use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to member information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time For any additional information about the security measures we use on CPG, please contact us a support@comicspriceguide.com.

### Third Party Collectors of Information

Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are bidders, buyers or sellers on comicspriceguide.com or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy customs and policies. Since CPG does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

### Deleting or Changing Your Registration Information

Upon request, CPG will remove credit card number and credit card expiration date from the membership file. Requests are to be forwarded to support@comicspriceguide.com.

You may review and change your email subscriptions and/or registration information, including your password, name, address, phone number, and email address, by editing your profile in Account Tools.

You may change your credit card number and credit card expiration date on file by accessing the Account Tools Basics tab.

Requests for removal of your registration information does not ensure that such information will be completely removed from the CPG system. CPG does retain registration information as a record of all activity performed on the site. Additionally, information is retained in order to enforce the Terms of Agreement, resolve disputes and problems associated with the site.

Once posted, you cannot change or remove any public postings made in newsgroups or other message areas.

### Changes in Our Privacy Policy

From time to time we may make changes to our privacy policy If we make changes, we will post them on our site to make users aware of what the changes are so users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose it. A User is bound by any minor changes to the policy when she or he uses the site after those changes have been posted. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify by posting a notice on the CPG site for 30 days.
