**With whom the information may be shared?**

Information we collect may be accessed by a variety of parties, depending upon the project for which the information was originally collected, the terms of that engagement, and the policies into or out of which the consumer has opted. From time to time, we may send you offers from Comic-Con International, its affiliated properties, and our promotional partners based on the information you have provided us. We may share anonymous, aggregate demographic information and anonymous information obtained from cookies and similar technologies, with our advertisers, sponsors, promotional and business partners, and participating vendors. In addition, we will provide information we collect about you with third party companies involved with online badge registration or hotel room reservations.

We may also disclose personally identifiable information to non-affiliated third parties as permitted by law.

**What choices do I have about Comic-Con International collecting, using, and sharing my information?**

While we believe the limited disclosure of your information will result in opportunities that may be of interest to you, you have the right to tell us not to give your information to any third party. As noted above, Comic-Con International uses third-party venders for various administrative functions (e.g., Registration) for its events. In order for these venders to be able to provide the necessary services they need to have access to member information.

Given the concerns relating to the transfer of member information, we allow members to control the scope of transfer by providing two types of Opt-Outs for member information. The first Opt-Out allows a member to Opt-Out of having their information transferred to third-parties who are not involved in any administrative or operational aspect of an event. Selecting this Opt-Out still allows Comic-Con International to transfer the information on an as needed basis to venders who are involved in administrative or operational aspects of an event. To select this Opt-Out, login to your Member ID account, select the "Change My Preferences" option, then select the "Non-Critical Transfers" Opt- Out.

The second Opt-Out is for those members who do not want any of the information transferred to any third party. This Opt-Out If you do not want Comic-Con International to share your information with any third party, login to your Member ID account, select the "Change My Preferences" option, and select the "Cancel Member ID" Opt-Out. Please note that by selecting this "Cancel Member ID" option, your Comic-Con membership will be canceled and you will not be able to purchase badges and you will not be able to make hotel reservations through our vender. If you have already purchased a badge for Comic-Con 2012, that badge will be canceled and the purchase price will be refunded if the membership cancelation was requested before the refund deadline. Periodically our website may not allow members to enter "Cancel Member ID" requests due to system maintenance or for other reasons. If this occurs, please try again at a later date.

**What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?**

We use standard industry practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. Although we have implemented systems and procedures intended to secure the data maintained by us, security can never be assured. Please keep in mind that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet and/or the World Wide Web. Remember, however, that any personal information you post on the internet may be available to anyone.
