**Privacy Statement for Comic Book Resources**

Boiling Point Productions has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: Comic Book Resources ( **CBR** ).

**IP Address Collection**   
The **CBR** Web site logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user's session. This gives **CBR** an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a users session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.

****CBR** 's use of Cookies**   
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. **CBR** uses cookies in only two instances - when you register as a **CBR** member and when you click an ad: 

Registration: when you register, **CBR** uses a cookie to store a unique, random user ID. 

We do not store passwords or any personal information about you. We use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and to track the pages you visit on our site.
