# Comic Book Resources: Privacy Policy

**Privacy Statement for Comic Book Resources**

Boiling Point Productions has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: Comic Book Resources ( **CBR** ). 

**IP Address Collection**   
The **CBR** Web site logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user's session. This gives **CBR** an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a users session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous. 

****CBR** 's use of Cookies**   
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. **CBR** uses cookies in only two instances - when you register as a **CBR** member and when you click an ad: 

Registration: when you register, **CBR** uses a cookie to store a unique, random user ID. 

We do not store passwords or any personal information about you. We use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and to track the pages you visit on our site. Cookies also enable you to enter **CBR** as a member without having to log on each time, and to visit member-restricted areas of the sites. We encrypt the user ID for added security. 

Ads: **CBR** 's advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates. 

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use any **CBR** site. 

**Registration Information Usage**   
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and demographic information (like their zip code or age). We use customer contact information from the registration form to contact the user for administrative purposes only (i.e. updating their passwords, sending log-in information. etc.). Users may also opt-in to receive future offers and mailiers from CBR. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

**Linking to outside content**   
This site contains links to other sites. **CBR** is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

  1. NOT collect online contact information without prior parental consent or parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity.

  2. NOT collect personally identifiable offline contact information without prior parental consent 
  3. NOT distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information with out prior parental consent

  6. NOT condition a child's participation in an acitivity on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary for the activity. 



The only personal information required of a registering user on the CBR Forums is their e-mail address. This is used only for their participation in the CBR Forums to receive e-mail notification of when a post or reply has been made to that individual user. This e-mail address is not given to third parties. When a user registers with the CBR Forums their individual IP address is collected as well. This information is only used to track that users session on the forums. Neither the e-mail address or IP address of a user under the age of 13 is disclosed to third-parties. 

Subsequent to registration by a child, a parent can review the information sent via the child prior to approval of registration. When a child registers with CBR, they are asked to fill out a form and fax it to 818-985-6688 with parental consent. At this time the parent can review the submission and make changes as necessary. 

Registration information collected from a child will be deleted upon request of the legal guardian. Contact [support@comicbookresources.com](mailto:support@comicbookresources.com) to have the information removed.
