# Privacy Policy | Comparitech

COMPARITECH LIMITED  (“COMPARITECH LIMITED”, “we” or “us”) operates the web site located at www.comparitech.com. (the “Site”). This serves as COMPARITECH LIMITED’s Privacy Policy for the Site.

COMPARITECH LIMITED makes the Site available to those individuals (“Users”) who access the Site for availability, reviews and price comparisons of internet providers, VPN services, cloud backup services and other technology services and products (“Tech Services”). Users communicate with us through the Site, respond to surveys about the usefulness and value of the Site and its contents, choose the right service for their needs, and receive other information about products and services, subject to this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”). This Policy explains what information COMPARITECH LIMITED collects about its Users, how COMPARITECH LIMITED uses and/or shares this information, and how such information is maintained. By visiting the Site, you accept the terms of this Policy.

Note that this Policy applies only with respect to the information collected by COMPARITECH LIMITED through the Site, and not any information collected or obtained through other methods or sources.

 **Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**

 **Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

COMPARITECH LIMITED also collects certain non-personally identifiable information, including the non-personally identifiable information more fully described below.

 _Cookies_. COMPARITECH LIMITED may use “cookies” on the Site. Cookies are small pieces of information that COMPARITECH LIMITED’s server places on an individual’s computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site. For example, COMPARITECH LIMITED may place a cookie on a User’s computer when he/she initially registers at the Site. The next time that User visits the Site, COMPARITECH LIMITED’s server will recognize the cookie (and the User) and allow the User to perform certain actions immediately without signing in.

While some Web browsers allow a User to automatically reject all cookies or be notified when a cookie is about to be placed on the User’s computer, disabling this feature may compromise the efficiency and added services that cookies provide.

 _IP Address_. COMPARITECH LIMITED collects your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with its server, and to administer the Site and COMPARITECH LIMITED’s email messages to Site Users. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data.

Although the information collected through the foregoing methods does not itself contain any PII, COMPARITECH LIMITED may analyze and match such information with other information that you provide (including PII) as well as information that COMPARITECH LIMITED may obtain elsewhere, and COMPARITECH LIMITED may share all or some of such information with actual or prospective distributors, dealers, or other third parties.

COMPARITECH LIMITED may also disclose non-PII in order to (1) comply with applicable laws, (2) respond to governmental inquiries, or (3) comply with valid legal process, or (4) protect the rights or property of COMPARITECH LIMITED or Users of the Site.  **Access to Information**  If you want to review, correct or change your User information, please contact us at the address listed below.
