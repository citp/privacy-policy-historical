When the Service is accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, Firefox version 2.0 or later, or Safari version 3.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology protects User Data using both server authentication and data encryption. The chat content in Comm100 Live Chat can be encrypted with SSL if the User chooses to use SSL.
