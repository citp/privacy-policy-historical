  * Comm100 Users use the Service to host data and information ("User Data"). Comm100 will NOT review, share, distribute, or reference any such User Data except required by law. 
  * User Data is collected and owned by Comm100 Users, thus the use of User Data is governed by the privacy practice of Comm100 Users instead of Comm100. This privacy policy does not cover Comm100 Users' policy on information of their website visitors and clients collected through Comm100 web sites and services. Comm100 takes no responsibility for the privacy issues of Comm100 Users. 
  * Individual records of User Data may be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of investigating an abuse complaint in Comm100 Email Marketing, resolving a problem, support issues, or suspected violation of the Comm100 Hosted Service Agreement, or as may be required by law.

  * Users are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of their Comm100 usernames and passwords. 



12\. Security

  * Comm100 uses robust security measures to protect data from unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of User Data. When the Service is accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, Firefox version 2.0 or later, or Safari version 3.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology protects User Data using both server authentication and data encryption. The chat content in Comm100 Live Chat is encrypted with SSL by default. These technologies help ensure that User Data is safe, secure, and only available to the User to whom the information belongs and those to whom the User has granted access. Comm100 also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and the Company hosts its Web sites in a secure server environment that uses firewalls and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. If you have any questions about the security of your personally identifiable information, you can contact us at [privacy@comm100.com](mailto:privacy@comm100.com).
