    <h4>Comcast is a Member of TRUSTe</h4>
    
    <p>Comcast Cable Communications, LLC is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to enable individuals and organizations to establish trusting relationships based on respect for personal identity and information by promoting the use of fair information practices. This Privacy page covers only the website www.comcast.net and the Comcast High-Speed Internet Service (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service, you expressly consent to the terms on this page as well as to those of the Comcast Customer Privacy Notice referenced above. Comcast is committed to maintaining your privacy and believes that, as a subscriber to its high-speed Internet service, you are entitled to know Comcast’s information practices. As a demonstration of our commitment to our subscribers’ privacy, Comcast has voluntarily agreed to have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
    
    <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy page, you should first contact Comcast. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or it’s not satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe through the <a class="nonboldlink" href="https://www.truste.org/pvr.php?page=complaint" target="_blank">TRUSTe Watchdog Dispute Resolution Process</a>. TRUSTe will serve as a liaison with Comcast to resolve your concerns.</p>

    <p>On this page, the terms "Comcast," "we," "us," or "our" refer to the operating company subsidiary or subsidiaries of Comcast Corporation that owns and/or operates the cable television system in your area pursuant to a cable television franchise with the local franchising authority. The term "you" refers to you as a subscriber to our high-speed Internet service.</p>
        
    <p id="specialnote"><b>Special Note:</b> The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through the Service by Comcast, and does not cover information that may be collected through software used in connection with the Service.</p>

    <h4>Provision And Transmission Of Information</h4>
    
    <p>We will not read your outgoing or incoming e-mail, video mail, private chat, or instant messages, but we (or our third party providers) do store e-mail messages and video mail messages on computer systems for a period of time. We could be required to disclose these messages and communications along with other personally identifiable information about you to comply with law or to protect our Service as described in the Comcast Customer Privacy Notice. We also monitor the performance of our Service and your Service connection in order to manage, maintain, and improve the Service and your connection to it. We (or our third party providers) use tools to help prevent and block "spam" e-mails, viruses, spyware, and other harmful or unwanted communications and programs on the Service. These tools may automatically scan your e-mails, video mails, instant messages, file attachments, and other files and communications in order to help us protect you and the Service against these harmful or unwanted communications and programs. However, these tools do not collect or disclose personally identifiable information about you. You should also be aware that any personally identifiable information you provide in forums, chat areas, instant message services, or bulletin boards may be read, collected, and used by others who access those services. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information you choose to submit in forums, chat areas, instant message services, bulletin boards, or any other publicly accessible service or website.</p>

    <h4>Third Party Advertisers</h4>    
    <p>We use third-party ad serving companies to serve certain advertisements to you when you visit this website.  These third-party ad serving companies may use anonymous information related to your visit to the Service’s website to better provide advertisements to you about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Our third-party ad serving companies do not have access to your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number unless you or others provide that information to them directly, or you consent to us providing that information. In the course of serving advertisements to this website, third-party ad serving companies may place or recognize a unique "cookie" through your browser.</p>
    <p>We may also use an advertising network provider (or providers) to help present advertisements on this website. This advertising network provider uses cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on the hard drive of your computer to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other websites you have visited. It also helps determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and in order to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, the advertising network provider collects non-personally identifiable information such as your browser type, your operating system, web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other click stream data.</p>
    <p>The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these advertising network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not Comcast’s privacy policy for this website or its Service.</p>

    <a name="software"></a>
    
    <h4>Software and Configuration</h4>
    
    <p>Comcast uses information that you provide to Comcast’s support software to assist you with technical support for the use of the Service. When you make use of the Comcast supplied support software and forward a request for assistance or choose to chat with a technical support representative, the support software records certain information relating to the request and interaction. You have the choice to provide any information to the support software or a support representative, and you have the ability to confirm your decision before sending any information to our systems. The information collected by the support software is limited to the hardware and software configurations of your computer systems and to any e-mails you send or discussions you type during a live support session. This information is available only to authorized personnel for maintaining and supporting the use of the Service. Comcast also provides customer contact and support pages on the Service that you can use to communicate with Comcast about technical support. Comcast uses the information provided by you on these pages to support your use of the Service Comcast may also offer or provide software directly or though third parties for your use in connection with the Service. For example, we may provide software you can use for security, search, parental controls, digital photographs, gaming, instant messaging, and video e-mails. These programs may be subject to their own terms of service and other policies. You should carefully read their terms and policies to understand how they may use personally identifiable information about you.</p>
    <p>In certain cases, at your request or with or without prior notice to you, Comcast may configure your Service or Service-related equipment to resolve a technical support issue or otherwise render or deliver the Service. Comcast may perform these configurations remotely over the cable network and/or the Internet.</p>
    
    <a name="preferences"></a>
    
    <h4>Preferences</h4>
    
    <p>We store information that you provide to personalize your settings on the Service so that you don’t have to change these settings each time you use the Service. We do not share your preferences with third parties except for service providers or other third parties who may provide certain components of the Service.</p>
    
    <a name="cookies"></a>
    
    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    
    <p>Cookies are small files stored on a computer’s hard drive to simplify and improve a user’s Web experience. A website may store information in a cookie about your computer configuration so that it can more efficiently provide information to you the next time you visit the site. Or, your browser program might save a cookie with your username and password so that a website’s server will automatically recognize you the next time you access the site.</p>
    <p>Comcast uses cookies, among other things, to remember your username and password, if you choose to store them, from the home page of the Service at www.comcast.net, as well as to remember some of your personalization preferences and Service plan features. Comcast does not store your name or other personal information in cookies.</p>
    <p>Some of our business relationships are with vendors who may use cookies (for example, search engines or network advertising providers) or in connection with their own advertisers and other business partners. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. For more information about how these vendors and their business partners use cookies, and how you may be able to "opt-out" of those cookies, read the privacy policy that applies to each vendor’s website. This policy covers the use of cookies by Comcast on the www.comcast.net website only; it does not cover the use of cookies by any other party or website unless stated otherwise.</p>
    
    <a name="logs"></a>
    
    <h4>Log Files and Website and E-mail Management</h4>
    
    <p>Like many websites, the Service’s website servers use log files. These logs record aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information about site usage such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, Internet service providers, referring/exit pages, pages accessed, platform types, date/time stamps, times of use, and numbers of clicks, for example. This information is necessary to analyze trends, administer the Service’s website, balance web traffic, evaluate users’ electronic browsing in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information except as may be required to comply with law and as described in the Comcast Customer Privacy Notice.</p>
    <p>We use a software technology called Web Bugs (also known as Web Beacons/clear gifs) with the log files for the Service’s website www.comcast.net. These Web Bugs are usually 1 by 1 pixel invisible images on our website’s pages. When a user visits one of these Web pages, the user’s browser contacts our Web servers and creates an entry in the log for the website www.comcast.net. These entries do not use personally identifiable information and they provide us with more accurate website visit and session information in the log files. We also use clear gifs on the Service’s website to help format graphic elements.</p>
    <p>We (or our third party providers) also use clear gifs in some of the e-mails that we send to you as described in this Policy. These clear gifs (also known as e-mail sensors) are small invisible images included in HTML-based e-mails. These clear gifs have two functions. First, they determine whether an e-mail recipient has opened a particular e-mail. This helps us improve the wording of subject lines and content as well as determine readership levels. Second, they determine whether an e-mail recipient is capable of receiving an HTML-based e-mail. This helps us customize e-mail content and improve your overall customer experience. Comcast owns the information collected by using e-mail sensors, and our third party providers are obligated to keep this information confidential and not share this information with anyone else or use it for any other purpose. If you do not want to receive e-mails that use e-mail sensors, you can set up your e-mail program so that it does not accept HTML-based e-mail, and instead uses only plain text format for e-mail.</p>
    
    <a name="links"></a>
    
    <h4>Links</h4>
    <p>The Service’s website contains links to other sites. Some of these other sites may be co-branded with Comcast and may look like Service features, but Comcast is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our website and to read the privacy policies of every website that collects personally identifiable information about you, whether the site is co-branded with Comcast or not.</p>
    
    <a name="security"></a>
    
    <h4>Security</h4>
    
    <p>In no case will Comcast or one of our authorized service providers ask you for your password in an e-mail or over the telephone. Do not give your password to anyone in an e-mail or over the telephone.</p>
    
    <a name="children"></a>
    
    <h4>Special Note about Children</h4>
    
    <p>The Service is not directed to children under the age of 13, and Comcast does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18 on the Service unless expressly specified on the appropriate pages of the Service website. However, some pages of the Service website may be of interest to children. On those pages, Comcast or its service providers will provide a special notice or other information describing any additional privacy protections that may apply. Children should always get permission from a parent or legal guardian before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else.</p>
