<strong>A. Personally-Identifiable Information:</strong><br>
Commission-Cash-Code.com typically receives specific data about its website visitors only when such information is provided voluntarily, such as when our visitors request information, purchase or enroll for services, open a customer support inquiry ticket, provide resume information for
employment opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course, some of these activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a purchase, use a credit card to pay for services,
submit your resume, or request certain types of information. When you provide personally- identifiable information to Commission-Cash-Code.com through one of our websites, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. In most cases, you will be given the opportunity to select whether you do, or do not, want Commission-Cash-Code.com to use this information for additional purposes. You may also request that Commission-Cash-Code.com not use your information by sending an e-mail to admin@Commission-Cash-Code.com , however, Commission-Cash-Code.com reserves the right, in its discretion, to send you bulletins and other important information about your Commission-Cash-Code.com services.
