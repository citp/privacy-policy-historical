# ComputerJobs.com - About Us - Privacy

   **INFORMATION COLLECTION**

For all processes that require information collection, ComputerJobs.com is committed to providing the highest level of security and privacy for IT professionals and employers. 

We use various methods to collect information on our site, such as registration forms, contests, surveys, request forms, contact us, and mail-to's. These registration forms are linked to ComputerJobs.com mailing lists and require users to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this contact information to send users information about our company and its products and services. The information may also be used to contact site visitors by email for marketing purposes. Registered users can opt-out of receiving email marketing communications through the opt-out function available in each email message delivered from ComputerJobs.com. Once a user has completed the opt-out process, they will be removed from ComputerJobs.com email marketing mailing list. 

ComputerJobs.com collects system-related information, such as IP address, browser type, and operating system type, and uses it for system administration purposes. This information helps diagnose problems with our servers, monitor traffic patterns, and site usage. System information also assists us in identifying the most popular areas of our site, so we can continue to deliver content that is important and relevant to our users.
