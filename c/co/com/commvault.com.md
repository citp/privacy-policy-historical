# Privacy Policy | Commvault

Commvault understands the importance of protecting personal information and complying with data protection laws. Please read our [Privacy Charter](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy/privacy-charter) that underlies our approach. 

This Privacy Policy provides information for our customers, partners, suppliers and other individuals and organisations that we may have a business relationship with about how we collect, use and share personal information. Our products and services are not directed at children.

Commvault will use your personal information based on:

  * **Contract** : Where it is necessary in connection with a product or service we are providing to you

A clear request for your consent will be presented to you and you will have the ability to withdraw your consent at any time.
