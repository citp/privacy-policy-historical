<p><strong><a name="5"></a>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicating with you</strong></p>
<p>It is very important to us that we provide a service that meets the expectations of our customers. In order to assist us in doing this, where you have given us consent, we may use the information you supply to contact you by phone, e-mail, SMS or otherwise to tell you about products and services which may be of interest to you. For example, these services could include the following:</p>
<p>- Our newsletter;</p>
<p>- New product launches;</p>
<p>- Reminders about our service in 11 months time;</p>
<p>- Future surveys/research.</p>
<p>When given permission to do so, we may also share personal information about you with our trusted partners. If you prefer to opt out of such direct marketing activity, please click <a href="https://quote.comparethemarket.com/PrivateCar/Common/Pages/Unsubscribe.aspx?affinity=CTM&amp;affclie=CM01&amp;Origin=CM02&amp;affclie=CM01">here</a> or <a href="http://www.comparethemarket.com/contact-us/" target="_blank">contact us</a> using our simple form.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will also be given an opportunity to opt out when we send you any marketing emails by clicking on the unsubscribe link in each email.</p>
<p>However, please remember that by opting out, we will not be able to contact you about products or services that may benefit you.</p>
<p>For car and home insurance quotes, where you have provided your telephone number, the two providers who offer you the best price may contact you to discuss your quote further.</p>
<p>We may also contact you around 11 months after you have completed your quote in order to provide you with an indication of what your quotes could be for your next renewal. We will use the data that we hold on you in order to search the websites of our partners in order to do this. Some of our partners will carry out credit and data checks as part of this process (see paragraph 6 below for further information on the types of checks that may be undertaken).</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="6"></a>6. Credit and data checks</strong></p>
<p>Some of our product and service providers will carry out checks with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies in order to verify your identity, assess your application for a quotation or credit and offer you the best terms.&nbsp; The checks may be against both public data (such as information from the electoral roll) and private data (such as your credit history) The providers do not make these checks purely because you are using our service, and may make them if you request a quote via any other source. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A record of the search will appear on your credit report. &nbsp;Some product providers may also carry out checks against data they already hold on you (or is held by the company whose brand they administer the product for, or members of their group of companies) such as data from existing products, account data or loyalty scheme data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They may use this data to help them assess and rate your application for a quote and determine your premiums.&nbsp; They may also pass this data to their insurance underwriters for these purposes where applicable.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="7"></a>7.&nbsp;Crime and fraud prevention</strong></p>
<p>We may share data with third parties including our product and service providers or the police and fraud prevention agencies if we believe that it is reasonably required for the prevention or detection of crime or fraud or to protect our customers.&nbsp;Data may also be released to third parties if we are required to do so under the terms of a court order.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="8"></a>8.&nbsp;Sensitive personal data</strong></p>
<p>In order to provide you with a quote we may need to collect personal data which the Data Protection Act 1998 defines as sensitive, such as medical history or criminal convictions. By proceeding with obtaining a quote you will signify your explicit consent to such information being processed by ourselves and our product or service providers for the purposes stated above.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="9"></a>9. Overseas transfer of data</strong></p>
<p>From time to time it may be necessary for us to undertake some of the processing of your personal data in other countries outside of the European Economic Area where data protection safeguards are not as high as they are in the UK. However, where this is necessary we will ensure that your data is kept securely and only processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act. &nbsp;&nbsp;It is also possible that some of our product and service providers will process your data in other countries, however we require all our partners to ensure that your data is kept securely at all times.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="10"></a>10.&nbsp;Product / service providers websites</strong></p>
<p>We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites. Whenever possible we will only partner with other websites which maintain the same standards as are present on our own website but we cannot guarantee this. If you click through to any of our product or service providers to their own website, you will be subject to that product or service provider’s website terms and conditions and privacy policy which we would recommend you read carefully.</p>

					<p>We work with almost all of the UK's top providers to find you the best deals. We charge partners a fee to appear on <a href="http://www.comparethemarket.com/">comparethemarket.com</a> and our searches don't include every single provider in the market – a very small number opt out of all comparison sites and others do not meet the strict partner criteria we use to protect our customers.</p>

					<h3>The best deals</h3>
					<p>Most people use comparison websites to get the best deal they can, which is why we’ll never send you irrelevant ‘special deals’. All we do is compare the market for you.&nbsp;</p>
