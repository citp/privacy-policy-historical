## Privacy Policy

The Comedy Festival is bound at all times by the National Privacy Principles ("NPPs") which are contained in the Privacy Act 1988, and as ammended by the Privacy Ammendment (Private Sector) Act 2001.

On some parts of this website you are requested to submit some personal information. Depending on the context, which ought to be clear, we might want this information:

  * so we can email or post you Festival information, like a Programme.
  * as part of a registration for an event, like Raw Comedy.
  * to respond to your questions



If you don't understand why you're being asked for information, telephone us on +613 9245 3700

You can contact us anytime by phone, post or email to ascertain, correct, or remove this information from our records. If you can correctly, independently verify three individual contact details from our records, we'll assume you really are you, and follow your instructions. We won't discuss any details before we've done so.

From time to time, we may also collect information anonymously from your internet server. This is commonly done all over the internet, using things called "cookies". We may store:

  * the last site you visited before us
  * the kind of browser you are using
  * what country you are connected in
  * the date and time of your visit
  * your movements around pages on the site



These cookies don't "remember" you, or identify you personally. We only use the information they give us in aggregate.

We don't give this information to anyone else - not sponsors, not governments, not independent producers in the Festival. Only Festival staff and contractors and co-producers (in the case of things like Raw). We make our contractors and co-producers agree to these principles, here, as well.
