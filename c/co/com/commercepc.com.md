# Commerce Bank Serving Central PA - Privacy Policy

This notice provides detail about the information we collect and disclose, and explains how we handle privacy as it relates to you and your accounts. 

**Our Commitment To You**  
We want you to know that your relationship with us is treated with the confidentiality that you expect and deserve. Trust, privacy, and confidentiality are the guiding principles upon which commerce's relationship with you is built. Because we are committed to serving the needs of our customers, we will take all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of their relationship with us. 

**Protecting Customer Information**  
Access to your personal information is limited to those Commerce employees who need to know the information to provide products and services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect your nonpublic information. 

**What You Can Do To Protect Your Financial Information**  


  * Routinely review and reconcile your account statements. 
  * If you become aware of incorrect information either in our records or as reported by Commerce, please notify us at 1-888-YES-0004 and we will promptly make the necessary corrections. 
  * Safeguard and protect your account records and other information pertaining to your relationship with Commerce. 
  * Remember that cellular, mobile, and cordless phones are not secure. Neither is electronic mail (e-mail); regard it as you would a postcard. 

**Information We Collect**  
We collect nonpublic personal information about you to help serve your financial needs, provide customer service, offer new products or services, and fulfill legal and regulatory requirements. These types of nonpublic personal information may include: 

  * Information we received from you on loan applications or other forms. 
  * Information about your transactions with Commerce, our affiliates, or others. 
  * Information from outside companies or third parties (i.e.credit bureaus) such as motor vehicle reports and demographic information. 

We collect only the information necessary to deliver quality products and services to our customers. 

**Information We Share**  
We are permitted by law to share nonpublic information about you to outside companies or non-affiliated third parties who participate with us in supplying products and services to customers such as check printing and credit bureaus. 

These nonaffiliated third party companies are not permitted to use our customer information for any purposes other than the services intended. We will share your information with these companies only if they agree to treat it confidentially. 

The type of information we may share is: 

  * Information we receive from you on loan applications or other forms, such as name, address, social security number, assets and income. 
  * Information about transactions with Commerce, such as account balances and payment history. 

We do not sell, rent or otherwise provide customer information to outside companies so they can market non-financial services to you. Commerce may make a decision to sell a particular line of business (for example, mortgage servicing rights). Usually, an integral part of that business is its customer database. Commerce reserves the right, in circumstances such as these, to transfer ownership of such customer databases to the purchaser. We do not share any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law. 

**Accuracy of Information**  
If you believe we have reported inaccurate information about your account to any consumer reporting agency, please let us know in writing. Be sure to include your complete name, current address, social security number, telephone number, account number, type of account, specific item of dispute, and the reason you believe the information is wrong. Please notify us and we will make the necessary corrections promptly. Send your notice to: 

Commerce Bank  
Attn: Customer Service Department

Camp Hill, PA 17011
