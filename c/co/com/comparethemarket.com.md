**4. Provision of services and disclosure of data**

We will use the information provided to us by you to search the websites of our partners in order to obtain the best quotes available to you.

We may use your data to send you a confirmation email of your quote.

To help improve our services we may also use your data for the purposes of marketing research and data analysis.

Data will also be used to track sales and to administer our reward scheme.  Please read the Privacy & Cookie Policy for [www.comparethemeerkat.com](http://www.comparethemeeerkat.com/) which contains further details regarding the reward scheme.   

We may use third parties to process personal information on our behalf. Where third parties process your personal information on our behalf, we will ensure that they have the necessary high standards of security in place so that your data is kept secure and only used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.   

We will release your personal information when we are required to do so for legal or regulatory purposes or as part of legal proceedings.

Driving Licence Number

If you provide your driving licence number this may be passed to the DVLA in order for a search to be carried out to confirm your (or any named driver’s) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. Searches may be carried out as part of your quote and at any point throughout the duration of your insurance policy. A search with the DVLA will not show on your (or your named driver’s) driving licence record. For details relating to information held about you by the DVLA, please visit [www.dvla.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency). Undertaking searches using your driving licence number helps insurers check information to prevent fraud and reduce incidences of negligent misrepresentation and non-disclosure. The searches may be carried out by the insurers directly or we may carry out the search and pass the relevant information to the insurers for these purposes. This is a new scheme which is being rolled out. If you provide your driving licence number before the scheme is operational, we will keep your driving licence so that it may be used for future quotes.

**5.   Communicating with you**

It is very important to us that we provide a service that meets the expectations of our customers. In order to assist us in doing this, where you have given us consent, we may use the information you supply to contact you by phone, e-mail, SMS or otherwise to tell you about products and services which may be of interest to you. For example, these services could include the following:

\- Our newsletter;

\- New product launches;

\- Reminders about our service in 11 months time;

\- Future surveys/research.

When given permission to do so, we may also share personal information about you with our trusted partners. If you prefer to opt out of such direct marketing activity, please click [here](https://quote.comparethemarket.com/PrivateCar/Common/Pages/Unsubscribe.aspx?affinity=CTM&affclie=CM01&Origin=CM02&affclie=CM01) or [contact us](http://www.comparethemarket.com/contact-us/) using our simple form.   You will also be given an opportunity to opt out when we send you any marketing emails by clicking on the unsubscribe link in each email.

However, please remember that by opting out, we will not be able to contact you about products or services that may benefit you.

For car and home insurance quotes, where you have provided your telephone number, the two providers who offer you the best price may contact you to discuss your quote further.

We may also contact you around 11 months after you have completed your quote in order to provide you with an indication of what your quotes could be for your next renewal. We will use the data that we hold on you in order to search the websites of our partners in order to do this. Some of our partners will carry out credit and data checks as part of this process (see paragraph 6 below for further information on the types of checks that may be undertaken).

**6\. Credit and data checks**

Some of our product and service providers will carry out checks with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies in order to verify your identity, assess your application for a quotation or credit and offer you the best terms.  The checks may be against both public data (such as information from the electoral roll) and private data (such as your credit history) The providers do not make these checks purely because you are using our service, and may make them if you request a quote via any other source. As part of the quote process, some product providers will exchange information with various industry databases in order to verify the information that you have provided such as the Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE), the Hunter Database, the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register or  the No Claims Discount Database.

A record of the search will appear on your credit report. Some product providers may also carry out checks against data they already hold on you (or is held by the company whose brand they administer the product for, or members of their group of companies) such as data from existing products, account data or loyalty scheme data. They may use this data to help them assess and rate your application for a quote and determine your premiums.  They may also pass this data to their insurance underwriters for these purposes where applicable.

**7. Crime and fraud prevention**

We may share data (including electronic identifiers such as IP addresses) with third parties including our product and service providers or the police and fraud prevention agencies if we believe that it is reasonably required for the prevention or detection of crime or fraud or to protect our customers. Data may also be released to third parties if we are required to do so under the terms of a court order.

**8. Sensitive personal data**

In order to provide you with a quote we may need to collect personal data which the Data Protection Act 1998 defines as sensitive, such as medical history or criminal convictions. By proceeding with obtaining a quote you will signify your explicit consent to such information being processed by ourselves and our product or service providers for the purposes stated above. ** **

However, where this is necessary we will ensure that your data is kept securely and only processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act.   It is also possible that some of our product and service providers will process your data in other countries, however we require all our partners to ensure that your data is kept securely at all times.
