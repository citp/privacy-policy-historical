# Privacy Policy | Comedy Central UK

Updated: 4th December 2019

At The Paramount UK Partnership (the corporate name for the business which runs Comedy Central in the UK), we take your privacy seriously and are committed to ensuring that we protect the information you entrust to us. We created this Privacy Policy to tell you what personal information The Paramount UK Partnership collects about you, how we use, store and share it, and your rights and choices concerning that information. This Privacy Policy applies to all information about you that we collect, whether you are visiting our websites, using one of our mobile apps or other products or services, or otherwise interacting with us, such as by attending a live event, or contacting customer service. This policy collectively refers to these touchpoints as the "Services." While some of the information we describe here is technical, our goal is to make this policy straightforward, so please contact us if you have any questions.

We will change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will revise the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, will notify you through the Services, such as via our homepage, email, or other communication.
