On joining that other community your user profile information will be automatically transferred by Social Project to that other community.

Please note that the use of your information by the operator of that community (which may be in a different country) will be subject its privacy policy (which you should review) and shall be governed by the local laws of its country and we shall have no responsibility for this.

Your member profiles within the Social Project Network are public (unless made private) as are postings to any of our communities which can be indexed by third-party search engines and appear in search results on third-party web sites. You should therefore exercise caution when disclosing information in your profile or elsewhere on any of our communities.
