We have strict limitations about what personal information can be viewed about kids under 13 and how and when they can be contacted.

We do not share your personal information with any third parties unless it is to fulfill a request (ie enter a promotion, etc.) you have made on the Common Sense Media website.

We may share limited information with law enforcement officials in order to keep the Common Sense Media community safe.

**COMMON SENSE MEDIA PRIVACY POLICY**  
Effective Date of Policy: June 1, 2010

This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) explains how we collect, protect, use, and share information obtained through the Common Sense Media website, [www.commonsensemedia.org](http://www.commonsensemedia.org/) (the “Site”), which is operated by Common Sense Media, Inc. (“we” or “us”). Except as expressly provided in this policy, we will never share any personally identifiable information about you without your prior written consent.

We hope this information increases your confidence in Common Sense Media and enhances your experience on our Site. Please see our separate [Terms of Use](http://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/our-mission/terms-use) which governs the use of the Site. We encourage you to read this Policy before using the Site, and not to use the Site if you disagree with any part of this Policy. By using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy.

The Site is controlled and operated by a non-profit organization in the United States, and is not intended to subject Common Sense Media or any affiliated entity to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. We may limit the Site’s availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time in our sole discretion.

**I. INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT ON THE SITE**

Through the Site, you can be a part of an active and vibrant community of families interested in the impact of media on their children. Visitors who complete the membership process through our Site may become registered members (“Members”). Members can engage in a full range of activities on our Site, such as posting on our message boards and blogs, creating user reviews and a personal profile, participating in surveys and polls, and participating in other online activities such as rating media and writing to media producers. If you are not currently a Member, you may [click here](http://www.commonsensemedia.org/user/register) to register and become eligible for all of our Site's features.

**A. Personally Identifiable Information**

In this Privacy Policy, when we use the term "Personally Identifiable Information", we mean any information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual. We collect different types of Personally Identifiable Information depending whether you are a Non-Member or a Member, as explained below. For information on the collection, use and disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of thirteen (13), please see “Children’s Privacy” below.

All visitors to the Site, including Non-Members, may register to receive e newsletters by providing their name and email address. We also may collect Personally Identifiable Information through surveys or questionnaires. Your participation in surveys and questionnaires is entirely voluntary.

If you wish to become a Member, you must provide us with certain Personally Identifiable Information as part of the registration process, including first name, screen name, password, password hint and answer, e mail address, zip code, and birth month and year. The screen name would identify you on the Site. For instance, your screen name would be included in your profile that is viewable to other Members and would be displayed with reviews you write. Since the screen name is viewable to others, we suggest that you NOT use your real name for your screen name or your password, in order to protect your privacy.

Our Members have the opportunity to connect with other Members whom they might not otherwise meet. If you are a Member, you may choose to provide other types of information about yourself and your family, such as number and age of your children or a photograph of yourself, in the profile that is available to other Members.

If you decide that you no longer want to be a Member, please [contact us](http://www.commonsensemedia.org/contact), and your name and profile will be removed from our Site. Personally Identifiable Information and other data that you furnished through the Site may remain in our records, even if you are no longer a Member, and can be used by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE IN YOUR PROFILE OR ON THE SITE.

We use a third-party service provider, Groundspring.org (the "Payment Service"), to handle donations made by credit card and other payment transactions submitted to our Site. If you wish to make a donation through the Site, you will be directed to a webpage that is hosted by the Payment Service (or its service providers) and not by us (such page, the "Payment Service Page"). Any PII that you provide through the Payment Service Page will be collected by the Payment Service rather than by us, and will be subject to the Payment Service's privacy policy (located at [www.groundspring.org/privacypolicy.cfm](http://www.groundspring.org/privacypolicy.cfm)) rather than this Policy. We have no control over, and shall not be responsible for, the Payment Service's use of information collected through the Payment Service Page. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION THROUGH THE PAYMENT SERVICE PAGE OR THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF THE PAYMENT SERVICE.

**B. Cookies and Other Technologies**

We may also collect certain information automatically when you visit the Site, such as the browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer 6.0, Mozilla Firefox 1.5, etc.), the internet address from which you linked to our Site, the operating system of your computer (e.g., Microsoft Windows), the unique IP address of the computer you used to access our Site and usage and browsing habits. We use this information to administer and improve your experience on our Site, to help diagnose and troubleshoot potential server malfunctions, and to gather broad demographic information.

To help make sure you receive information that is relevant to you, our Site uses data "cookies." These cookies are small data files stored on your computer which identify you as a previous visitor to the Site and help us to personalize your experience when you arrive. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. You can instruct your browser not to accept cookies. However, if you disable this function, you will not be able to use some of the features on our Site. For example, if you do not accept cookies, you will not be able to sign in to our Site.

Our Web pages and our e-mail newsletters may contain "web beacons." Web beacons allow us to count users that have visited a web page or opened an email that contains a web beacon and collect other types of information. Using this information, we are able to measure the effectiveness of our content and how visitors use our Site. This allows us to learn what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which parts of our Site are the most interesting and what kind of offers our visitors like to see.

**C. Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses, and other information that does not reveal a person’s specific identity. We may collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (e.g., interests, geographic location, zip codes, etc.) when you voluntarily provide such information to us, such as through survey responses. Such information constitutes Non-Personally Identifiable Information because, unless combined with your name or other Personally Identifiable Information, it does not personally identify you or any other user.

Additionally, we may aggregate Personally Identifiable Information in a manner such that the end product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site. For example, we might use Personally Identifiable Information to calculate the percentage of our Members who have a particular zip code. Such aggregate information is considered Non-Personally Identifiable Information for purposes of this Policy.

**II. HOW WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THE SITE**

**A. How We Use Personally Identifiable Information**

We use Personally Identifiable Information to process requests made through our Site, such as requests to receive our e-newsletters, requests for membership, and questions or comments submitted through our Site.

Common Sense Media will not have control of any Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to the Corporate Partner when you accept the offer.

Refer a Friend. If you become a Member, you can refer other individuals to join by providing us with their first names and email addresses (the “Referral Information”). We would use this information to send them an email invitation to join Common Sense Media. Any Personally Identifiable Information you provide as part of a referral may be disclosed to your friend, such as your own name and email address.

**IV. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**

Our Site provides a forum for all family members, including children, to express their views about movies, books, TV, games, web sites, and music. While we encourage children to participate appropriately in the Site, the privacy of children’s information is extremely important to us. This section of our Policy explains how we collect, use and disclose Personally Identifiable Information and other information from children under the age of 13

**A. How We Collect and Use Information from Children**

Children can explore the Site, view and print content without providing any Personally Identifiable Information. In general, our Site only collects Personally Identifiable Information about a child if the child registers to become a member of our Site or submits a question or request to us.

Site Registration Process. If a child registers to become a member of our Site, we require the child to submit the following information:

• First name  
• Screen name (the child is advised not to use his or her real name);  
• Password;  
• Zip code;  
• E-mail address; and  
• Birth month and year.

If the birth month and year indicate that the child is under thirteen years of age, we also require the child to provide a parent’s name and e-mail address. We use the parent’s email address to notify the parent that his or her child has registered with our Site, as explained below.

We may use information collected from children during the Site registration process in the following manner:

• We may use this information (such as screen name and password) to create and maintain the child’s account on our Site;  
• We use the child’s email address on a one-time basis to send the child a message confirming the creation of his or her account on our Site. We also keep the child’s email address for internal record-keeping purposes, although we do not use the child’s email address to send e-newsletters, surveys, or similar communications  
• We use the zip code for purposes of aggregated statistics, as discussed under Section I.C above.  
• We use the child’s birth month/year to determine whether the child is younger than thirteen years of age. If the child is under the age of thirteen, we use the parent’s email address to send the parent a one-time notification that the child has registered to become a member of our Site.

User Profile. If a child registers on our Site, the child may choose to complete a user profile. The profile allows the child, like other members, to enter comments about household rules, hobbies or interests, and challenges. The child also may choose to upload a photograph to his or her profile.

Reviews and Other Site Activities. Additionally, the child may choose to write and post reviews on the Site, such as reviews of movies, games, web sites, TV, books and music Children also may participate in other Site activities, such as posting on our message boards and blogs, participating in surveys and polls, and participating in other online activities such as rating media and writing to media producers.

Responding to a Child’s Question or Request. If a child sends us a question or request, we may use the child’s email address or other Personally Identifiable Information provided by the child for purposes of responding to that one-time request.

**B. What Information Submitted By Children Is Viewable On the Site?**

We strictly limit the information that is publicly viewable about a member who is known to be a child under the age of thirteen. When a child under the age of 13 posts a review on the Site, the child’s screen name, age, and the photograph (if any) uploaded by the child to his or her profile may be viewable on the Site, along with the content of the child’s posting. Although the child may create a profile for his or her account, no portion of the child’s profile other than the child’s screen name, age, and uploaded photograph would be viewable except to CSM’s employees and service providers or other agents.

**C. What Information About Children Is Shared?**

We do not disclose any Personally Identifiable Information collected from children to any third parties other than (a) with a parent’s written permission, (b) as required by any applicable law, or (c) to our service providers as permitted by applicable law.

**D. How May Parents Raise Questions or Concerns?**

If a parent has any questions or concerns about his or her child’s participation in the Site, the parent is encouraged to contact us at [privacy@commonsensemedia.org](mailto:privacy@commonsensemedia.org), or write to us at the address provided below.
