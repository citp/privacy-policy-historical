CompuSystems processes data on behalf of event organizers. Specifically, CompuSystems collects and processes event registrant information and provides lead retrieval services to trade show exhibitors. CompuSystems does not share registrant data without event organizer permission. However, we reserve the right to share registrant information when required by subpoena, court order, applicable law, governmental statute, regulation or other legal process. Additionally, we may share this information when we have a good faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to prevent or respond to fraud, defend our websites, mobile applications or other services against attacks, or protect our property and security, or our customers and users.

The following is our privacy policy as it pertains to these two customer segments:

**Meeting, Convention & Trade Show Registrants**

We have taken a number of steps to assure the protection of personal or confidential information sent to or from us.

First, as it pertains to online transactions, we require that a secure session be established. This is done any time registrants supply or access personal or confidential information in one of our online areas. This technology creates a private conversation that only the communicating computers understand, ensuring that the transmitted information remains confidential. Specifically, when registrants access pages requesting or presenting financial or personal data, we utilize 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to prevent others from accessing it while in transit. Most browsers display a padlock icon in the bottom right-hand corner when SSL is being used on a secure page.

Second, many areas of our registration websites require the use of a registrant user ID and password as an additional security measure to protect against unauthorized access to account information.

_How We Use The Information We Collect From Our Registration Customers:_

Third, in order to bring our customers certain services offered through our websites, we work with trusted non-affiliated companies. If we have to share any personal information with these companies in order to provide a product or service, we take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure these companies protect this information, which may include requiring they complete questionnaires and/or take other evaluative measures of their information and security systems, safeguards, and practices prior to selection as a business partner. These measures may also include implementing contractual provisions to ensure the security and confidentiality of  customer information. In some cases, we may also audit these companies to verify the continued security of their systems and practices.
