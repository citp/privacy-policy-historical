**Usage of visitor profiles and cookies

We may use cookies and other similar technologies (for example, web beacons) either on their own or in conjunction with your registered user profile to:

  * provide you with access to services that require you to be a logged-in, registered user (for example, our premium content service);
  * monitor what content we have served you, so that, for example, we can prevent you from seeing certain advertisements or surveys more than once;
  * help us to match the advertisements, related content and other content that we show you more closely to the content you have chosen to view while on our site, or to the profile you have registered with us;
  * prevent you from voting or submitting results more than once in a poll, survey, or competition;
  * keep you logged in to our site throughout a session so that you do not have to log in repeatedly;
  * monitor how the site is used, to aid our strategic development plans so that we can improve our services to you (see web activity reporting, below);
  * build up marketing profiles for the site;
  * help manage and maintain our relationship with our advertisers;
  * audit the usage of the site.



**Personal details**

If you register with any of the services on our site that require registration (for example, our premium content service, email newsletter registration, the jobs service, magazine and digital magazine subscription forms, and competitions), we will use your contact details and other information provided by you in order to provide you with any services requested by you and also to tell you about important changes to the site and the services that you have requested. Your details will be stored and processed in the UK.

Contact details will also be used by us and by other businesses within Reed Business Information Limited and its associated companies to provide you with information about other services and products, unless you specify otherwise by means of the registration form at the time of registering, or later, by editing your profile. Details may also be disclosed to third party businesses and advertisers for the same purposes - again, you may opt out of such contact by editing your preferences on the profile page at, or after, registration.

If you do not wish to be contacted for these purposes, please [log in and indicate your preferences on the profile page at ComputerWeekly.com](https://www.computerweekly.com/profile/main).

**Web activity reporting**

In order to help us to improve our service, we use cookies and third-party software to gather information about how our users navigate around through the site. At present, our analytics providers are Google Analytics, HitBox (owned by Omniture), and Trovus. You can find individual privacy policies for two of these products here ([Google Privacy Center](http://www.google.com/privacy.html)) and here ([Omniture Privacy Statement](http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/product)).

**Statistical information**

From time to time we provide aggregate statistical information to our advertisers and other partners, typically regarding website usage patterns. This statistical information does not include personally identifying information.

**Commercial advertising**

The advertisements on our site are served using the AdTech, Grapeshot, DoubleClick and Firstlight advertising platforms. You can find their privacy statements here ([AdTech Privacy Policy](http://www.adtech.com/privacy/)) and here ([Grapeshot Privacy](http://www.grapeshot.co.uk/privacy.html)), and [Firstlight's website here](http://www.firstlightera.com/site/index.html).

**Jobs service, profile and CV information**

If you are registered with our jobs service, please also see the [Jobs Service Privacy Policy](http://www.reedbusiness.co.uk/rb2_terms/rb2_privacy.htm) for further information.

**Email newsletters and web beacons**

Our email newsletters include a small transparent image, or 'beacon', that lets us know whether or not the emails we send out are being opened. This helps us to improve the service we offer, contact you about changes to your newsletter subscriptions and provide aggregated statistical information to advertisers about readership levels.

By downloading images when you open the newsletter you will activate the beacon; if you do not wish to do this you can choose either not to download images in emails from us, or to receive all emails as plain text, by amending the settings and rules within your email client. However, this will also mean that you will be unable to see any pictorial or multimedia content contained within the newsletters

**Third-party usage of data**

We may disclose your information to business partners and to third-party suppliers that we have engaged to provide services requiring the processing of data on our behalf, successors in title to our business, or in accordance with a properly executed court order, or as otherwise required to do so by law. We reserve the right to fully co-operate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requiring or requesting us to disclose the identity or other usage details of any user of our sites.

**Access to data**

You have the right to be told what personal information we hold about you on our databases. You should write to us, Reedbusiness.co.uk Update.net at Reed Business Information, Quadrant House, Sutton, Surrey, SM2 5AS, UK stating your full name, your address and all publications or services from RBI to which you know you subscribe. A small administrative charge will be made for fulfilling this request.
