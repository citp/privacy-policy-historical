Our online market research community has millions of participants who are interested in voicing their opinions through their survey responses and activities, as described below, and in influencing which products and services are offered. Panelists allow their digital consumption behavior to be collected and used to produce a variety of reports about consumers' preferences and interests.**

The information you contribute is used by Comscore, a globally-recognized authority on market research and cross-platform consumption behavior trends, whose data are routinely cited by major media outlets such as The New York Times®, The Wall Street Journal®, and CNN®.

Please note that these consumer rights and definition of “personal information” vary by jurisdiction.

We provide the right to access and delete personal information, subject to certain exceptions. To exercise your choices about your personal information, including choices which may not be listed above, please visit our [**Data Subject Rights Page**](https://www.comscore.com/About/General-Data-Protection-Regulation-GDPR/Data-Subject-Rights?cs_edgescape_cc=US). You may also contact us by email at **[privacy@comscore.com](mailto:privacy@comscore.com)**

If you would like to submit a request to opt out of the sale of your personal information, you may also exercise your right on our [**Data Subject Rights Page**](https://www.comscore.com/About/General-Data-Protection-Regulation-GDPR/Data-Subject-Rights?cs_edgescape_cc=US).

We may need to request additional information from you to verify your identity (e.g., your email address, cookie identifier, machine identifier, and/or device identifier) or understand the scope of your request.

#### Interest-based advertising and market research

 **What is interest-based advertising?  **

Interest-based advertising, also known as Online Behavioral Advertising, allows advertisers to display ads tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as ad delivery, reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.

We may use third parties and service providers on our Websites, as discussed in the **What information is collected and why**  section, to collect information for interest-based advertising. This process may involve third parties and services providers using tagging technology, such as a cookie, on your device. These tags may collect data about your Web browsing over time and across digital properties, including information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices. We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles in connection to all interest-based advertising activities.

The information collected from ScorecardResearch tags is used for interest-based advertising purposes, where appropriate. Please note interest-based advertising services based on information collected by ScorecardResearch are not provided in the European Union (“EU”).

#### How do I manage my preference for interest-based advertising?

You may visit  [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) to learn more about interest-based advertising, to opt out of our collection and transfer of Web browsing information for interest-based advertising purposes, and to opt out of the collection and use of information for this purpose by other companies that participate in industry self-regulation. To opt out of our collection and transfer of application usage information for third parties to use for their own interest-based advertising purposes, you can use any controls that are provided for this purpose by the operating system on your mobile device. Please note that opting out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or in the applications you use. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. You may also continue to receive interest-based advertising from other companies.

#### What is market research? 

Market research is an organized effort to gather information about markets and customers. With the use of ScorecardResearch tags and surveys, Comscore’s market research group collects and analyzes information to provide products and services to companies around the world.  This information helps companies better understand and meet the needs of consumers. 

 **How do I manage my preferences for market research?**

To control your level of participation in our market research programs or opt out, click [here](http://www.scorecardresearch.com/preferences.aspx). By opting out of our market research program, ScorecardResearch tags will only be able to count your visit to a particular site but not identify your device beyond that count. Additionally, if your mobile device platform offers settings to limit data collection for interest-based advertising, you can use these settings to opt out of participating in our market research programs. For example, your device may “Limit Ad Tracking.”

 **What does opting out of market research on your browser do?**

The browser opt-out mechanisms linked above are cookie based (i.e., a cookie must be on your computer to tell our systems that you have opted out). The cookie-based method does not prevent us from identifying certain events (e.g., when a user visits a website).  The method, however, prevents us from associating that event with your browser or otherwise identifying you beyond us merely counting your visit. If you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, this opt-out may not be effective. Additionally, because different computers and different Internet browsers require their own version of the opt-out cookie, you may need to perform this opt-out process on any computers and browsers that you want to be opted-out.

#### Other important information about your personal information

 **Security**. We use organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect your personal information. For an overview of our security measures, click [here](http://www.comscore.com/about/privacy/security).

 **Third-party links and services**. Our Website may contain links to third-party websites. We do not control these linked websites and this Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of any third-party website that you visit before you provide any information to that website’s owner

#### International Visitors and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks

If you visit our Website or participate in our program from locations outside of the United States, please note that any information you provide to us through your use of our Website or your participation in the program may be transferred to and processed in countries other than the country from which you accessed our Website or participated in our program, including the United States where our central database is operated. Subject to the next paragraph below, please be aware that the United States, and other countries in which your data may be maintained, may not offer an equivalent level of protection as provided for in your country.

We take measures to help protect your personal information when it is transferred from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to third countries.  We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable (see [**here**](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en)). Comscore and its services comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States.

If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. Other measures we may rely on from time to time include having standard clauses approved by the European Commission (see [**here**](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en)) in our contracts with third parties that receive information outside the EEA or, in exceptional circumstances, transfer on the basis of permissible statutory derogations
