            <p class="bdytxt"> Thank you for taking the time to learn more about how CRE Internet 
                Services (“CRE”) manages your personal information. </p>
              <p class="bdytxt">This Privacy Policy explains CRE’s privacy practices in relation 
                to its Internet web site www.commercialrealestate.com.au (“Site”). 
                In some cases this Site may link or refer you to other web sites 
                or organisations, which have their own privacy policy and practices. </p>
              <p class="bdytxt">In this Privacy Policy, when we refer to ‘personal information’, 
                we mean information that can identify you or from which your identity 
                can be reasonably ascertained - for example, your name and contact 
                details. By using this Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy 
                Policy. </p>
              <p class="bdytxt">We reserve the right, to modify or remove portions of this Privacy 
                Policy at any time and this Privacy Policy should be read with the 
                other terms and conditions applicable to the use of this Site (See 
                the Site’s Terms of Use). </p>
              <p class="memhead">Personal Information </p>
              <p class="bdytxt">You can use this Site without telling us who you are. The only 
                personal information we collect about you is that which you choose 
                to tell us. For example, we may need to collect your personal information 
                so that we can provide you with services or to answer or forward 
                your requests or inquiries. It is our intention that this Privacy 
                Policy will protect your personal information from being dealt with 
                in any way that is inconsistent with applicable privacy laws in 
                Australia. </p>
              <p class="memhead">How Information is used</p>
                                <p class="bdytxt">Personal information 
                      that visitors submit to this Site is used only for the purpose 
                      for which it is submitted unless we tell you otherwise in 
                      this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection. Certain 
                      information you submit to this Site (for example, through 
                      the “List Your Requirement” and/or “List 
                      Your Real Estate” features), will be forwarded to the 
                      real estate agents in the State/s you nominate and may be 
                      stored in archives for approximately 4 months from the date 
                      of receipt. You should be aware that providing information 
                      to a real estate agent through our site including through 
                      the “List Your Requirement” and “List Your 
                      Real Estate” features will result in the information 
                      being passed to the real estate agent/s and your information 
                      may then be held in any way that does not conform with this 
                      Privacy Policy.</p>
					<p class="bdytxt">If CRE receives a request not to send commercial electronic messages to certain email addresses, CRE may indefinitely retain details of those addresses and the request so that it can comply with the request.</p>
					<p class="memhead">Other 
                      organisations that you come into contact with through this 
                      service </p>
              <p class="bdytxt">Whilst we may through this Site direct you or your queries to other 
                organisations (for example to real estate agents), we do this for 
                your convenience only. CRE is not responsible for the privacy practices 
                of those other organisations unless we tell you otherwise. Before 
                disclosing your personal information to those sites or organisations, 
                you should examine their privacy policies. </p>
              <p class="memhead">Disclosure </p>
              <p class="bdytxt">Apart from where you have consented or disclosure is necessary 
                to achieve the purpose for which it was submitted, personal information 
                may be disclosed in special situations where we have reason to believe 
                that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action 
                against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering (intentionally 
                or unintentionally) with CRE’s rights or property, users of 
                this Site, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. 
                Also, we may disclose personal information when we believe in good 
                faith that the law requires disclosure.</p>
              <p class="memhead">Security</p>
              <p class="bdytxt">We strive to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personal 
                information submitted to our Site, and we review and update our 
                security measures in light of current technologies. Unfortunately, 
                no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally 
                secure. We will nonetheless endeavour to take all reasonable steps 
                to protect the personal information you may transmit to us. </p>
              <p class="bdytxt">In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services 
                related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality 
                of any personal information held by us. However, we will not be 
                held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to 
                your personal information.</p>
              <p class="memhead">Use of Cookies</p>
              <p>“Cookies” are data that a Web site transfers to an 
                individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies, which 
                are industry standard and are used by many web sites, including 
                ours, can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site. 
                They may allow us to customise the Site to your needs. If you do 
                not want information collected through the use of cookies, there 
                is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or 
                accept the cookie feature. But you should note that cookies may 
                be necessary to provide you with some features of our on-line services.</p>
              <p>Like many web site operators, we also use software to analyse and 
                record visitor numbers and other details such as: </p>
              <ul>

                  Site; </li>

                <li class="bdytxt">how long those visitors (on average) spend on our Site when 
                  they do visit; and</li>
                <li class="bdytxt">common entry and exit points into our Site. </li>
              </ul>
                <p>This aggregate, non-personal information is used by us to assist 
                  in analysing the usage of our web site. </p>
              <p class="memhead">Access to your personal information</p>
              <p>We will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep any information 
                that we hold about you accurate and up to date. If, at any time, 
                you discover that information held about you is incorrect or if 
                you otherwise wish to review or correct that information, please 
                contact us.</p>
              <p class="memhead">Links To other Web Sites</p>
              <p>We may provide links from this Site to other web sites (“linked 
                sites”). Unless we tell you otherwise, these linked sites 
                are not under our control, and we do not accept responsibility for 
                the privacy practices of those sites or their operators. Before 
                disclosing your personal information to any other web site, you 
                should examine the terms and conditions of those sites and their 
                privacy practices.</p>
              <p class="memhead">Changes to this Privacy Statement</p>
              <p>CRE’s services are constantly evolving. This may affect the 
                types of information we collect and how we use it. If this occurs, 
                we will update our Privacy Policy. We therefore encourage you to 
                periodically review this Privacy Policy so that you remain informed
