### Disclaimer

Clients should read the account opening documentation, disclosure documents and trading regulations carefully so that they fully understand limitations to the policies regarding executions of stops and no deficit accounts.

#### Risk Warning

Trading foreign currencies in the spot Forex market is a highly risky form of investing. It is a demanding yet potentially profitable opportunity for experienced traders. Before trading in the Forex market, you should carefully consider investment objectives, level of experience and risk tolerance. It is important to only invest money you can afford to lose.

There is a high degree of risk in trading foreign currencies. Any market transaction involving currencies contains risks including, but not limited to, the potential for random political events and economic conditions that may significantly affect the market price or liquidity of a currency.

Furthermore, the use of high leverage in trading margin accounts means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on deposited funds. This may work in your favor or not. There is the possibility that you could sustain a total loss of funds deposited when you trade spot currencies should the market move against your positions. Traders may lower their exposure to risk by employing risk-reducing strategies such as stop-loss or limit orders. 

There are also risks associated with utilizing an internet-based deal execution software application including, but not limited, to the failure of hardware and software.
