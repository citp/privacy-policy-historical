We store uploaded files to our server only temporarily for conversion purposes. When the conversion process ends, we delete those files from our servers automatically.

There is no back-up of stored files. Contents of the files are not being monitored in any way by Cometdocs.com or any other third party. The content of the file is accessible via download link users receive in their email or in their File Manager if they are registered users.

We will email you only for service related purposes: 1. to send you a converted/transferred/shared file, 2. inform you about the status of a conversion/transfer/sharing process and 3. to inform you about the status of your account and your files.
