<p>
   <span class="big"><b>Your Privacy is Our Priority</b></span><br>
   At CompUSA, your privacy is very important to us. We appreciate our customers and
   understand the value of protecting your rights. We hope to address all of your
   concerns through this list of privacy-related Frequently Asked Questions.
   For our  younger shoppers, our <a href="kid_privacy.asp">Kids' Privacy Policy</a>
   explains additional measures we have taken to ensure their privacy and safety online.
   Our site is also <a href="p3pcompliance.asp">P3P compliant</a>.
</p>

<p>
   <span class="small"><b>Does CompUSA collect my IP address?</b></span><br>
   Yes. We use this to identify your PC and your shopping cart, as well as to help us
   diagnose any problems you may encounter with our server. IP addresses are not linked
   to any personally identifiable information.
</p>

<p>
   <span class="small"><b>Why does CompUSA need my personal Information?</b></span><br>
   We use your name, e-mail address, phone number, mailing address and credit card
   information to process your orders and/or notify you if you enter and win a contest
   on our site. This information is stored in a secure database, and is only available
   to individuals with proper clearance. To offer our products and services in the most
   efficient manner, CompUSA contracts with third party service partners. These partners
   provide us with data collection, storage, e-mail/mail support, analysis and reporting
   services and are restricted from using your information in any way, other than to help
   us make our site and services more useful to our visitors. Service partners are required
   to sign confidentiality agreements and will abide by CompUSA's privacy policies.
   Additionally, we may share information with law enforcement agencies or other companies
   assisting us in fraud prevention or investigations. Please also note that manufacturers
   may collect your information from us for warranty or product registration purposes, if
   applicable. To opt-out of having your personal information available to our service partners,
   please <a href="cm_optout.asp">click here</a>.
</p>

<p>
   <span class="small"><b>What is your credit card fraud policy?</b></span><br>
   In the unlikely event that you experience unauthorized use of your credit card, promptly
   report the fraudulent activity to your credit card company. Under the Fair Credit Billing
   Act, you are only liable for the first $50 of the fraudulent charges. Please check with
   your credit card company to verify specific terms and conditions.
</p>

<p>
   <span class="small"><b>Will I receive mail from CompUSA?</b></span><br>
   We only send information about our hot deals and specials to our customers who find it
   useful. You can opt-out of receiving future communications from us when you set up your
   account or by updating your account information. When you participate in a contest or
   survey, you also have the choice of opting-out at that time.
</p>

<p>
   <span class="small"><b>How safe is it to shop online?</b></span><br>
   Today, the Internet is actually the safest way of doing business with your credit card.
   We have made it safer to use your credit card on our site than it is to use it in more
   traditional ways, such as in retail stores or restaurants.
</p>

<p>
   <span class="small"><b>What is SSL and how does it help protect my privacy?</b></span><br>
   We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for mutual authentication, data encryption
   and data integrity- all to help ensure secure transactions for our customers. SSL is
   the industry standard security protocol to encode sensitive information, such as your
   credit card number. SSL creates a shared digital key, which only lets the sender and
   the receiver of the transmission scramble or unscramble information. To everyone else,
   even the servers relaying the message, the SSL transmission is indecipherable. SSL
   encryption can only be broken by intercepting the encrypted message, recording it, and
   using a computer to try every possible combination until the key is cracked. Most keys
   range from 40 to 1,024 digits long...as you can imagine, the number of possible
   combinations can be into the billions and beyond! SSL deals with data encryption during
   transmission, not storage.
</p>

<p>
   <span class="small"><b>Ok, so how about encryption?</b></span><br>
   Encryption is based on the mathematical scrambling and unscrambling of messages. The type
   of encryption we use assigns two keys - one is a public key and one is a private key. When
   you send us a message, you use our public key to encrypt your message. Once we receive your
   encrypted message, we use the private key to decode it. The same key cannot both encrypt and
   decrypt information. So, information encrypted using the private key can only be decrypted
   using the public key, and vice versa- ensuring the security of your information.
</p>

<p>
   <span class="small"><b>I've heard a lot about Secure Sites. What does that mean?</b></span><br>
   Before completing any transaction on a website, you should make sure it is a Secure Site.
   Being on a Secure Site means you are connected under the cloak of SSL security. You can tell
   if you are on a Secure Site if you see a padlock or key somewhere along the bottom of your
   browser's window. If the lock is closed or if the key is unbroken, you are dealing with a Secure Site.

   Simply put, a "cookie" is a small file that serves as an identifier stored on your
   machine. Although they are not required to browse our site, we use cookies to make web shopping
   possible. For instance, when you are ready to purchase an item, a cookie allows our site to
   "remember" you have added the item to your shopping cart.

<p>
   <span class="small"><b>Other things you might consider in protecting your privacy:</b></span><br>

   personal data first.  We suggest using an application that specializes in removal of this data.
