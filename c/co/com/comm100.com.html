                invite them to become members of our website. We collect the username and password

        <span class="borderSpan">11. User Data</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Comm100 Users use the Service to host data and information ("User Data"). Comm100
                will NOT review, share, distribute, or reference any such User Data except required
                by law. </li>
            <li>User Data is collected and owned by Comm100 Users, thus the use of User Data is
                governed by the privacy practice of Comm100 Users instead of Comm100. This privacy
                policy does not cover Comm100 Users' policy on information of their website visitors
                and clients collected through Comm100 web sites and services. Comm100 takes no responsibility
                for the privacy issues of Comm100 Users. </li>
            <li>Individual records of User Data may be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of
                investigating an abuse complaint in Comm100 Email Marketing, resolving a problem,
                support issues, or suspected violation of the Comm100 Hosted Service Agreement,
                or as may be required by law. To prevent spamming in Comm100 Email Marketing, the
                Company's customer service representatives may look into the content of your emails
                to decide if Comm100 Email Marketing system will send out your emails.</li>
            <li>To maintain our email sending reputation, we examine the delivery data on each individual
                email basis for Comm100 users. The email delivery data includes, but is not limited
                to, if an email is delivered, reported as spam or rejected by receiving server.
                These delivery data may be collected from our email sending program or provided
                by the email receiving entity. </li>
            <li>Users are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of their
                Comm100 usernames and passwords. </li>
        </ul>
        <span class="borderSpan">12. Security</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Comm100 uses robust security measures to protect data from unauthorized access,
                maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of User Data. When the
                Service is accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, Firefox version
                2.0 or later, or Safari version 3.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology
                protects User Data using both server authentication and data encryption. The chat
                content in Comm100 Live Chat is encrypted with SSL by default. These technologies
                help ensure that User Data is safe, secure, and only available to the User to whom
                the information belongs and those to whom the User has granted access. Comm100 also
                implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session
                identifications, and the Company hosts its Web sites in a secure server environment
                that uses firewalls and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access
                from outside intruders. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or
                method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its
                absolute security. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personally
                identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is
                received. If you have any questions about the security of your personally identifiable
                information, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@comm100.com">privacy@comm100.com</a>.

            <li>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy
                policy on the home page, and in other places we deem appropriate so that you are
