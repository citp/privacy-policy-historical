Here is extended Information about Our privacy Policy
<br><br>
<h1>I. Information We Collect</h1>
<h2>A. Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</h2>
<br>
CompareStorePrices.co.uk does not automatically collect any personal information about you. We do collect PII, including but not limited to your name, e-mail address, geographical location, age and gender, through membership registration, newsletter sign-up requests or promotional contests. Please note that it is not necessary for you to become a member in order to use many of the features on CompareStorePrices.co.uk.com, a non-member can easily see products and prices, perform searches, read reviews and take advantage of many other useful features on the site.
<br><br>
CompareStorePrices.co.uk also operates a free e-newsletter service - the CompareStorePrices.co.uk Update - to help you keep up-to-date with the best deals, contests and CompareStorePrices.co.uk news. This is an opt-in service so, as a member, you will receive the newsletter. To unsubscribe simply send an e-mail to

<noscript>You need JavaScript to see my email address</noscript>
 and include your e-mail address.
<br><br>
The reason that we ask for this PII is to provide you with information that you may request, to customize your experience on the Site, and to contact you when necessary in connection with any promotions you participate in.
<br><br>
We also use this information for internal business purposes, such as aggregating the data to help us to create a profile of CompareStorePrices.co.uk visitors, as a whole, so that we can; a) build a better understanding of our users and enhance the services we offer, and b) attract advertisers to spend money on CompareStorePrices.co.uk, thus enabling our free price comparison service to operate.
<br><br>
Unless you direct us not to, we may use your personal information to contact you about offers or promotions from CompareStorePrices.co.uk and selected third parties we think you would be interested in.
<br><br>
<h2>B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h2>
<br><br>
CompareStorePrices.co.uk uses cookies (a small text file containing a unique string of numbers or letters that is placed on a computer) to ‘remember’ your computer when you visit the site. Using cookies helps us serve ads, take polls and better manage the services we offer. This will not collect any personally identifiable information about you. Cookies do not recognize you as a person, just your computer. They cannot be used to obtain other information from your hard drive.
<br><br>
For each visitor to our website, our Web server automatically recognizes only the visitor's IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Upon visiting our website, we assign each visitor a unique ID that is used to track visitor traffic patterns within our website. We also collect aggregate and user-specific information on the pages that visitors access or visit. We reserve the right to retain all website traffic reporting data as long as may be reasonably necessary for accounting and auditing purposes.
<br><br>
<h1>II. Information Sharing</h1>
<br><br>
CompareStorePrices.co.uk may use third party vendors to help us operate our business and this Site or administer activities on our behalf. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes. Any third-party vendor so used has agreed to protect the confidentiality of information provided by CompareStorePrices.co.uk.
<br><br>
CompareStorePrices.co.uk and/or our marketing partners may enhance and/or merge PII with commercially-available third party data collected from other sources in an effort to ensure that the messages being sent to the consumer in online and/or offline marketing programs are relevant to their interests. In the event we enhance and/or merge such personally identifiable information with data collected from other sources, we will take reasonable steps to maintain the integrity and quality of that information.
<br><br>
CompareStorePrices.co.uk may share PII (including information that has been enhanced with information from other sources) with co-branded partners, advertisers, third party marketers, our affiliated entities for their online and/or offline marketing programs or in connection with the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial asset, reorganization or liquidation of any CompareStorePrices.co.uk division.
<br><br>
Please note that while CompareStorePrices.co.uk encourages merchants and marketing partners to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, we are not responsible for the information practices of our merchants or marketing partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by such third parties is subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from this policy. Please be sure to review their policy prior to providing any information.
<br><br>
CompareStorePrices.co.uk may release account and any other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of CompareStorePrices.co.uk or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.
