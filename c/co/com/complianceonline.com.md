If you elect to engage in these activities, however, ComplianceOnline may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), e-mail address, employer, job title and department, telephone and fax numbers, and other personal information.

When ordering products or services, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to proceed with that activity.

When you buy and install the new products, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we keep this registration information on file with any information you've already given us on previous visits to our Web site. This is considered your personal profile.

However, if you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, you may set your Web browser to do so, if your browser so permits.

ComplianceOnline may monitor how a visitor arrives at the Web site, but cannot and will not gather information about other sites you have been on. ComplianceOnline does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.

**Analytics partners**

ComplianceOnline works with companies that provide services to us to determine whether users who saw or clicked on an ad or content later bought the item displayed in the ad (or took some other action ComplianceOnline wanted them to take). To do this, these companies may collect information about the content or ads users view, how long they spend on different pages, how they arrived on a particular page (e.g., through a search query, link from another page, or a bookmark), and how they respond to the ads we show them. ComplianceOnline also may share portions of our log file data, including IP address, with these partners for analytics purposes. In the event your IP address is shared, this information may be used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection speed, whether you have visited ComplianceOnline website in a shared location, and type of the device used to visit ComplianceOnline website.

**EU-US Privacy Shield**

For the personal data that we receive from EEA, we remain compliant with EU-US Privacy Shield as specified by the United States Department of Commerce pertaining to personal data collection, retention and use from EU countries. We adhere to the Privacy Shield principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfers, security, data integrity & purpose limitation, access and recourse, enforcement and liability when processing personal data from the EEA in the US.

Visitors to our website from outside the US must be aware that they are sending information to the US where our servers are located. Further, this information may be transferred to other countries depending on the type of information and the way it is stored by us. US or the countries that the data is being sent to may or may not have data protection acts that are as protective or comprehensive as your country, but our privacy policy will continue to govern the usage, storage and collection of personal data.

**Accountability and Liability for Onward Transfer**

ComplianceOnline is required to take certain steps when transferring personal data received from the European Union to third parties (such as including contractual provisions in our third party contracts which require them to provide the same level of protection the Privacy Shield requires and limiting their use of the data to the specified services provided on our behalf).

We take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that third parties process personal data in accordance with our Privacy Shield obligations and to stop and remediate any unauthorized processing.

Under certain circumstances, we may remain liable for the acts of third parties who perform services on our behalf in connection with their handling of personal data that we transfer to them(including where we transfer personal data to them pursuant to the Privacy Shield).

We will respond to any complaints as soon as possible and within 45 days.

You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection authority and we will work with them to resolve your concerns.

Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, in certain limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available provided that you have taken the following steps: (1) raised your compliant directly to us using the contact details above and provided us the opportunity to resolve the issue; and (2) raised the issue through the relevant data protection authority and allowed the U.S Department of Commerce an opportunity to resolve the complaint at no cost to you.

**Access to information**

You have the right to access the personal data we collect about you in the EEA and to request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the Privacy Shield. These access rights may not apply in some cases, including where we must comply with legal requirements or if providing access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances or where it would violate the rights of someone other than the individual requesting access.

If you would like to request access to, correction, or deletion of your personal data collected in the EEA, you can submit a written request using the contact information provided below. We may request specific information from you in order to confirm your identity. In some circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee for access to your information.
