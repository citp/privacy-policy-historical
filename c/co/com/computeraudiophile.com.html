<p>Audiophile Style, LLC is strongly committed to protecting your privacy and providing a safe online experience for all of our users and subscribers while offering the highest quality publications and services to them. This Privacy Policy discloses what information we gather, how we use it, to whom we disclose personal information and other information you have provided, and how to correct or change personal information that you have provided to us. This Privacy Policy applies to Audiophile Style, LLC, subsidiaries, and affiliates. We urge you to read the complete Privacy Policy set forth below, as well as our Terms and Conditions of Use, and contact us if you have any questions. </p>
<p>I.<br>
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?<br>
Personal Information. We collect personally identifiable information, such as names, mailing addresses, e-mail addresses, demographic information, and similar information in a variety of situations when you register at our web site, when you enter personal information on our web site as a condition of participating in contests, promotions, or sweepstakes offered or when you wish to have a product or service fulfilled by a fulfillment partner who can meet the continuing needs of our customers.<br>
Our site may collect credit card and related financial information if you wish to purchase a product or subscribe to any publication or service offered. If you wish to subscribe to one of our publications or place an order for products or services online, you must generally establish a credit card account with us or our vendors.<br>
Information Collected Automatically. Our web sites automatically collect certain information, such as your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times and referring website address. This helps facilitate your online experience at our web sites. See Sections IV and V of this Privacy Policy for more detail on cookies, web beacons, and other information collected automatically for research and marketing purposes by our Audiophile Style, LLC.  <br>
II.<br>
WHAT DO WE DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION?<br>
We use the personal information you provide to operate our business. A user may, at any time, opt out of receiving e-mail. We also use collected information to evaluate and administer our products and services, respond to any problems that may arise, such as web site failures, difficulties in navigating our site or accessing certain features, as well as to gauge user trends to determine what products and services are most popular with users. We allow users of our website to send articles or links by e-mail to other parties who may be interested in them. We do not retain any e-mail addresses of either the sender or recipient of such articles or links after they are sent, and do not share "send a friend" e-mail addresses with third parties.  <br>
III.<br>
HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?<br>
We share your personal information only as described below.<br>
Public Postings. You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information, personal or otherwise, online in any community area (whether through Audiophile Style, LLC.s web site or any other service available online), that information can be collected and used by others. Accordingly, you should use caution when sharing any personal information with others in any community area (whether through Audiophile Style's web site or any other service available online).<br>
Required Disclosures of Information. We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request; to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect the integrity of our site and our property and assure adherence to our terms of use; to protect the safety of our visitors or others; to fulfill your requests; or to cooperate in any legal investigation or process.<br>
Changes in Corporate Structure. In developing our business, we might sell certain assets, or the company, or parts of it, may be sold, merged or otherwise transferred. In such transactions, user information, whether personally identifiable or otherwise, may be one of the transferred assets.  <br>
IV.<br>
HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?<br>
Your Web browser offers "cookies" which, if you allow their use, store small amounts of data on your computer when you visit a web site. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information about you and therefore cannot be used to identify you personally. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best, and also enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your browser and our websites are viewable even if you disable the cookie function on your browser. However, if you disable cookies, some advanced and customized features or offerings will not be available to you.  <br>
V.<br>
HOW DO WE USE WEB BEACONS, WEB ANALYTICS, AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MARKETING TECHNOLOGIES?<br>
A number of technologies exist to assess consumer behavior both on-line and off-line. Audiophile Style, LLC employs a variety of these technologies, including web analytics techniques, to assess consumer behavior and to understand how we can better serve our customers. In the course of using these technologies, we automatically collect non-personal information from you, including but not limited to the following types of information: Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login, e-mail address; computer and connection information such as browser type which may be aggregated with other information for analytic purposes.<br>
Some of our web pages, promotional e-mail messages, and/or newsletters may contain electronic images known as web beacons, which are also called single-pixel gifs. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information, but they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about the usage of our web sites and to track the number of users who have opened and acted up our promotional e-mail messages. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.  <br>
VI.<br>
WHAT ABOUT THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS?<br>
Some of the banner ads displayed in our web sites are provided by third parties. These ads contain cookies and may also contain web beacons. Cookies or web beacons received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this information. We use third parties to serve some of the advertisements that are placed within our sites and they may use information (not including personally identifiable information) about your visits to our sites and other sites to assist in serving advertisements to you. These companies may employ cookies, web beacons, and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. They may share anonymous information with their clients such as date/time of the banner ad shown, the specific ad shown, the IP address, etc. Google is our primary third party ad server. If you would like to know more about their information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures, please see <a href="http://www.google.com" title="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>.  <br>
VII.<br>
HOW CAN YOU CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?<br>
