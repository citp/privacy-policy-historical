  <p><strong>THE TYPE  OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</strong></p>
  <p>Like
most places on the Internet, simply by visiting our website you
automatically tell us certain information. This includes basic
information such as your IP address, when you visited, the website from
where you came prior to visiting us, the website where you go when you
leave our website, your computer's operating system, and the type of
web browser that you are using. Our website automatically records this
basic information about you.</p>
  <p>And like many other websites, we
may use cookies. In plain English, this means information that our
website's server transfers to your computer. This information can be
used to track your session on our website. Cookies may also be used to
customize our website content for you as an individual. If you are
using one of the common Internet web browsers, you can set up your
browser to either let you know when you receive a cookie or to deny
cookie access to your computer.</p>
  <p>We may also collect any data

always choose not to provide us with information. However, if you do
withhold information, we may deny you access to some or all of our
website's services and features.</p>
  <p>Some transactions between
you and our website may involve payment by credit card, debit card,
checks, money orders, and/or third party online payment services. In
