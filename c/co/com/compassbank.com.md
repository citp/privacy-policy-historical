Privacy Guidelines

**Consumer Privacy  
&   
How It Affects You**

**_What You Should Know_**  
Since 1855, CompassBank has been guided by the belief that protecting each person’s right to privacy is fundamental to the quality of customer relationships. Although current technology and new marketing practices have increased the amount of customer information that can be collected and shared in today’s marketplace, at CompassBank, we want you to know that any personal information about you will not be sold, nor rented to marketers or any other third-party. You do not need to take any action to prevent sharing of such information. Any personal information gathered will be treated with the utmost confidence. While some information sharing is critical to providing quality service, we recognize that one of our most important assets is our customers’ trust. Rest assured that safekeeping of customer information has always been, and will always remain, a priority for CompassBank.

 ** _Information About You_**  
We may obtain personal information about you, our customer, from a variety of sources. You may provide some information such as name, home address, telephone number, e-mail address, tax ID number, assets, and income directly to CompassBank when opening a deposit account or applying for a loan. We obtain other data from your transactions with us, and from outside sources, such as credit bureaus. We limit the use and collection of information about you to that which we reasonably believe necessary for administering our business and providing superior service, while offering products and services that we think will be of interest to you.

Be assured that we do not use “cookies” on our Web site to monitor or collect your preference of information, products, or services. Additionally, COPPA (the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) was enacted in April, 2000 to protect children under the age of 13 from online collection of personal information. We do not monitor children’s access to our Web site, nor do we intentionally market our products to children. 

 ** _Maintaining Accurate Information_**  
The continuing accuracy of your information is also important, and we strive to maintain current, complete and accurate information. Should you ever believe that our records contain inaccurate or incomplete information about you, please notify us. We will investigate your concerns and make every effort to promptly correct any inaccuracies.

Should any of your information change prior to receiving any statements or mailings from us, please let us know so that we can update our records accordingly.

 ** _Information Sharing_**  
We may engage certain selected third-party providers with whom we have contracted under strict confidentiality agreements to assist us in our day-to-day operations - such as data processors and check printers - or to assist us in providing a broader array of financial services - such as debit/credit card issuers - which we might not otherwise be in a position to offer you. For example, these companies might assist us in fulfilling your service request, processing your transaction, or mailing account statements.

We may share information we obtain, such as: your name, address, and e-mail address, with carefully selected trusted business partners (such as direct mailing companies working on our behalf) for promotional or marketing purposes under strict confidentiality agreements. We may do so in order to offer you special financial incentives or features on existing products, or announce new products that might be of interest to you. By law, we are permitted to share information about our experiences or transactions with you or your account (such as your payment history with us) with companies related to us by common control or ownership (“affiliates”). We may also share information with reputable consumer reporting agencies to determine your creditworthiness, or to protect against fraud.

In addition, we may disclose information about you to other third parties such as regulatory authorities, and law enforcement officials as permitted and/or required by law. For example, we may be required to share information about you and the products and services you use with parties named in a lawsuit or administrative action when we are served with a subpoena.

When CompassBank conducts business with third parties, we require them to maintain similar standards of conduct regarding the privacy of personally identifiable customer information that we provide to them.

 ** _Fiduciary/Private Banking Information_**  
Fiduciary information is closely guarded when we act as trustee or fiduciary. Such information is subject to more restrictive information sharing limitations than other types of information, both internally and externally. Should you have questions regarding fiduciary information, you may contact your Private Bank Relationship Manager. 

 ** _Safeguarding Your Information_**  
At CompassBank, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards according to established security standards and procedures, and we continually assess, upgrade and install new technology to protect this information. Access to nonpublic customer information is limited to those employees with a business reason to know such information in order to provide products or services to you. CompassBank employees are bound by a Code of Conduct requiring confidential treatment of customer information, and are trained to understand and comply with this privacy policy. Employees who violate the bank’s Code of Conduct and privacy standards will be subject to our normal disciplinary measures.
