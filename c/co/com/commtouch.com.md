# Privacy Policy | Commtouch - Internet Security Solutions

## Commtouch’s Commitment to Privacy

At Commtouch, we respect your privacy. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available through a link at the bottom of every page of our Web site.

While we welcome individuals browsing our Web site, our Web site is not directed at individual consumers, and we are not marketing consumer oriented services or products.

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Commtouch corporate Web site ([http://www.commtouch.com](http://www.commtouch.com/)) and the Commtouch Café blog ([http://blog.commtouch.com](http://blog.commtouch.com/)).

## Cookies

"Cookies" are small data files that are written to and stored on your hard drive when you visit a Web site; they do not read files on your hard drive. Like most Web sites, we use cookies to personalize a user's experience of our Web site and to make it easier for users to complete forms. Our cookies do not track user movement once you leave our Web site.

Most Web browsers allow the user to be notified upon the proposed installation of a cookie and the user can then decline the cookie. Even if you decline the cookie, you may continue to use our entire Web site.

We use data and information received from our cookies for marketing research purposes, to improve the site’s content and structure, for example, to potentially revise or restructure our Web site for easier and more intuitive movement throughout.. We may also use the information to evaluate our site's technical capacity in order to improve it. 

Currently, the data and information we collect with cookies is only reviewed in an aggregated form, which is not personally identifiable. In the future, however, we may correlate the data and information received from cookies with personally identifiable information, to identify specific users and track their Web site usage.  Whether or not the data and information received from cookies is correlated to any specific user, we do not and will not disclose, sell, rent or share any data or information derived from cookies with any third parties.

## Registration to the Site

Although you may generally use our site without providing us with any personally identifiable information, for some applications or services – such as access to white papers, newsletters, online events or evaluation software – you may be asked to voluntarily provide certain types of personally identifiable information. The types of personal information collected on these pages include:

  * Name
  * Company name
  * Email address
  * Phone number



The information you submit to Commtouch’s Web site is stored in a database to enable you to return without re-registering. Your “logged-in” status may be saved in your browser via a cookie or you may choose to re-authenticate to the Commtouch site using a username (your email address) and password that is provided to you when you first register. Either way, the personal information that you submit will be saved by Commtouch; we do not share this information with any outside parties for any reason, unless agreed by you explicitly on the registration form you completed. 

The only users that will receive ongoing correspondence from Commtouch are those that specifically request to receive a newsletter or other correspondence by marking the related field on a registration form. We do, however, reserve the right to contact registered users from time to time, and within reason, for example, to offer our services to relevant potential customers or partners.

## Aggregate Information

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site and analyze user trends. This includes reviewing data and information contained in log files located on our Web server, which record the date and time of each visit to the site, the user's IP (internet protocol) address, the referring URL (the prior Web site visited) and the files viewed on our Web site (including HTML pages, documents downloaded etc.). 

We do not disclose, sell, rent or share any information derived from log files with any third parties.

## Links to Third-Party Web Sites

Through our Web pages, you may connect to third party Web sites via hyperlinks, and the connections may or may not be obvious. We are not responsible for the collection, use, maintenance, sharing or disclosure of data and information by such third parties. We encourage our users to be aware of the varied privacy policies of Web sites that they visit.

## Your Right to Review & Modify Data & Information

You have the right, at any time, to review and/or modify any of your personally identifiable information that you provide during registration, or any other voluntarily provided information. To do this, edit your profile on the site. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

## Our Commitment To Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have applied reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. However, due to technological limitations and the risk of unlawful interceptions and accessing of transmissions and/or data, we cannot completely assure you, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable data and information, and any other electronically communicated information, will be absolutely confidential.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

Due to changing technological and marketing demands, we reserve the right to change our policies regarding the privacy of your personally identifiable information in the future. If that happens, we will make every effort to promptly update this Privacy Policy, and will post notice of that change on this Privacy Policy page. Your continued use of the Commtouch Web site following changes to this policy will indicate that you accept the changes.
