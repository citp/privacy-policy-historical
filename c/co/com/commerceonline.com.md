# Commerce Bank - Privacy Policy

  
**Privacy & Security**  
Commerce Bancorp, Inc., consists of a number of related companies called affiliates. These affiliated companies consist of the Commerce Banks, Commerce Capital Markets, Inc., Commerce Insurance Services, Inc., In the state of New York, insurance services are offered through Commerce Insurance Brokerage Services, and Commerce Insurance Brokerage Services/New York, Inc. In order to bring you the financial products and services you want and expect, information about current and former customers is shared among the Commerce-affiliated companies. 

This notice provides detail about the information we collect and disclose, and explains how we handle privacy as it relates to you and your accounts. 

**Our Commitment To You**  
We want you to know that your relationship with us is treated with the confidentiality that you expect and deserve. Trust, privacy and confidentiality are the guiding principles upon which Commerce's relationship with you is built. Because we are committed to servicing the needs of our customers, we will take all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of your relationship with us. 

**Protecting Customer Information**  
Access to your personal information is limited to those Commerce team members who need to know the information to provide products and services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect your non-public information. 

**What You Can Do To Protect Your Financial Information**  


Remember that cellular, mobile and cordless phones are not secure. Neither is electronic mail (e-mail); regard it as you would a postcard. 

**Crime Prevention**  
Commerce Bank takes crime prevention very seriously. For your convenience, the links below go to practical, expert advice. 

**Important Information About Procedures for Opening a New Account**  
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask you to send a copy of your driver's license or other identifying documents. 

**Information We Collect**  
We collect **non-public, personal** information about you to help serve your financial needs, provide customer service, offer new products or services, and fulfill legal and regulatory requirements. These types of **non-public, personal** information may include: 

We collect only the information necessary to deliver quality products and services to our customers. 

**Information We Share**  
We are permitted by law to share information we have about our experiences or transactions with you or your account with **our affiliates**. This includes account balances and your payment history with us, as well as information we may collect, like credit report, asset and income data. We are also permitted by law to share **non-public information** about you with outside companies or **non-affiliated, third parties** , like check printers, who participate with us in supplying products and services to customers. 

We may also share information about you with a medical care institution or medical professional in order to verify coverage of benefits, inform you of a medical problem of which you may not be aware, or conduct an audit that would enable us to verify treatment. 

These **non-affiliated, third-party** companies are not permitted to use our customer information for any purposes other than the services intended. We will share your information with these companies only if they agree to treat it confidentially. 

We are permitted or required by law to share your information with credit bureaus and government entities in responding to subpoenas and other legal processes. We also share your information with whomever you request. 

We may share information we have about you within the Commerce-affiliated companies in order to provide you with complete financial solutions. Under the law, Commerce is permitted to share identification information within the Commerce family of companies, as well as information related to the transactions and experiences we have with our customers. Commerce and its affiliates engage in many businesses, for example, banking, mortgage lending, brokerage and investment services, trust administration, asset management and insurance. Sharing information among these businesses increases your access to our products and services, allows us to match our products and services to your specific needs and simplifies transaction flows. 

We may also disclose information we have about you to companies with whom we have joint marketing agreements or who provide marketing services on our behalf. For example, we share information about you with an insurance underwriting firm in order that you may receive information concerning various insurance products. We may share information about you with another financial institution, such as a mortgage lending company, in order to jointly offer financial services to you. 

The types of information we may share are:

**We do not sell, rent or otherwise provide customer information to non-affiliated companies so they can market non-financial services to you.**

Commerce may make a decision to sell a particular line of business (for example, mortgage servicing rights). Usually, an integral part of that business is its customer database. Commerce reserves the right, in circumstances such as these, to transfer ownership of such customer databases to the purchaser. 

We do not share any **non-public, personal** information about our customers or former customers with anyone, except as permitted by law. 

If you terminate your relationship with us, we will adhere to the information policies and practices described in this policy, as well as your opt-out election, with regard to information we have collected on you. 

**If you do not wish us to share your information among Commerce-affiliated companies, non-affiliated third parties or joint marketers, other than those permitted by law, please call us at 1-888-937-1050, or[click here](https://secure.commerceonline.com/forms/www/special_offers_status.cfm) to complete our online form. If you have previously informed us of your preference, you do not need to do so again.** If there are multiple owners on an account, product or service, any one of them may request on behalf of any or all of the fellow owners that their information is not to be shared or their names removed from our mailing lists. 

**Online Protection**  
All of our Internet forms and pages with customer or other sensitive information are protected by data-encryption technology. Encryption is a procedure for turning plain text or other information into an unrecognizable pattern of data requiring a unique key to open or "decode" the formula. The unbroken key or closed lock on your screen indicates that the connection is secure. 

Although we provide data encryption and other types of protection to maintain the security of our customers' information, there are certain security, corruption, transmission error and access-availability risks associated with using open networks such as the Internet. Should you decide at any time that you prefer not to use our online services, please [visit any store](http://bank.commerceonline.com/information/branch_locations/index.cfm) or call us at 1-888-751-9000. 

**How We Handle E-Mail**  
Our website does not require you to disclose any personal identifying information. If, however, you choose to contact us via e-mail, please keep in mind that your e-mail address, and any other information your e-mail header shows about you, such as your name or organization, will be revealed to us in the e-mail. We pledge, however, that when you communicate with us via e-mail, we will use that information only to respond to the inquiry, provide accurate information to any questions, and in certain instances, assist in the resetting of passwords. Your e-mail address will not be sold, nor will it be shared with others outside of Commerce unless we are compelled to do so by law. 

We want to be very clear: we will not obtain personally identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us. 

E-mail shared via Synacor (formerly Chek.com), the free e-mail service provided through MyCommerceOnline, is not encrypted.

We periodically review information regarding our customers' accounts and transactions to select the names, addresses (including e-mail addresses) and telephone numbers of customers to receive special offers of products or services that we believe will be of interest to our customers. We recognize, however, that you might have preferences about how we contact you to let you know about them. Regarding your **non-public, personal** information, such as credit reports and application information, you may also prefer for us not to share it among our Commerce-affiliated companies. Additionally, you may prefer that we not share information with the **non-affiliated, third-party** companies we select to provide products and services that we do not. If you do not want us to share your information for any of these purposes or communicate offers to you, call us at 1-888-937-1050 or [click here](https://secure.commerceonline.com/forms/www/special_offers_status.cfm) to complete our online form.
