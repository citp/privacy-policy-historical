# Comenity - Privacy

## Privacy statement

Last revised August 17, 2011.

This Privacy Policy (also referred to herein as our "Policy") has been created by Comenity, LLC ("Comenity" sometimes also referred to herein as "we" or "us") to demonstrate our commitment to on-line data protection and privacy. Our web site includes areas in which you may provide personal information, therefore we have developed this Policy to inform you of Comenity’s practices concerning information we collect about you on this site. This Policy is available on our homepage and by clicking the privacy link at the bottom of every page throughout our website. If you have additional questions about this Policy, please contact us at _[webmaster@comenity.net](mailto:webmaster@comenity.com)_. This Policy governs the URL http://www.comenity.net, and describes what information our site collects about you, how it is collected and how it is used. This Policy does not apply to the treatment of personal information collected off-line, or to web sites found at other locations, including any web sites operated by entities affiliated with Comenity. For information concerning privacy practices of web sites operated by other entities, including entities affiliated with Comenity, please consult the privacy practices posted at those web sites. You should read this Policy before using our web site, as your use of the web site signifies that you agree with all terms of this Policy.  If  you disagree with any part of this Policy, please do not use the website.

**Information collected about you**

Comenity’s web site collects certain personal information about you whenever you send an email to Comenity or complete our on-line form, such as the ”Contact Us” form. The personal information you provide can identify you and your business, and may include such items as your name, email and US mail addresses, and telephone numbers. 

  
Comenity also collects or logs other information that cannot identify you personally when you visit our web site. This information includes your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address and your domain name. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by the Internet Service Provider ("ISP") computer through which you access the web, and a domain name is the name of the ISP computer itself through which you access the web. 

Comenity logs IP addresses and domain names and aggregates them for system administration purposes and to monitor the use of our site. We use the aggregated information to measure the number of visits to our site, the average time spent on our site, the number of pages viewed, to monitor various other site statistics and to diagnose problems with our server. This monitoring process helps us continuously improve the content we provide. Comenity does not share these statistics with outside parties and does not link IP addresses or domain names with any personally identifying information, which means that a visitor's session will be logged on our servers, but the visitor will remain anonymous. 

We also may retain information concerning the web sites that users access by means of links at our site, and the web sites from which users link to our site. This information does not include personally identifiable data concerning those users. 

**Information placed automatically on your computer - cookies**

When you view our website, we may store certain information on your computer. This information is stored in the form of a small text file called a "cookie," and is used by Comenity in certain cases to record the Flash plug-in version installed on your computer. This information helps us ensure that your browser can read graphics used at our web site. 

  
Cookies also can be used for other purposes, such as to store user IDs and passwords so that visitors do not have to reenter that information each time they visit a site. These and other cookie functions may be enabled by our web site as appropriate. 

Cookies are read only by the server that placed them and cannot execute any code or virus. With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. Please be aware, however, that some features of our web site may be unavailable to you if cookies are erased or blocked. 

#### How your information is used

We use the information you have provided to us in an on-line form to respond to your request for information about Comenity or comments you may have about our web site or other services provided by Comenity. We will disclose personal information as required to comply with valid legal processes such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, or to protect our rights and property or the rights and property of our customers, web site users or other parties. Comenity also may provide personal information to a purchaser or successor entity in connection with the sale of Comenity, a subsidiary or line of business associated with Comenity, or substantially all of the assets of Comenity or one of its subsidiaries, affiliates or lines of business. Except as permitted by this Policy, Comenity does not disclose personal information provided to us on-line to third parties. 

**How your information is protected**

Comenity takes measures to prevent unauthorized intrusion to its web site and the alteration, acquisition or misuse of personal information by unauthorized persons. However, Comenity cautions visitors to its web site that no medium of communication, including the Internet, is entirely secure. Accordingly, we cannot be responsible for loss, corruption or unauthorized acquisition and use of personal information provided to our web site, or for any damages resulting from such loss, corruption, unauthorized acquisition or unauthorized use. 

#### Links to other sites

We provide links to external sites as a convenience to our users. The inclusion of any link does not imply our endorsement of the external site company, its web site, or the products and services it promotes and sells. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. We encourage users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each web site that collects personally identifiable information.
