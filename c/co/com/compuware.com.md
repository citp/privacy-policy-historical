# Compuware Privacy Statement

## Our Commitment to Privacy 

Compuware Corporation recognizes your right to confidentiality and is committed to protecting your privacy. 

You can visit Compuware online without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. However, customer support areas are restricted and require an ID and password. Our web server only collects domain names, and not the email addresses of our visitors. We use this information to study traffic patterns to our site—when people visit, the number of pages viewed, average time spent, most frequently visited areas, etc. This analysis is helpful for improving the content and structure of our site. 

This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Compuware owned web sites.

## The Information We Collect

### E-mail to a Friend

## The Way We Use Information 

**At no time will Compuware, sell, trade, rent or distribute personal information to any outside organization.** We use e-mail addresses to send requested information and respond to the e-mail we receive. Information such as name, title and company information is used to determine the demographics of our audience and help us to present the information of most value to those who visit.
