            <p>Protecting your privacy is important to Commerce and to our employees. 
              We want you to understand what information we collect and how we 
              use it. In order to provide our customers with a broad range of 
              financial products and services as effectively and conveniently 
              as possible, we use technology to manage and maintain customer information. 
              This policy serves as a standard for all Commerce employees for 
              collection, use, retention, and security of nonpublic personal information. 
            </p>
            <p><b>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b> </p>
            <p>We collect and use different types of information to service your 
              accounts and to offer you better products and services that best 
              meet your changing needs. </p>
            <p> "Nonpublic personal information" is information about you and 
              identified with you that we obtain in connection with providing 
              a financial product or service to you. This is information which 
              is unobtainable from a public source. For example, nonpublic personal 
              information includes information regarding your account balance, 
              payment history, and overdraft history.
            </p><p> We may collect "nonpublic personal information" about you from 
              the following sources: 
            </p><ul>
              <li> Information we receive from you on applications or other loan 
                and account forms; 
              </li><li> Information about your transactions with us, our Affiliates, 
                or others; and 
              </li><li> Information we receive from third parties such as credit bureaus. 
            </li></ul>
            <p> REST ASSURED, WE DO NOT SELL YOUR NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION 
              TO OTHERS.</p>
            <p> 
            </p><blockquote><b>NOTE:</b> Protecting the privacy and security of your 
              confidential financial information is our top priority. The FBI 
              has received complaints involving unsolicited e-mails directing 
              consumers to a phony “customer service” Web site or directly asking 
              for customer information. These scams may result in identity theft, 
              credit card fraud, or other fraudulent financial schemes. Commerce 
              Bank offers secure e-mail for personal questions, requests, and 
              information through an Online Banking account. If you suspect that 
              the security of your accounts has been compromised due to information 
              you've disclosed, please contact our Customer Care Center at 1-800-453-2265. 
            </blockquote><p></p>
            <p><b>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>
            <p> We restrict access to your nonpublic personal information to those 
              employees who need to know that information to provide products 
              or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and/or procedural 
              safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic 
              personal information.</p>
            <p> <b>WHAT INFORMATION WE DISCLOSE</b></p>
            <p> We may disclose nonpublic personal information to companies that 
              work for us and assist us in providing services to you. We may also 
              disclose information as permitted or required by law. Disclosure 
              of information in these circumstances is detailed below:</p>
            <p> <i>TO SERVICE PROVIDERS AND FOR JOINT MARKETING:</i></p>
            <p> 
            </p><blockquote> We may disclose the following information to third parties 
              that provide services that assist us in servicing your loan or account 
              with us, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, 
              or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing 
              agreements: 
              <ul>
                <li> Information we receive from you on applications or other

                  creditworthiness and your payment history. 
              </li></ul>
              We have strict confidentiality agreements with all outside companies 
              to ensure that they protect your information, and never use it for 
              other purposes.</blockquote><p></p>

              (i.e., third parties that are not members of our corporate family) 
              as permitted by law. For example, we may disclose nonpublic personal 
              information about you to third parties as necessary to process transactions 
              that you have requested or authorized, to government entities in 
              response to subpoenas, and to credit bureaus. We do not disclose 
              any nonpublic personal information about you to any other nonaffiliated 
              third parties, except as permitted by law.
              <p></p></blockquote><p></p>
            <b>SHARING WITH AFFILIATES</b>

              experiences or transactions with you or your account (such as your 
              account balance and your payment history with us) with our Affiliates.

              and money and make it easier for you to do business with us.</p>

            <p> 
            </p><blockquote>If you prefer you may direct us not to share this information 
              with our Affiliates. If this is your choice, call us toll free at
