5.2 A ‘Cookie’ is a small text file that is stored by the browser on your computer, tablet or mobile phone. Websites are able to read and write these files, allowing them store things such as personalisation details or user preferences. By providing this "memory" for the website, they enable it to recognise a user and respond appropriately. Each web domain can only access Cookies stored by that specific web domain, meaning that only the MadeSimple servers can access the Cookies set by the MadeSimple domains.

5.3.2 **Shopping basket cookies:** A cookie is generated when you add an item to you basket. We use this cookie to store each item in your basket which enables us to calculate the total price you pay and to ensure we know what the order is we need to fulfil.

5.3.3 **Anonymous analytics cookies:** Our web analytics software uses this cookie to compile anonymous usage statistics (eg. number of visitors, which pages are visited most etc.). We use this information to measure how well the website is doing and to look for ways to improve your experience.

5.3.4 **Third party social cookies:** A cookie may be generated on some pages of the website, notably our blog, when a user interacts with the embedded social sharing buttons (eg. Likes, Tweets or 1s a post). These cookies are created by the third party social sites and are used to record the action you've taken, such as Liking a page.

## 6\. General Information

6.1 Legal basis for processing Personal Data

MadeSimple is the data controller of your Personal Data.

Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect Personal Data only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you.

If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data). Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

6.2 Where we store your Personal Data

MadeSimple's servers are all based in the United Kingdom ("UK"). If you interact with, join or share your data with MadeSimple in any of the ways explained in this Privacy Policy then:

  * if you are in the UK, your Personal Data will only be processed in the UK
  * if you are not in the UK, your Personal Data will be transferred to, and processed in the UK



We have taken appropriate safeguards to ensure that Personal Data will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 7\. Data Security

Data security is of great importance to The Made Simple Group Limited. To protect your data, we have taken care to put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures in order to safeguard and secure any data collected online. For more information please read our data security policy found [here](https://support.companiesmadesimple.com/article/990-data-security).

## 8\. Data Retention

8.1 We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

8.2 Retention periods vary depending on the type of Personal Data. However, we are legally required to keep basic information about our customers (including contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for six years after they cease being customers, for tax purposes.

8.3 We may also anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes. We can use anonymised information indefinitely without further notice to you.

## 9\. Changes of business ownership and control

9.1 The Made Simple Group Limited may, from time to time, expand or reduce its business and this may involve the sale of certain divisions or the transfer of control of certain divisions to other parties. Data provided by users will, where it is relevant to any division so transferred, be transferred along with that division and the new owner or newly controlling party will, under the terms of this Policy, be permitted to use the Data for the purposes for which it was supplied by you.

9.2 In the event that any data submitted by users will be transferred in such a manner, you will not be contacted in advance and informed of the changes. When contacted you will not be given the choice to have your Data deleted or withheld from the new owner or controller (this does not affect your statutory rights).

## 10\. Changes to this policy

10.1 We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, without notice, as we deem necessary to keep it relevant or where we may be required to update it by law. The most up to date Privacy Policy will be immediately posted on the website.
