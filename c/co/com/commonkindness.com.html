During these registration processes, you may be required to provide certain categories of information, which may include name, address, e-mail address and password information. <br><br>At various other points during your use of the Services, you may be asked to provide information about yourself. For example, you may wish to participate in a survey or a contest. Participation in surveys or contests or the use of other services which require the input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part, and you have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of the Services.&nbsp; Users purchasing products or services through our on-line stores or partners will be required to provide additional information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing addresses. <br>In addition to the information which you actively provide to us by methods such as completing the registration form, we collect information about how you interact with the Services. We collect passive information for purposes such as testing and improving a user's experience with the Services and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners. The types of passive information collected by us include, without limitation, your email address, which type of browser you are using to access the Services, where you go when using the Services and your behavior when using the Services.&nbsp; <br><br>When using the Services, you may sometimes by delivered (or "served") certain content, such as advertisements, directly from third parties. These third parties automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third parties may also cause your computer to download cookies, a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters that uniquely identifies your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their content and to personalize the content they display to you. Doing this allows advertising networks, for example, to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. We do not have access to or control of the cookies or other technologies that may be placed by various third parties. Third parties have no access to your contact information stored with us unless you choose or have chosen to share it with them.&nbsp; <br>When you use the Services, we may send one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely identifies your computer. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you complete using the Services for a particular session. Persistent cookies may be accessed on subsequent uses of the Services. Typically, persistent cookies can be removed by following the help file directions for your web browser, for example.
