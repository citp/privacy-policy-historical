### AWS Canonical ID

COMSOL maintains downloadable images of the latest version of its products on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for you to simplify the download and installation of them on to this platform. To enable this, COMSOL stores your AWS canonical ID on COMSOL’s Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on AWS. An AWS canonical ID is a unique ID assigned to you when you register for an AWS account. Apart from you submitting it as part of your download and installation process, and COMSOL then submitting it to AWS to identify you as a valid AWS account holder, your canonical ID will not be otherwise stored and used by COMSOL. For more information about Amazon Web Services’ privacy policy, please see: <https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/?nc1=f_pr>.

If these systems are breached and your data is compromised as a result of this, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the breach and, where appropriate, notify you about which data may have been compromised. COMSOL will also take other steps to address the breach in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.

### Transfer of Data

COMSOL AB, its affiliates, and subsidiaries are the parties responsible for the management of COMSOL’s jointly-used storage of personal data. Contact information for COMSOL AB can be found at the bottom of this policy. As a global organization, the data you provide to COMSOL may be transferred to or used by affiliates or subsidiaries of COMSOL AB and trusted third parties for the purposes described above, including locations outside the European Economic Area, such as those listed at: <https://www.comsol.com/contact>. COMSOL AB has established various safeguards to protect your data such as binding corporate rules and/or approved European Commission contractual clauses.

### Data Storage Retention

All data that is collected will be stored only as long as is necessary to accomplish the purpose for which it is collected, or as long as is permitted or required by applicable law. Periodically, COMSOL will review its data processing systems to determine whether or not the purposes for the collection and processing of your data remain valid. That determination will be based on factors that include, but are not limited to, whether or not you are still in contact with COMSOL, whether or not any requests made by you to COMSOL have been fulfilled (including any follow-up tasks), whether or not there is a contractual relationship between you and COMSOL, and whether or not there is a contractual or legal basis for continuing to retain your data. Based on that review and any notifications received from data subjects, COMSOL will update its systems. For more information on the purpose for which information is collected, please see Use of Data.

### Cookies, web beacons, local storage, and conversion tracking

The Site stores cookies and web beacons on your web browser, and makes use of web storage and conversion tracking functionality.

Cookies are simple text files containing a string that functions as an identifier of stored data on COMSOL’s servers that is used to retrieve, employ, and present it on the Site. COMSOL uses their own cookies to improve functionality of the Site as well as your user experience. This may include automatically logging you in to access certain functionality, automatically populating forms, automatically presenting relevant and tailored content for your needs, and automatically remembering your email and other web-based preferences. The storage and use of cookies also allow COMSOL to filter out spam, bots and other malicious users and uses of the Site. These COMSOL cookies may be session cookies, which are cookies that are erased when you close your browser, or cookies that have up to a five (5) year retention period. All COMSOL cookie information is controlled by COMSOL and accessed only by COMSOL.

COMSOL also uses third party cookies on its Site for functionality, enhancing user experience, and marketing. The information about third party cookies is controlled by and accessible by those third parties. Third party cookies may be session or permanent cookies. For more information on those third party cookies, including how to disable those non-essential cookies and the privacy policies of those third parties, please see Third Party Tools below.

Similar to cookies, web storage is used to store browsing-relevant data on a local database within your browser. It is used to remember the state your browsing history was in the last time you were on the Site. This includes remembering view preferences such as your last sorting of lists, allowing your videos to continue playing from where they last left off, and recovering your in-progress comments or posts on the Site’s forums.

COMSOL may also use web beacons on the Site or in emails sent to you. These are HTML elements, for example images, loaded from a web server passing along an identifier with the load request. Web beacons are used to monitor your navigation when visiting the Site or when opening specific emails.

COMSOL also uses conversion tracking (also known as tracking links) in emails or on the Site or third-party sites to record and transmit which link, element, or component on a webpage or in an email was used by you.

These tools make it possible for us to improve the effectiveness of our messages and provide you with better tailored information on the Site and in email communications. You can configure your browser to deny the storage and/or and use of cookies, web beacons, local storage, and conversion tracking. Some webpages and features on the Site may not be made available or able to function if storage and/or use of this data are denied. For more information on how third-parties store and use data accessed through cookies, web beacons, local storage, and conversion tracking, see the section on Third Party Tools, Sites, and Services.
