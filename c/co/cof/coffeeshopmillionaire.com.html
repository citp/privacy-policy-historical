				information is voluntarily submitted by our visitors. We may use your personal information,
				transfer your personal information, and/or sell your personal information for any legal purpose,
				including, without limitation: (1) to deliver the products and/or services to you that you have
				requested; (2) to validate your compliance with the terms and conditions; (3) for content
				improvement and feedback purposes; (4) to reach you, when necessary, regarding your use of
				the web site or product(s); and (5) to bring retail opportunities and promotional offers to you by

				with outside records to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and/or to
				offer you targeted advertising and other opportunities to purchase products and services that we
				believe may be of interest to you.</p>
				
				<p>We will NEVER share your credit card information with third parties unless you have given us
				explicit permission to do so, such as in order to fulfill a third party offer that you have accepted
				from us. By permitting us to collect this information, you will be able to receive free information
				on products and services that may be of interest to you. You also enable us to personalize your
				experience with us so that we can provide you with the highest quality of service. By submitting
				your email address on this web site, you agree to receive email from us and our third party
				advertisers. We, and our third party advertisers, may maintain separate email lists for different
				purposes. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking the
				opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send
				emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party.
				We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do.</p>
				
				<p>In addition, you agree that by submitting your email address on this web site and/or registering
				to receive the product and/or service offered herein, such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry,
				and/or an application for the purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (ATSR), 16
				CFR '310 et seq. and any applicable state and local "do not call" regulations. We and our third
				party advertisers retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the ATSR
				and the applicable state regulations.</p>
				
				<h4>Third Party Actions</h4>
				
				<p>We do not control and are not liable for the actions of our third party marketers or advertisers.
				We pride ourselves in working with quality companies, but have no control over the actions
				of those third parties. While we are not liable for any of the actions of those third parties, you
				should feel free to give us feedback from time to time on your experiences with any third parties
				to whom we work with so that we may enhance our future service to all customers.</p>

				gather broad demographic information, and to offer you products and services.</p>
				
				<h4>Third Party Web Sites</h4>
				<p>This web site and/or the products and/or services offered herein may direct you to web sites that
				are owned and/or controlled by third parties. We have no control over those third parties and are
				not responsible for the content or the privacy practices of those sites or companies.</p>
				
				<h4>Commitment to Data Security</h4>
				<p>All information collected from you is stored in a technically and physically secure environment.
				We use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, and we do everything we can
				to protect user information offline. Unfortunately, no transmission over the Internet can be
				guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we take reasonable measures to protect your
