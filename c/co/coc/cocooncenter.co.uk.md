The use of social networks and services of COCOONCENTER in relation to these social networks is likely to lead to the collection and exchange of certain data between social networks and COCOONCENTER. We invite you to consult the policies of personal data protection of social networks in order to obtain precise knowledge of the information which is collected by the social networks and which can be transmitted to COCOONCENTER in connection with its sites and applications as well as the purposes of use of your data, especially for advertising purposes. You will be able to configure directly on the social networks the access and the confidentiality of your data. COCOONCENTER collects on its behalf certain information and personal data related to your activity on the pages of COCOONCENTER social networks which use the services of social networks. This data is used for advertising purposes in order to improve our commercial relationship and the advertising addressed to you in order to offer you a personalised and social experience. The information collected by COCOONCENTER for its own account through COCOONCENTER applications, sites or services in connection with social networks are governed by these terms and conditions, and by the specific terms and conditions of the COCOONCENTER applications. **However, COCOONCENTER is not liable for the use made of your data by social networks regarding your own account.**

### "Plug-ins" and social modules

Our site uses "plug-ins" or social modules. These include little buttons such as "like", "share" by third-party social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. which you will find on our websites. They allow you to like and share information from our websites and apps with your friends on social networks. When you consult a page of our COCOONCENTER sites (web or mobile) containing plug-ins or social modules, a connection is established with the servers of the social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) which are then informed that you have accessed the corresponding page of the COCOONCENTER site, even if you do not have a Facebook or Twitter user account, and even if you are not connected to your Facebook or Twitter account. For example, if you are connected to a social network when you visit www.cocooncenter.co.uk, the social networks you are connected to may mention your visit to your account on those social networks. If you use the plug-ins (e.g. like), your actions can be recorded and published on your accounts in the social networks according to the setting of your social network account. If you do not want social networks to post your actions from plug-ins to your social network accounts, you must sign out of your social networks before visiting our site.

In order to comply with the current regulations on the protection of personal data at all times, this privacy policy is reviewed annually by our services.
