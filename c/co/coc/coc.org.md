**How do I know my credit card information is secure?**

The Center of Concern uses secure server software (SSL) that is the industry standard and is among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. In the event of an unauthorized charge to your credit card you must 1) write to the creditor at the address given for "billing inquiries," not the address for sending your payments, and include your name, address, account number and a description of the billing error, 2) send your letter so that it reaches the creditor within 60 days after the first bill containing the error was mailed to you. 

**What do I do if I have questions that aren't answered here?**

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site or your dealings with this website, please contact us.

Changes to this policy will always be posted and public. If any changes are made to the type of information we collect or to the ways in which we use that information, clear, specific instructions will be provided on how you may opt out of new practices.
