##  CoCo RaHS Privacy Statement

We will not give out personal information such as your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address to any other group or entity unless we are legally required to do so. We use mailing list processing software to do bulk e-mail which hides your e-mail address from casual users. We cannot guarantee that this information cannot be extracted by software on some other system as messages are sent over the Internet. 

Your Station Name, Station Number, Longitude, Latitude and precipitation data are public information used in our mapping and reporting software and are therefore available to anyone using the web site. Your station will be identified on a map that could be used to pinpoint your actual location, however our maps are generally not detailed enough to allow this. 

We do occasionally give out our station list to other weather related scientific groups. This list contains Station Name, Station Number, Longitude, Latitude, City, and County. The only current example of this is that we regularly give this information to the National Weather Service for use in their severe weather tracking system. If any observer enters a Quick Hail Report or Intense Rain Report, that information is immediately sent to the NWS to alert them of a possible weather threat.

Any data that you enter into our database is considered the property of the Colorado Climate Center and may be used for any purpose.

For information on our use of cookies, check our [cookies FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20040608193650id_/http%3A//www.cocorahs.org/howto/FAQ/cookies.htm).
