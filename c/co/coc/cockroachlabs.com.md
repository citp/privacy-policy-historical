## Privacy Policy

_Last Revised: February 6, 2019_

Cockroach Labs, Inc. (“ **CRL** ,” “ **we** ,” or “ **us** ”) provides this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) to explain how we collect, use and disclose personally identifiable information (“ **Personal Information** ”) about you when you visit or use any of the websites owned or operated by CRL (collectively, the “ **Sites** ”), any of our products or services that you can access, download, or use via the Sites (collectively, the “ **Services** ”), or when you otherwise interact with us. By visiting or using the Sites or any of our Services, you consent to our collection, use, disclosure, and processing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services, products, or applications, even if they are accessible through our Sites or the Services.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this Privacy Policy, adding a statement to our homepage, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about our practices.

We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to use the Services or send any Personal Information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us Personal Information, please contact us at [info@cockroachlabs.com](mailto:info@cockroachlabs.com).

#### Information We Collect

##### Information You Provide to Us

We collect any Personal Information that you give us. For example, we collect Personal Information about you when you sign up for one of our Services, create an account, participate in any interactive features of the Sites or the Services, fill out a form, give us feedback, ideas or submissions about any of the Services, communicate with us via third party social media sites, request customer support, register for white papers, web seminars, and other events hosted by us, or otherwise communicate with us via the Sites, the Services, or any other means.

The types of Personal Information we may collect include your name, email address, credit/debit card information, as well as any other Personal Information you choose to provide to us. For information about ways to limit our collection of your Personal Information, please see the “ **Account Information** ” section below. If you choose not to provide certain Personal Information, you understand that we may not be able to provide certain of our Services to you, and that certain features of our Sites or Services may be unavailable or work differently.

##### **Personal Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Sites or the Services**

When you access or use the Sites or use the Services (or certain portions of the Sites or Services), we automatically collect certain Personal Information about you. This information includes:

**Log Information** : We log Personal Information from your use of the Sites and the Services, including the type of device you use, access times, IP address, pages viewed, and the page you visited before navigating to one of our Sites and/or using the Services. We use this information for analytics and product improvement purposes.

**Device Information** : We collect Personal Information about the computer or device you use to access the Sites and the Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version and unique device identifiers. We use this information for analytics and product improvement purposes.

**Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies** : We use various technologies to collect Personal Information, including cookies and web beacons. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory, while web beacons (also known as “ **tracking pixels** ”) are non-visible electronic images. These technologies are used for analytics and product improvement purposes, such as seeing which areas and features of our Sites and Services are popular, or determining whether an email has been opened and acted upon. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see the “ **Cookies** ” section below.

**Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy** : Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.

#### Personal Information We Collect From Other Sources

We may obtain Personal Information about you from other sources, and combine that with information we collect through your access and use of our Sites and the Services. For example, if you create or log into your account through a site like Google.com or GitHub.com, we may have access to certain information about you from those sites, such as your name, log-in credentials, account information, and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by those sites. We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources like telephone or fax, or from companies that provide our products and services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer their products and/or services on our website (“ **Third Party Companies** ”). Our Third Party Companies may supply us with Personal Information, such as your calendars and address book information, in order to help us establish the account. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our website in order to improve the products and services we provide.

##### Personal Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Sites or the Services:

  * Provide, deliver, maintain, test and improve our Sites and Services;
  * Send you technical notices, updates, confirmations, security alerts and support and administrative messages;
  * Respond to your comments, questions, and requests, and to provide customer service;

However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.

These third parties will only have access to your Personal Information as necessary to perform their functions, and may not use your Personal Information for any other purpose.

**Analytics Services** : We may use third parties to provide analytics services in connection with the Sites or Services (or portions of the Sites or Services). These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Sites and Services, including, among other things, your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. We may use this information to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, personalize the user experience, and better understand your activity.

**Business Transfers** : We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. In addition, we may disclose Personal Information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into a financing with respect to CRL. We may also share your Personal Information between and among CRL and our current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries and other companies under common control and ownership.

**Compelled Disclosures** : We may disclose your Personal Information to government or law enforcement officials or to private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to:

  3. to protect the safety of the public or any person;
  4. to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity;
  5. to comply with applicable law or regulation; or

**Protection of Us and Others** : We may also share your Personal Information as needed to enforce our terms of use with respect to the Sites or the Services and/or to protect the rights, property and safety of CRL or others.

Finally, we may share Personal Information with your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you through any of the Services that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner, and you choose to provide such information.
