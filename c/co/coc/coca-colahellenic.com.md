### Are your personal data transferred outside the EU?

Since Coca‑Cola HBC operates in many countries, your personal data, in particular the data which you upload through the Careers section of the Site, may be accessed by staff or suppliers in, transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside the EU in which data protection laws may be of a lower standard than in the EU. However we always seek to ensure that your personal data receives the same level of protection as it would had it stayed within the EU, including seeking to ensure that it is kept secure and used only in accordance with our instructions and for the agreed purpose(s). 

Certain countries outside the EU have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EU data protection laws and therefore no additional safeguards are required to export personal information to these jurisdictions (see the full list here <http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm>). In countries which have not had these approvals (such as Russia), we will either ask for your consent to the transfer or transfer it subject to European Commission approved contractual terms that impose equivalent data protection obligations directly on the recipient unless we are permitted under applicable data protection law to make such transfers without such formalities.

Please contact us as set out in Contact us section below if you would like to see a copy of the specific safeguards applied to the export of your personal data.

All of the parties outside the EU to which personal data will be transferred process data, fulfil and deliver orders and provide support services on our behalf. We may also pass aggregate information on the usage of our site to third parties but this will not include information that can be used to identify you. We reserve the right to disclose your personal data as required by law, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, request from a regulator or any other legal process served on us.

Unless required to do so by law, we will not otherwise share, sell or distribute any of the personal data you provide to us without your consent.

Finally, if our business enters into a joint venture with or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your data will be disclosed to our new business partners or owners.

## How we protect your personal data

### Users aged 16 and under

If you are aged 16 or under, please get your parent's or guardian's permission before you provide any personal data to us. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal data.

### Other websites

Our website contains links to other websites which are outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy and Cookie Notice. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their Privacy Policies, which may differ from ours.

We encourage you to read the privacy and cookie notices and terms and conditions of any linked, referenced, or interfacing websites you enter before you submit any personal data to such third party websites.

### Security of data collected and data retention

We employ strict physical, electronic, and administrative security measures to protect your data from access by unauthorised persons and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage both online and offline. We will retain your data for as long as necessary for said purpose of the collection and after that we will retain your data as long as the law requires.

CCHBC retains personal data in an identifiable format only for the interval that is necessary as identified by the purposes of processing for which data are collected.

CCHBC must not keep personal data for longer than necessary to fulfill the identified lawful business purposes or as long as required by applicable law. 

CCHBC establishes a personal data retention period in accordance with relevant laws and regulations as part of the record of processing activities. 

CCHBC must justify the requirements to retain personal data for periods longer than the maximum retention period as per business and regulatory requirements if required. 

Some data must be retained in order to protect the company's interests, preserve evidence, and generally conform to good business practices. Some reasons for data retention include:

  * Litigation
  * Accident investigation
  * Security incident investigation
  * Regulatory requirements
  * Intellectual property preservation
