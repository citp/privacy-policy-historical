# CocaColaHellenic - Privacy statement

Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A is committed to preserving the privacy of all visitors to [www.coca-colahellenic.com](http://www.coca-colahellenic.com/) and to protecting any personal information that you may provide to us. In particular, we believe it is important for you to know how we treat information about you that we may receive from this website and how we carry out data processing practices through the use of the Internet and any other electronic communications networks. Please read the following Privacy Policy to understand how we use and protect the information that you provide to us or how we may use and protect it in the future.

By registering for any services on this site, you consent to the collection, use and transfer of your information under the terms of this policy.

## Information that we collect from you

In general, you can visit this website without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. In addition, there are parts of this website where we may need to collect personal information from you for a specific purpose, such as to provide you with certain information you request and where requested to register you to our website. We do this through the use of online forms and every time you e-mail us your details. The information collected from you may include your name, address, telephone, fax number, or e-mail address. You will find that it is not compulsory to provide us with any additional information we request which is not necessary or reasonable in order to provide you with the services you have requested. We may also collect information about you from e-mails or letters you send to us.

## Use of information collected

Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our site and to improve its content.

When other personal information, such as your name and e-mail address, is collected from you with your consent (for example, through the use of on-line forms or via e-mail) we generally let you know at the time of collection how we will use that personal information. We may also use the personal information you provide or which we collect via this website for the purposes of:

  * Providing any services that you have requested from us such as to receive Investor Relations information/copies of our Annual Reports, to subscribe to the corporate web-cast service or to subscribe to our e-mail alert service.
  * Responding to your inquiries or to process your requests in relation to your information.
  * Providing and personalising our services.
  * Administering subscription-service records.



If you change your mind about being contacted in the future, please let us know.

## Disclosures

The information you provide to us will be held on a server in UK and may be accessed by or given to our staff working outside UK and to third parties, including companies within the Coca-Cola Hellenic Group, to business partners, government bodies and law enforcement agencies, successors in title to our business and suppliers we engage to process data on our behalf, some of whom may be located outside the European Economic Area, who act for us for the purposes set out in this policy or for other purposes approved by you. In particular, please note that if you sign up for our corporate web-cast service, we will ask you to provide your consent to us passing your personal information to our web-cast agency in the USA in order for them to provide you with these services on our behalf. All of the parties mentioned above process information, fulfil and deliver orders and provide support services on our behalf. We may also pass aggregate information on the usage of our site to third parties but this will not include information that can be used to identify you.

Finally, if our business enters into a joint venture with or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed to our new business partners or owners.

Countries outside the European Economic Area do not always have strong data protection laws. However, we will always take steps to ensure that your information is used by third parties in accordance with this policy.

Unless required to do so by law, we will not otherwise share, sell or distribute any of the information you provide to us without your consent.

## Users 16 and under

If you are aged 16 or under, please get your parent's or guardian's permission before you provide any personal information to us. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information.

## Other websites

Our website may contain links to other websites which are outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their Privacy Policies, which may differ from ours.

## Security of information collected and data retention

We employ strict physical, electronic, and administrative security measures to protect your information from access by unauthorized persons and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage both on-line and off-line. We will retain your information for a reasonable period or as long as the law requires.

## Internet-based transfers and disclaimer

Given that the Internet is a global environment, using a website to collect and process personal information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by browsing this website and communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge and agree to our processing of personal information in this way.

Whereas Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A employs reasonable measures to protect against viruses and other harmful components, the nature of the Internet is such that it is impossible to ensure that your access to the website will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that this website, its servers or e-mails which may be sent by us are free of viruses or other harmful components.

The contents of this website are designed to comply with the general obligations of the European Directive on Data Protection. We cannot be responsible for non-compliance with any local advertising or other laws in relation to this website or its contents.

You are entitled to see the personal information we hold about you and you may ask us to make any necessary changes to ensure that it is accurate and kept up to date. If you wish to do this, please contact us using the contact details provided at the [Contact us](https://web.archive.org/contacts/) page. We are entitled by law to charge a small administrative fee to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.
