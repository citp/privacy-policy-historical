        of visitors (<b>"Visitors," "you"</b>) to our Internet 
        world wide web site (<b>the "Site"</b>) that links directly 
        to this privacy policy<nobr></nobr> about the protection of personal information 
        online. This privacy policy (<b>the "Policy"</b>) describes 
        our practices regarding the privacy of information that we collect through 
        the Site, which is hosted and operated from the United States. This Policy 
        does not govern our collection of information through any web site, or 
        by any other means, other than through the Site, or the collection of 
        information by any parent, subsidiaries, sponsors or affiliated companies 
        (<b>"Affiliated Entities"</b>).</p>
      <p>For individuals who are located in the European Union, you should be 
        aware that The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company abides by the Safe Harbor framework agreed 
        to by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union (EU) with 
        respect to personal information collected by entities located in the EEA

      <p>We 
        encourage you to read this Policy before using our Site. By using the Site, you 
        agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms 
        and conditions of this Policy, please do not use the Site.</p>
      <p><b>1. Information 
        The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company Gathers Through the Site.</b></p>
      <p>The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company gathers two basic types of information through the Site: "Personal 
        Information," information from which an individual can be identified, and 
        "Aggregate Information," from which an individual can not be identified.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>a. Aggregate Information. </b>When you visit and interact with the Site, 
          The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company and third parties with whom The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company has contracted to provide services to The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company, 
          may collect anonymous information from three sources: server log files, cookies, 
          and "pixel tags".</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p> <b>i. Server Log Files. </b>Your 
            Internet Protocol (IP) address is an identifying number that is automatically 
            assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number 
            is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit 
            the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. 
            We use the IP addresses of all Visitors to calculate Site usage levels, to help 
            diagnose problems with the Site's servers, and to administer the Site. We may 
            also use IP addresses to communicate or to block access by Visitors who fail to 
            comply with our Terms of Service. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice 
            on the Internet and is carried out automatically by many web sites.</p>
          <p>.<b>ii. 
            Cookies.</b> Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual's computer 
            for recordkeeping purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by most web 
            sites, and help facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of a particular web 
            site. Cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files, and only 
            the web site that transferred a particular cookie to you can read, modify or delete 
            such cookie. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, 
            there are simple procedures in most browsers that allow you to delete existing 
            cookies, to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining 
            or accepting the transfer of particular cookies to your computer. You should note, 
            however, that declining cookies may make it difficult or impossible for you to 
            use portions of the Site.</p>
          <p> <b>iii. Pixel Tags.</b> The Site may use so-called 
            "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar 
            means (collectively, <b>"Pixel Tags"</b>) to compile aggregate statistics 
            about Site usage and response rates. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have 
            visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help determine 
            the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted 
            email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the email has 
            been opened.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> <b>b. Personal Information.</b> You are not ordinarily 
          required to register or provide Personal Information in order to access our Site, 
          though certain functionalities (such as a membership program, through which purchasers 
          of products may receive discounts on online purchases) may require registration. 
          We collect Personal Information from you only when you voluntarily provide it 
          to us - for example, in contacting us through the Site, answering surveys and 
          polls, entering contests, sweepstakes, raffles and similar promotions, signing 
          up for email updates and announcements concerning our products and special promotions, 
          and purchasing The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company merchandise. Personal Information 
          may include your contact information (such as your name, postal address, telephone 
          numbers and/or email address), as well as your payment information, such as credit 
          card number and expiration date (<b>"Payment Information"</b>), which 
          we collect if you wish to purchase any product or service made available through 
          the Site (<b>"Transaction"</b>).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b>2. Use and Disclosure 
        of Information The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company Gathers Through the Site.</b></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <b>a. Personal Information.</b> We may use your Personal Information in any 
          of the following ways.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><b>i. Communications. </b>We encourage 
            Visitors to contact us with questions and comments. Personal Information may be 
            used in order to respond to your questions and comments.</p>
          <p> <b>ii. Business 
            Purposes. </b>We may also use your Personal Information for internal business 
            purposes, such as analyzing and managing our businesses. The Personal Information 
            you provide through the Site may be combined with other information you provide 
            to The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company (via online or offline means), with demographic 
            information and other information that is publicly available, or with other information 
            about you that The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company may otherwise obtain online 
            or offline.</p>
          <p> <b>iii. Transactions.</b> When you take part in a Transaction 
            through the Site such as purchasing <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> merchandise, we may 
            collect Payment Information from you related to such Transaction as well as other 
            Personal Information such as a shipping address so that we can send you the products 
            you have purchased. We may use your Personal Information or Payment Information 
            in order to complete the Transaction and, if applicable, to fulfill your purchase. 
            We may also provide such Payment Information to third parties as necessary to 
            complete your Transaction (for example, to process your credit card).</p>
          <p><b>iv. 
            Sweepstakes, contests, raffles and other promotions.</b> We may operate sweepstakes, 
            contests, raffles and similar promotions through the Site that may require online 
            registration (which may include name, email, user ID and password). We typically 
            ask you for certain Personal Information when you enter and, if applicable, win 
            a sweepstakes, contest, raffle or similar promotion. We may share this Personal 
            Information with third parties sponsors of such sweepstakes, contests, raffles 
            and promotions (irrespective of whether it is hosted by us), or otherwise in accordance 
            with the rules applicable to such sweepstakes, contest, raffle or promotion. You 
            should carefully review the rules of each sweepstakes, contest, raffle and promotion 
            in which you participate through the Site, as they may contain additional important 
            information about The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company's or a sponsor's use of your 
            Personal Information. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules 
            concerning the treatment of your Personal Information conflict with this Policy, 
            the terms and conditions of such rules shall control.</p>
          <p><b>v.</b> <b>Special 
            Promotions and Product Information.</b> In addition, The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company may use your Personal Information to provide you with email updates and 
            announcements concerning our products and special promotions. You may opt-out 
            of receiving these messages from us at any time (see "<i>Contact Us</i>" 
            below). </p>
          <p><b>vi. Critical Communications.</b> From time to time we may use 
            your Personal Information to email you important information regarding the Site, 
            your Transactions, or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies (<b>"Critical 
              Emails"</b>). Because this information may be critical to your use of the 
            Site, you may not opt-out of receiving these emails.</p>
          <p><b>vii. Third Party 
            Service Providers.</b> We work with third parties who provide services, including 
            web site hosting, credit card processing, data analysis, newsletter services, 
            promotional activities, and other administrative services. We may share your Personal 
            Information, including your Payment Information, with such third parties for the 
            purpose of enabling such third parties to provide such services.</p>
          <p> <b>viii. 
            Miscellaneous.</b> Finally, we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe 
            that we are required to do so: (i) by law; (ii) to comply with legal process or 
            governmental requests; (iii) to enforce our Terms of Service; (iv) to protect 
            our operations; (v) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company, you or others; and (vi) to permit us to pursue 
            available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><b>b. 
          Aggregate Information.</b> We analyze Aggregate Information in order to enhance 
          web site security, track the popularity of certain pages of the Site, the success 
          of our email notifications, traffic levels on the Site and other usage data, all 
          of which helps us to provide content tailored to your interests, improve the Site 
          and related services and to otherwise enhance your experience on the Site. We 
          may share Aggregate Information with Affiliated Entities and other third parties.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b>3. 
        Other Important Notes Regarding Our Privacy Practices.</b></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <b>a. Special Note for Parents. </b>The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company takes seriously 
          its obligations under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act concerning 
          the collection of Personal Information from individuals under the age of thirteen 
          (13). The Site is not directed at children, and we request that children under 
          the age of 13 not provide Personal Information through the Site.</p>
        <p>.<b>b. Security. </b>We have security measures and tools in place to help protect against the loss, 
          misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Any time you provide 
          us with your credit card number, that credit card number is transmitted to us 
          by your browser in an encrypted format using industry-standard, SSL (secure socket 
          layer) encryption. No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure. 
          As a result, although we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot 
          guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us through or in connection 
          with the Site. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is 
          no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you 
          might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the 
          problem by contacting us in accordance with "<i>Contact Us,</i>" below 
          (note that physical mail notification will delay the time it takes for us to respond 
          to the problem). </p>
        <p><b>c. Other Third Party Sites. </b>The Site may contain 
          links to third party web sites. These linked sites (including the web sites of 
          Affiliated Entities) are not under The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company's control 
          and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such 
          linked site, or any link contained in any linked site. We provide such links only 
          as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement 
          of the linked site by The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company. If you provide Payment 
          Information or other Personal Information through any such third party web site, 
          your transaction will occur on such third party's web site (not the Site) and 
          the Personal Information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the 
          privacy policy of, that third party. It is important that you familiarize yourself 
          with the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties.</p>
        <p><b>d. 
          Assignment.</b> We reserve the right to transfer any and all information that 
          we collect from users of the Site to a third party in the event of any merger, 
          sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion 
          of The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company's assets or stock (including without limitation 
          in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b>4. 
        Updating Your Information and Contacting Us.</b>The <nobr>Coca-Cola</nobr> Company has procedures in place to keep your Personal Information accurate, complete 
        and up to date for the purposes for which it is collected and used. You may review
