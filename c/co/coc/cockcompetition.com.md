_Other sites_.  This Policy only applies to services offered by cockcompetition.com.  cockcompetition.com is not able to exercise control over sites that are linked to from within our various Services.  These other sites may collect data, set their own cookies in users’ browsers, or ask users to provide personal information.  
cockcompetition.com may use this information to provide, maintain, protect and improve the services it offers users.  cockcompetition.com may also use this information to protect its rights or the rights of its users.  Any of this information may be disclosed or otherwise used in any manner cockcompetition.com sees fit with regard to investigating and stopping the suspected or actual piracy of copyrighted content.

If cockcompetition.com must use any personal information in a manner different from those described, it will seek your consent prior to that use.  cockcompetition.com possesses personal information in the United States and in other countries, and in some cases may store personal information outside of your country.

**Information Sharing**

cockcompetition.com will share personal information with companies or individuals outside of cockcompetition.com under limited circumstances:

-cockcompetition.com has obtained your consent to release personal information.

-The information is being shared with a subsidiary or cockcompetition.com affiliate.

-Access, use or distribution of your personal information is, in cockcompetition.com’s good faith belief, reasonably required to a) satisfy an applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable government request (e.g. a warrant, subpoena or other court order), b) enforce the Terms and Conditions, and investigate their breach, c) detect and prevent security issues, d) protect against harm to cockcompetition.com or its users, and e) to pursue good faith allegations of piracy brought by cockcompetition.com or third parties.
