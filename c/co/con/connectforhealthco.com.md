# Privacy Policy - Connect for Health Colorado

## Connect for Health Colorado Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy is very important to us. We’re telling you about Connect for Health Colorado’s privacy policy so you know what information we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it.

Connectforhealthco.com doesn’t collect any personally identifiable information (PII) about you during your visit to our website unless you choose to provide it to us. We do, however, collect information from visitors who read, browse, and/or download information from our site. We do this so we can understand how the public uses the site and how to make it more helpful. We will not knowingly disclose your personal information to a third party, except as provided in this statement.

## Types of information we collect

Connect for Health Colorado (the Marketplace) will keep the information you provide private as required by law. The information you provide will be used for the purposes of enrollment in a plan; treatment; payment; determining eligibility; or other purposes permitted by law.

As part of the process, we will communicate with you or your authorized representative, and then provide the information to the health plan you select so that they can enroll those who are eligible in a qualified health plan. Information on race and ethnicity will not be provided to the insurance carriers, unless you are an American Indian or Alaska Native because that information could positively affect your benefits. We will verify your answers using information in our electronic databases and the databases of partner agencies. If the information you provide does not match these sources, we may ask you to send us proof of the information you provide.

Health insurance carriers can no longer deny coverage based on your health status.  Households that are not seeking financial assistance and have members who are not seeking insurance will not be asked questions about citizenship or immigration status.

If you don’t have an exemption from the shared responsibility payment and you don’t maintain qualifying health insurance for three months or longer during the year, you may be subject to a federal penalty.

**Important** : Connect for Health Colorado is authorized to collect information on the application, including Social Security numbers, and will confirm information that may affect initial or ongoing eligibility for all persons listed on your application. You are allowing Connect for Health Colorado to use Social Security numbers and other information from your application to request and receive information or records to confirm the information in your application.   You release Connect for Health Colorado from all liability for sharing this information with other agencies for this purpose. For example, Connect for Health Colorado may get and share your information with any of the following agencies: Social Security Administration; United States Customs and Immigration Services; Department of Homeland Security; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; other federal or state agencies; and Agents/Brokers and managing general agencies contracting with those agents/brokers, as applicable, which are certified by the Marketplace to assist applicants/enrollees. We need this information to check your eligibility for health insurance and to give you the best service possible if you choose to apply. Regulations that support getting this data can be found  under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152), the Social Security Act, and Colorado S.B. 11-200, the Colorado Health Benefit Exchange Act, codified at C.R.S. § 10-22-101.

We may use the information you provide in computer matching programs with any of the following entities to make eligibility determinations, to verify continued eligibility for enrollment in a qualified health plan, or to process appeals of eligibility determinations:

  * Other verification sources including consumer reporting agencies;
  * Applicants/enrollees, and authorized representatives of applicants/enrollees;
  * Issuers of qualified health plans, as applicable, which are certified by Colorado Division of Insurance;
  * Agents and brokers, as designated or nominated by the applicant/enrollee, who are certified by the Marketplace to assist applicants/enrollees;
  * Financial institutions (banks, credit unions, etc.) including Network Merchants, Inc. for all ACH/ credit card payments;
  * Connect for Health Colorado contractors engaged to perform a function for the Marketplace;
  * Anyone else as required by law.



The Marketplace will also use the information you provide as part of the ongoing operation of this organization, including activities such as performing oversight and quality control activities, combatting fraud, and responding to any concerns about the security or confidentiality of the information. If you are already enrolled through Connect for Health Colorado, we may share your information with other organizations or government agencies when necessary to fulfill a required Exchange minimum function, but we do not sell it.

As part of overall performance and effectiveness monitoring, the Marketplace utilizes Google Analytics to identify and track customer activities to analyze communication campaigns, website navigation, and potential bottlenecks.

## Protection of your data

Connect for Health Colorado has significant protections in place to ensure the privacy of your personal information. The Marketplace system is implemented in compliance with federal and state rules, regulations, and laws designed to protect customer information.

You will be asked to provide only the minimum information necessary to determine eligibility for relevant health plan options. Multiple layers of physical, administrative, and electronic protections have been put in place to protect all information from unauthorized use, access, or malicious activity. Personnel procedures and processes have been developed with an emphasis on privacy.

Connect for Health Colorado (and contractors) adhere to standards as defined in 45 CFR §155.260. Additionally, our customer-support partners — Health Coverage Guides, Assistance Site staff, certified health insurance agents and brokers, and others — must all comply with and support our security and privacy efforts, including security and privacy training, as part of their agreements. Their access to customer data is restricted based on the roles they serve. For example, Health Coverage Guides will not have access to customer data through the Marketplace. Licensed health insurance agents and brokers will have access to portions of client data, but only after completing a certification process and being authorized by the client. Within our own Customer Service Center, representatives will also receive training, screening, and be subject to controls.

Under ACA regulations, any person who knowingly and willfully uses or discloses information in violation of section 1411(g) of the Affordable Care Act will be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 per person or entity, per use or disclosure, in addition to other penalties that may be prescribed by law.

The Marketplace system is tested, inspected, and audited by independent third parties and federal and state organizations. Effective customer privacy and security are a top priority as part of our overall mission to provide this service to Colorado.

You have the right to see whatever information we have about you. You also have the right to have this information corrected if we have any incorrect information on file.

If you choose to provide us with PII through an email message, request for information, paper or electronic form, questionnaire, survey, etc., we will maintain the information you provide only as long as needed or as required by law.

If in order to contact you we store your personal information in a record system designed to retrieve information about you by personal identifier (name, personal email address, home mailing address, personal or mobile phone number, etc.), we will safeguard the information you provide in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. Section 552a). In the event of a disclosure or breach of unsecured personal information we will notify affected individuals. You may request a paper copy of this notice of disclosure.
