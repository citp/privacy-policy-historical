# Privacy Policy • Connect for Health Colorado

## **Connect for Health Colorado Privacy Policy**

Protecting your privacy is very important to us. This policy tells you why we collect information, what information we collect, and what we do with it. Our website ConnectforHealthCO.com doesn’t collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about you during your visit to our website unless you choose to provide it to us. We do, however, collect non-PII related information from visitors who read, browse, and/or download information from our site. We will not knowingly disclose your personal information to a third party, except as provided in this statement.

By submitting personal information to Connect for Health Colorado (the Marketplace) or by using our website, you agree that we may collect, use and disclose any such personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted or required by law. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not provide your personal information.

### **Why we collect information**

The Marketplace is authorized to collect personal information during your application for health-related benefits and will confirm information that may affect initial or ongoing eligibility for all persons listed on your application. The information you provide is needed for the purposes of determining health insurance eligibility or other purposes permitted by law and to give you the best services possible if you choose to apply.

You are allowing the Marketplace to use Social Security numbers and other PII from your application in order to shop and apply for benefits and you release the Marketplace from all liability for sharing this information with other agencies for this purpose.
