  * **Use of Cookies and Web Beacons.** We (or service providers on our behalf) may automatically collect information from you when you use the Site using “cookies” or “web beacons”. Cookies are small amounts of data that are stored within your computer’s or mobile device’s Internet browser and that are accessed and recorded by the websites that you visit, as well as by the companies that place advertising on websites, so that they can recognize the same browser navigating online at a later time. Web beacons are web page elements that can recognize certain types of information on your computer or mobile device such as cookies and the time and date of a page viewed. Information that may be collected by cookies and web beacons when you use the Site may include, without limitation: 
    * the pages you visit within the Site;
    * the date and time of your visit to the Site;
    * the amount of time you spend using the Site;
    * the websites you visit before or after visiting the Site;
    * the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer or mobile device to the Internet;
    * your computer or mobile device and connection information such as your browser type and version, operating system and platform; and/or
    * your purchase history.

You may be able to set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie. You can also purchase and download software that will allow you to use the Service without providing the information gathered by cookies. You are welcome to use the Service if you use this type of software, but your experience while visiting the Service may not be optimal.

If you choose not to share your location details with us, you may be denied access to the mobile application. 



4.     Information that We Collect when You Receive a Phone Call through the Service. We collect the location of your phone to help ensure accurate billing practices as well as for correctional facilities safety, security and investigative purposes.

**Important Message from your Cellular Provider (AT &T, Cricket, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless and others).** The Service is not a Cellular Provider application. If you use the Service, it may require your Cellular Provider to disclose your customer information, including mobile phone location information, to us or some other third party. By providing your consent through the opt-in process described below, you authorize your Cellular Provider to disclose your information to us and to third parties to enable the Service. Please review this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, located at [ Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20160315032255id_/https%3A//www.connectnetwork.com/learnmore/TermsOfUse.jsp) for more information about how the Service will collect, access, use or disclose your information.

You acknowledge and agree that (1) your relationship with us is separate from your relationship with your Cellular Provider; (2) your Cellular Provider is not responsible for the Service; and (3) you will hold harmless your Cellular Provider and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns from any judgments, claims, actions, losses, liabilities or expenses arising from or attributable to the Service or our acts or omissions. 

You will be advised through a prompt on calls placed from an inmate at a correctional facility to your phone that your phone location information will be obtained. By accepting the call, you agree to have your phone location obtained for 60 minutes after you accept the call. Your location will not be obtained if you do not accept the call. The location information collected in connection with each call will only be stored for one year from the date of the call and then deleted from our records. If you would like to opt out of having your phone location information obtained for any time remaining between when you terminate your call with the inmate and the above referenced 60 minute period, please call 1-800-483-8314.

5.    Information that You Choose to Provide: You may have the option to post reviews of our products and services on the Site. Any review that you post may be viewed by other users of the Service.

B.     Information Collection by Third Parties.  
  
If you visit the Site from a third-party website the third-party website may give you a unique code, cookie or graphic which will uniquely identify you. This will only happen if you link directly from a third party website to the Site. Your activities on the Site while this type of code is active may be reported back to the third party website. The presence of a third party navigation bar at the top of any page on the Site is an indication that the third party website may be able to see your activity on the Site.

The Site may also include third-party advertising, links to other websites, and other content from third-party businesses. These third-party sites, businesses, and advertisers, may use web beacons and cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, personalize or optimize advertising content and to track users who click on the links made available through the Site. These third-parties may use persistent identifiers to track the actions of users online over time and across different websites or platforms to deliver targeted electronic advertisements to an individual user. We do not have access to or control over web beacons, cookies or persistent identifiers that these third parties may use.

We may also use third party analytics software providers to gather and analyze anonymous information about users of the Site. These third party providers may use cookies to collect information about your purchase history, the content you view, what websites you visit immediately prior to and after visiting the Site, and your system information. The information gathered by these third party providers about your use of the Site may be transmitted to and stored by these third party providers. If we use these third party providers, the information collected about you by these third party providers would allow us to analyze your use of the Site and the Service.
