OverDrive respects your privacy.

We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy against new technologies, business practices, and our users’ needs, and may make changes to the Privacy Policy accordingly.

## What is “Personal Information?” 

“Personal Information” is information that can be associated with a specific user and used to identify that person, for example, full name (first and last); a home or other physical address including street name and city or town; phone number; or online contact information such as an email address or screen name. Personal Information may be willingly submitted by you in your interaction with the Services. OverDrive does not collect or access any Personal Information unless you choose to submit it to OverDrive.  Other information, that is not Personal Information, may be collected automatically by visiting and/or using our Services.

## Do I need to provide Personal Information to OverDrive in order to use the Services? 

No, you can use most Services without providing any Personal Information to OverDrive. An OverDrive account is not required to use most Services.  A valid library card is all you need to use most Services.

If you choose to create an OverDrive account, you will be required to submit Personal Information to OverDrive. Please click here to visit the section of this Privacy Policy that applies specifically to your OverDrive account.

## How Does OverDrive Protect my Personal Information? 

OverDrive takes information security very seriously. We have implemented measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your Personal Information. Any Personal Information that that you choose to submit to us is protected by physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure. We encrypt the transmission of sensitive data we collect from visitors of our Services using secure sockets layer (SSL) technology. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption and physical access controls to our buildings and files. We authorize access to Personal Information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.

## What non-personally identifiable information does OverDrive collect?

We collect certain information related to your interactions and use of our Services, including but not limited to, your online activity, digital content selections (e.g. lending history), reviews and ratings, your library, library card number and/or Adobe® ID, Internet Protocol addresses, device types, and unique device data such as device identifiers and operating systems.  Again, OverDrive does not collect or access any Personal Information unless you choose to submit it to OverDrive.

Some Services provide the ability for you to see your digital content selections/lending history. If you are using Libby or the OverDrive app, you will have the option to view your lending history in the app. You can remove your lending history by following the instructions within the app.  Your lending history is private and protected as confidential. We do not share it with any third parties, except (i) to persons acting within the scope of their duties in the administration of your library, or (ii) if compelled to disclose it pursuant to a process, subpoena, or court order after a showing of good cause by the law enforcement agency or person seeking the records and authorized pursuant to a federal, state, or local law relating to civil, criminal, administrative or legislative investigative power.
