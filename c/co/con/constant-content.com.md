# Privacy Policy - Constant-Content.com

Constant-Content Media Company

This statement sets out the privacy practices and policies of Revenuwire Inc. (“Constant-Content”) in relation to any information that you may share with Constant-Content.

Constant-Content reserves the right to update this policy from time to time, on reasonable notice to you. Your continued use of any website or service covered by this policy after we have notified you of an amendment will constitute your agreement to the same.

In this statement, when we talk about “Constant-Content” or “we” or “our”, we are referring to Constant-Content Media Company, and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries.

### 1\. Personal Information

In connection with your use, from time to time, of the Constant-Content website or service, you may be required to provide Constant-Content with certain personal information, including without limitation, your name, address, telephone number, electronic mail addresss, credit card information, bank account information, and your social insurance or social security number (collectively, your “Personal Information”).

Constant-Content will use your Personal Information to establish your account, to communicate with you, to remit payments to you from time to time if and when due, and for ongoing record keeping, as required by law.

Constant-Content will not release Personal Information about you without your permission, except:

  * (a) as permitted in this policy statement; 
  * (b) as permitted in any written agreement between you and Constant-Content; 
  * (c) where we believe it is reasonably necessary to conduct business; and 
  * (d) where we believe it is necessary to enforce our rights under any agreement between you and Constant-Content.



Constant-Content will provide both a means for you to manage and control the information that you have voluntarily provided to us and a means for you to communicate your privacy questions and concerns to us.

We will not knowingly collect Personal Information on users under the age of eighteen. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor the Internet based activities of their children.

When you access any site or service covered by this policy statement, we collect Anonymous Information. We use this information for system administration, to market research (which is shared with our advertisers), to personalize your experience at our site, to show you more relevant advertising messages, and, generally, to improve our services. We share this Anonymous Information with selected advertisers and partners in order to deliver to you more relevant advertising messages.

Constant-Content will not share any Anonymous Information if that information is or will be linked to your Personal Information, unless we have given you notice as described above and you have given us authorization to do so.

Constant-Content can and will use IP addresses to identify users of our site when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our site’s terms of use or terms of service, or to protect our service, site, or other users.

### 3\. Sharing Personal Information

We will not share your Personal Information unless we have first given you notice that we might share your data, and you have authorized us to do so. Our partners who receive information from us have the right to use the data we provide them (sometimes, in connection with other information they may have gathered about you), but are generally prohibited from sharing this information with other companies or people. In addition, if we add new features or services that might require the sharing of your personal information with other parties, we will provide you with notice and the opportunity to opt-in to receive these offers.

In certain special cases, we may disclose your Personal Information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to you, or otherwise injuring or interfering with Constant-Content’s rights, property or operations, other Constant-Content users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose your Personal Information when we believe the law requires it, or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case or administrative investigation.
