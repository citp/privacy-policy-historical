            <p class="lead">OverDrive, Inc. and its affiliates (“OverDrive”, “we”, “us” or “our”) provides digital content, applications,
                technology, services, and hosted websites to third parties. This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices

                Libby and the OverDrive app, and OverDrive accounts (collectively referred to as “Services”).</p>
            <p>OverDrive respects your privacy. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to make you aware of how OverDrive collects,
                manages, protects, uses, and/or shares information and what choices are available to you regarding the collection,
                use and distribution of your Personal Information and non-personally identifiable information.</p>

            <h2>What is “Personal Information?” </h2>
            <p>“Personal Information” is information that can be associated with a specific user and used to identify that person,
                for example, full name (first and last); a home or other physical address including street name and city
                or town; phone number; or online contact information such as an email address or screen name. Personal Information
                may be willingly submitted by you in your interaction with the Services. OverDrive does not collect or access
                any Personal Information unless you choose to submit it to OverDrive. Other information, that is not Personal
                Information, may be collected automatically by visiting and/or using our Services.</p>
            <h2>Do I need to provide Personal Information to OverDrive in order to use the Services? </h2>
            <p>No, you can use most Services without providing any Personal Information to OverDrive. An OverDrive account is
                not required to use most Services. A valid library card is all you need to use most Services.</p>
            <p>If you choose to create an OverDrive account, you will be required to submit Personal Information to OverDrive.
                Please <a href="#createAccount">click here to visit the section of this Privacy Policy that applies specifically
                to your OverDrive account.</a></p>
            <h2>How Does OverDrive Protect my Personal Information? </h2>
            <p>OverDrive takes information security very seriously. We have implemented measures to protect against the loss,
                misuse, and alteration of your Personal Information. Any Personal Information that that you choose to submit
                to us is protected by physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure.
                We encrypt the transmission of sensitive data we collect from visitors of our Services using secure sockets
                layer (SSL) technology. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption and physical access
                controls to our buildings and files. We authorize access to Personal Information only for those employees
                who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.</p>
            <h2>What non-personally identifiable information does OverDrive collect?</h2>
            <p>We collect and store certain information related to your interactions and use of our Services, including but not limited
                to, your online activity, digital content selections (e.g. lending history), reviews and ratings, your library,
                library card number and/or Adobe<sup>®</sup> ID, Internet Protocol addresses, device types, and unique device
                data such as device identifiers and operating systems. Again, OverDrive does not collect or access any Personal
                Information unless you choose to submit it to OverDrive.</p>
            <p>Some Services provide the ability for you to see your digital content selections/lending history.
                If you are using your institution’s OverDrive-hosted website, Libby, or the OverDrive app,
                you will have the option to show your lending history. You can hide your lending history by following
                the instructions within the app or help articles.  Your lending history is protected by OverDrive as
                confidential. It is not shared with any third parties, except to staff with appropriate authority acting
                within the scope of their duties for the administration of your institution (library, school, etc.)
                If we are compelled to disclose your lending history pursuant to a court order or subpoena, or to a
                person or agency with the relevant administrative or legislative investigative power, we will seek to
                challenge and limit the scope and comply with the authorized agency or person only as required by law.

            <h2><a name="whatisglc"></a>What is OverDrive's Get a Library Card Service?</h2>
            <p>OverDrive’s Get a Library Card online service (“GLC”) helps users obtain access to the library’s OverDrive digital collection.
                Only authorized patrons of the library are permitted to access and checkout digital content from the library’s digital collection.</p>
            <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use GLC.  If you use GLC, you will be asked to submit your name and mobile phone number to OverDrive.
                Only U.S. mobile phone numbers are eligible for use with GLC.  The information you submit will be used to confirm your mobile phone number
                is associated with you and to verify that you have an address in your library’s service area.
                Libraries that participate in GLC provide OverDrive with the zip codes that comprise their service area.
                Submitting your name and mobile phone number to GLC confirms your consent to this Privacy Policy and OverDrive’s
                <a class="od-policy" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171119034535id_/https%3A//company.cdn.overdrive.com/policies/terms-and-conditions.htm">Terms and Conditions.</a></p>
            <p>To verify that your address is in your library’s service area, OverDrive will share your name and mobile phone number with a third-party verification service,
                <a target="_blank" href="https://cognitohq.com">Cognito.</a>
                Cognito will use your name and mobile phone number to return an address, if any, to OverDrive. To aid the
                verification process and increase the likelihood that an address is found, you may be asked to submit your date of birth.
                Your date of birth will be shared with Cognito.</p>
            <p>Cognito does not use your name, mobile phone number, or date of birth for marketing or sales purposes,
                nor do they share your name, mobile phone number, or date of birth with third parties for marketing or sales purposes.</p>
            <p>OverDrive will send a text message to the mobile phone number you provide (standard text message rates apply)
                to verify the mobile phone number’s association with you.</p>
            <p>If you are validated as having a residential address within your library’s service area, you will be able to access and
                checkout digital content from your library’s OverDrive digital collection for twelve (12) months from the date you are validated.
                Your name, mobile phone number, and address are stored by OverDrive for the purpose of authenticating your checkouts
                from the library’s OverDrive digital collection. Your date of birth, if submitted to OverDrive, is not stored by OverDrive.
                Unless otherwise permitted through your opt-in consent to receive marketing communications,
                OverDrive does not use your name, mobile phone number, or date of birth for marketing or sales purposes, nor do we share your name,
                mobile phone number, or date of birth with third parties for marketing or sales purposes.</p>
            <p>In addition to obtaining checkout privileges to your library’s digital collection,
                you may also be eligible for a library card for access to your library’s additional resources (e.g. physical book and media borrowing).
                Through the validation process, OverDrive will store your address for the purpose of providing your name, address,
                and mobile phone number to your library, where you may be eligible for a library card for access to additional library resources.
                Your use of GLC confirms your consent to OverDrive providing your name, address, and mobile phone number with your library,
                and confirms your consent to be contacted by your library, if necessary.</p>
            <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding GLC, please contact OverDrive via email at <a href="mailto:privacy@overdrive.com">privacy@overdrive.com</a>.</p>
