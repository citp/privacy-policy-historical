# Congoo - Privacy Policy

|   |  **Congoo Privacy Policy**

Congoo is committed to protecting your privacy. Please read the Congoo Privacy Statement below and also any supplementary information at the end of this statement for additional details about particular Congoo sites and services that you may use.

This Congoo Privacy Statement applies to data collected by Congoo through its sites and services; it does not apply to data collected through other online or offline sites, products or services.

**Collection of your Personal Information**

In order to sign in to some of Congoo’s services, you will be asked to enter an e-mail address and password, which we refer to as your Congoo credentials. Some services may require added security, and in these cases, you may be asked to create an additional security key. Finally, a unique ID number will be assigned to your Congoo credentials which will be used to identify your credentials and associated information. You may also use any other Congoo credentials to sign into most Congoo services.

When registering on Congoo, Congoo collects personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address and telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, occupation, interests and favorites. Information collected on Congoo may be combined with information obtained from other Congoo services and other companies.

We may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with Congoo sites and services. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses.

Some Congoo services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both Congoo and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.

**Use of your Personal Information**

Congoo collects and uses your personal information to operate Congoo and deliver services and information you have requested. These services may include the display of customized content and advertising based upon the information we have collected. In order to provide services in conjunction with other Congoo products or services, personal information collected on Congoo may be accessed and used by other Congoo services as necessary to provide such services. Any use of such information within Congoo will remain subject to the limitations of this privacy statement.

We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. Some Congoo services may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the service. We may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from Congoo and its affiliates.

We may also automatically share your personal information with third party content providers when you access premium sections within their site from links on Congoo. Congoo does not sell, rent or lease its Congoo customer lists to third parties. We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your personal information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. You will be given the option of unsubscribing from communications sent to you by Congoo at any time by following the instructions at the bottom of the emails sent to you. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Congoo may access and/or disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Congoo or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Congoo, including its Congoo family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Congoo services or members of the public.

Personal information collected on this site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Congoo or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. The protection and handling of your personal information may be subject to the laws and regulations within the countries that your information is hosted in or transferred through.  Congoo abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.

**Registration Data**

Congoo collects and stores your registration and other personal information to operate and deliver the services and information that you request. Additionally, certain sites and services on the Congoo Content Network require your registration information in order to provide you with their services. Congoo can automatically share a copy of this registration information also known as your Congoo credentials to third party content providers who require that information in order to provide free access to content or services. Anytime the transmission of your registration data is required by a publisher to obtain free access, Congoo will ask whether you would like this information transfer to take place. Congoo will make the privacy policies of all third parties available to review so that you can review them before you decide to transfer your registration information. It is only by clicking “yes” that Congoo will transfer your registration information. Congoo does not participate and is not responsible for the marketing practices of any organization that you decide to pass your registration information. We strongly recommend that you read the privacy policies of any organization before deciding to share your registration information. Your Congoo password is not shared with any of these third parties.

In accordance with the preceding paragraph please note that if you elect to transfer your personal registration data through Congoo, the sites and services where your information is transferred may use or share your e-mail address or other personal information as described in their privacy polices.  All sites or services on the Congoo Content Network are required to have a posted privacy statement, but we do not control or monitor the privacy practices of sites on the Congoo Content Network, and the privacy practices of those sites will vary. You should carefully review the privacy statement for each site you visit in order to determine how each site or service will use the information it collects. Some services offered on Congoo may collect personal information. In such cases, you may be able to access that information through alternative means of access described by the service.

**Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information**

When we collect age information and users identify themselves as under 13, we will obtain consent from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information on Congoo as described in this Privacy Statement. If we change this Congoo Privacy Statement in a way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of children's personal information to which a parent has previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will be required to obtain the parent's additional consent. Parents can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit or request the deletion of their children's personal information, by visiting Account Services, and clicking on "Permission for kids."

Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use Congoo services, this will include such general audience communication services as the Congoo Toolbar. We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online.

We will delete your sign-in credentials if they remain inactive for an extended period of time. Inactivity is defined as a failure to sign in to any site or service on the Congoo Content Network using your credentials.

**Congoo Toolbar**

Each time you use Congoo Search, including the Congoo Toolbar, cookies may be placed on your machine and Congoo may collect your Internet IP address, the time and date of your search terms, and your browser configuration. Congoo may use this information to customize your search results.

While you have Congoo’s Net Pass & toolbar installed and running in your browser, please note that new versions of the Congoo Toolbar will automatically be installed on your computer. This keeps the software up-to-date and lets you take advantage of the newest features as soon as they are available.

The Congoo Toolbar also includes a feature which can automatically fill out forms on Web sites with information such as your address, passwords, and credit card information so that you do not have to repeatedly type the same information or remember multiple passwords. The Toolbar will prompt you to create a single “form fill password.” You must enter the form fill password every time you wish to automatically enter a stored credit card number and the first time each browser session you wish to automatically enter a stored password.

**Security of your Personal Information**

Congoo is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

**Use of Cookies**

Congoo does use "cookies" to enable users to sign in to Congoo services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.

Congoo uses cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your personalized content and appropriate advertising on your later visits to Congoo.

When you sign in to a site using your Congoo credentials, the Congoo Network stores your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. The Congoo Network also uses cookies to improve the sign in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Congoo sites and services that depend on cookies.

**Use of Web Beacons**

Congoo Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow Congoo to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Congoo may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or Congoo Newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.

Congoo may also place Web beacons from third parties on our site in order to compile aggregated statistics and to help determine the effectiveness of our joint promotional or advertising campaigns. Congoo prohibits Web beacons on our site from being used by third parties to access your personal information.

Finally, Congoo may work with other companies that advertise on Congoo to place Web beacons on their sites in order to allow us to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on Congoo results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser’s site.

**Use of Third Party Ad Networks**

Congoo allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on Congoo Web pages. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Congoo does not have access to the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks. Those ad networks that use persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting. You may find more information at the Web site of either the individual ad network or the Network Advertising Initiative.

**Controlling "Spam" or Unsolicited E-mail**

Congoo is concerned about controlling unsolicited commercial e-mail, or "spam." Congoo has a strict policy prohibiting the use of all Congoo mail accounts to send spam.

**Changes to this Statement**

We will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect changes in our services and customer feedback. If there are material changes to this Statement or in how Congoo will use your personal information, we will prominently post such changes prior to implementing the change. We encourage you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Congoo is protecting your information. 

**Contact Information**

Congoo welcomes your comments regarding this Privacy Statement. If you have questions about this Statement or believe that we have not adhered to it, please contact Congoo Privacy.
