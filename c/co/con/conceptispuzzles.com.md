##  General

Conceptispuzzles.com is an online logic puzzles community with more than 200,000 registered members and many new ones joining every day. While some people come just for the puzzles, many others seek for a more advanced and social interactive experience. To do so, this website allows you sharing some personal information and preferences with other members.

We never have and never will share, provide, disclose or sell any of our members' personal information to any third party or individual. We get tons of spam and hate it just like you! All personal information will be used strictly for internal demographic analysis, and will be handled by Conceptis' management team only.

##  Traffic statistics

When serving millions of Internet pages every month webmasters must have some way of tracking basic traffic trends. Collecting information about where browsers are coming from, which pages they visit most and what Flash versions are used are essential to improve any website code and content. Thus, at conceptispuzzles.com we use traffic monitoring tools such as [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) and [whos.amung.us](http://whos.amung.us/) to measure statistical traffic patterns on the website. These services provide us with purely anonymous statistical data which is not able to, and will not be used to track or collect personally identifiable information about our members.
