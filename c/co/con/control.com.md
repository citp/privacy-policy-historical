You do not have to register as a Control.com member to use the site. However, if you do, you will be asked to supply information such as your name, address and email, which may be used for the following purposes: 

  1. As a member, you may "subscribe" to discussion threads, which means we will send a copy of any subsequent posts to that thread via the email address you provided. This is optional, and you have the ability to remove any such subscription by visiting your Member page on the site.
  2. You may also "subscribe" to an entire topic or topics, or to a complete feed of messages posted to the site. Similarly, you may remove any such subscription on your Member page.
  3. Certain information you provide when registering may appear on the profile page that others may view on the site, but only if you specifically mark those items as public when you register. You may change this permission at any time on your member profile editing page.
  4. If you request a premium (e.g., a Control.com pocket protector), we will use the information you provided to mail the item to you.
  5. We will also use the email address you provided to contact you in the event that we have questions about a message you posted, or if your membership is nearing expiration.
  6. We may also disclose information you provide to us if required by law, or if you authorize such disclosure, or in special cases where we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our terms of service or causing injury to, or interference with, Control.com and/or its visitors, users and suppliers.
