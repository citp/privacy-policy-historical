  * You disclosed your contact details to one of our employees (for example you provided us with your business card or connected with us via social media).


  * We have modified our email footers.
  * Under CASL, all CEM must include certain prescribed content. For example, we must clearly identify ourselves as the party sending the CEM and provide a method whereby you can readily contact us.


  * We have incorporated "unsubscribe" mechanisms (explained below).
  * Some messages are specifically exempt from consent requirements. The following messages are exempt:


  * You have a personal relationship with one of our employees with whom you have previously had a direct, voluntary, two-way communication;
  * You have a family relationship with one of our employees who contacted you;
  * The CEM is sent to one of our affiliated companies;
  * The CEM was sent in response to your request or inquiry; or
  * The CEM was sent in order to enforce a legal right or obligation (for example, if you have an outstanding debt, or breached a contract that you have with us).
