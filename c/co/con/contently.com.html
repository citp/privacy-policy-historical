Please read the Terms of Service in their entirety, and refer to those for definitions and contacts.</p>
<h3>(a)&nbsp;<strong>Data Collected</strong></h3>
<p>We collect anonymous data from every visitor of the Website to monitor traffic and fix bugs. For example, we collect information like web requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the Internet Protocol address, the browser type, the browser language, and a timestamp for the request.</p>
<p>We ask you to log in and provide certain personal information (such as your name and email address) in order to be able to save your profile and the documents and comments associated with it. In order to enable these or any other login based features, we use cookies to store session information for your convenience. You can block or delete cookies and still be able to use Contently, although if you do you will then be asked for your username and password every time you log in to the <a href="http://www.contently.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Website</a>.

<h3>(b)&nbsp;<strong>Use of the Data</strong></h3>
<p>We only use your personal information to provide you the Contently services or to communicate with you about the services or the Website.</p>
<p>With respect to any documents you may choose to upload to Contently, we take the privacy and confidentiality of such documents seriously. We encrypt all documents, and permanently delete any redacted edits you make to documents. If you choose to make a document public, we recommend you redact any and all references to people and addresses, as we can’t protect public data and we are not responsible for any violation of privacy law you may be liable for.</p>
<p>We employ industry standard techniques to protect against unauthorized access of data about you that we store, including personal information.</p>
<p><strong>We do not share personal information you have provided to us without your consent, unless:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">– doing so is appropriate to carry out your own request;<br>
– we believe it’s needed to enforce our Terms of Service, or that is legally required;<br>
– we believe it’s needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues;<br>
– otherwise protect our property, legal rights, or that of others.</p>

<p>Contently may contact you, by email or other means. For example, Contently may send you promotional emails relating to Contently or other third parties Contently feels you would be interested in, or communicate with you about your use of the Contently website. Contently may also use technology to alert us via a confirmation email when you open an email from us. You can modify your email notification preferences by clicking the appropriate link included in the footer of email notifications. If you do not want to receive email from Contently, please opt out of receiving emails at the bottom of any Contently emails.</p>

Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.</p>
<p>We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
