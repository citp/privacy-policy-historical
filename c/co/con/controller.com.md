**WHY DO WE HAVE THIS POLICY?**

Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting your personal information from unauthorised use or disclosure. We will therefore use your personal information, and transfer it to others, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Our Privacy Policy applies whenever you visit the Websites, during the period you receive services from us, during the process of you ordering products from us and afterwards.

**1\. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND WHEN?**

Personal data means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). We only collect information that we will use for the purposes set out in this policy.

Specifically, we collect: 

  * **Information you submit to us** You can submit information to us in the following ways: 
    * Through forms, for example signing up to an offer, news or a competition;

    * By registering accounts on the Websites or any Sandhills' mobile phone applications, including setting up passwords and preferred user names, contact details, account details, your preferences and interests.   
(Please note: If you submit details to us of any other person (e.g. a friend), please make sure you have their permission before doing so.) 
  * **Information we collect about you**
    * Full details of the purchases you make on the Websites or on the telephone, including the time and date of purchase, the products you purchase from us, any relevant delivery address and details of any relevant payment card.

    * Information from banking, credit card and credit reference agencies about your financial status and the status of any payment card presented to us (for example, if it has been reported stolen) to check we are likely to be paid for any transaction and to reduce the risk of fraud.
    * Profile information and insight from companies who already have information on you, such as credit reference agencies (customer insight companies). They give us their views on what your household may look like, your status, likely preferences and behaviours.



We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data).

  * [Sandhills Group Companies](http://www.sandhills.com/sandhills-groups) and [Brands](http://www.sandhills.com/ourbrands) and [Services](http://www.sandhillssystems.com/) We do so because we hope to have a relationship with you across all these different brands and businesses, if not now, then in the future, and we want to be able to provide you with the same value and high quality of experience wherever you choose to interact with us.
  * Other people and businesses who help us provide the Websites, and related services to you, for example, information technology companies who design and host the Websites and payment services companies who enable you to use payment cards with us.

  * Other people who make a subject access request to us, where we are allowed to do so by law (see Managing Your Information below for what we mean by a subject access request).



We may also share the information we collect where we are legally obliged to do so, for example, to comply with a court order. 

**4\. SOCIAL MEDIA, BLOGS, REVIEWS, AND SIMILAR SERVICES**

Any posts or comments you make to us on social media will be shared under the terms of the relevant social media platform (for example, Facebook or Twitter) on which they are made and could be made public by that platform. These platforms are controlled by other people, not us, so we are not responsible for this sharing. You should review the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the social media platforms you use to ensure you understand how they will use your information, what information relating to you they will place in the public domain and how you can stop them from doing so if you are unhappy about it.

Any blog, review or other posts or comments you make about us, our products and services on any of our blog, review or user community services will be shared with all other members of that service and the public at large.

You should ensure that any comments you make on these services, and on social media in general, are fit to be read by the public, and in particular are not offensive or defamatory. You are responsible for ensuring that any comments you make comply with any relevant policy on acceptable use of those services. 

**5\. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION**

Information provided through the Websites is stored on our secure servers or those of any third party we engage to provide our IT platform, and is encrypted using standard technology. 

Where we have given you, or you have chosen, a password which enables you to access your account or certain parts of the Websites, you are responsible for keeping the password confidential and must not share it with anyone. You are responsible for any actions carried out using your password except where there has been fraud.

Although we are based in the US, we occasionally need to use international suppliers to help ensure you receive the very best products and services from us as well as coordinate with our international [Sandhills Group Companies](http://www.sandhills.com/sandhills-groups)

To allow us to run our business on this basis, the information we collect may be transferred to, stored and used at premises in countries outside the US. When it is necessary to transfer your personal data outside the US, we will ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect thte privacy and integrity of such personal data. Please Contact Us if you wish to obtain information concerning such safeguards.

**7\. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION FOR?**

In accordance with our legal data protection and privacy obligations, we will only retain your information for as long as we need it to achieve the purpose(s) for which we obtained it in the first place, as required by law, and for the exercise or defence of legal claims. We will then either securely delete it or anonymise it so that it cannot be linked back to you (see paragraph 2 for full details of those purposes). 

**8\. MANAGING YOUR INFORMATION**

It is very important to us that all the information we hold about you remains accurate and up to date to reduce the risk of a misunderstanding. We need your help in doing so. If you have an online account with us, please ensure that the information (for example, contact information) you provide to us through that account remains accurate and up to date. Please review and update it regularly.

You have several rights in relation to your personal data under applicable privacy and data protection law, which may be subject to certain limitations and restrictions. Depending on your country of residence or domicile, you may have other legal rights over the information we collect from you and your devices. We will honour all such legal rights. To see other available privacy policies for other countries, please see [Jurisdictions](http://www.sandhills.com/jurisdictions).

We may request proof of identification to verify your request. We reserve the right to charge you a small administration fee to meet our costs in honouring your legal rights, where permitted by the relevant law. We reserve the right not to comply with any requests we receive where we may lawfully do so, for example if we reasonably believe a request to be malicious, technically very onerous, to involve disproportionate effort or harmful to the rights of others.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/info/contact-us). We will respond to any valid requests within the time periods required by applicable privacy and data protection law.

If you have any questions or complaints about our use of your information, please [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/info/contact-us). We will do our very best to answer any question and resolve any complaint to your satisfaction.
