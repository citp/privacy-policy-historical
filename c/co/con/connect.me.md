### APPLICATION

This Privacy Policy relates to your personal data (i.e., data about you, an individual, from which you can be identified). This Privacy Policy therefore does not apply to any data insofar as it is held, processed, disclosed or published in a form which cannot be linked to a living individual (such as anonymized data or aggregated data, which, in a given form, cannot directly or indirectly be used to identify you as an individual) ("Anonymized and Aggregated Data").

### RESPONSIBILITY FOR DATA PROCESSING

In the course of providing our technology services to our enterprise clients (“clients”), including data hosting, back-up and data processing services in connection with our digital wallets and identity verification technology, We process personal data records of individuals who are our clients’ customers or otherwise associated with our clients. In those circumstances, We act as processors of data on behalf of our client and on our client’s instructions and the client is ultimately responsible for the processing of your personal data. If you are a customer of one of our clients and believe that We process your data on behalf of one of our clients, please refer to the client’s privacy policy for information regarding the processing of your data. 

Evernym collects and processes personal data on its own behalf where the data is collected in connection with the administration of Our business and the promotion and marketing of our technology services, including in the operation of our Digital Channels. We may also collect personal data from end-users of our technologies if We market and offer our technologies directly to end-users. In those circumstances, Evernym is the entity which is responsible for the processing of personal data. If you have any questions or concerns about Evernym’s use of your personal data, please contact us at info@evernym.com. 

### COUNTRIES OF PROCESSING

We operate data hosting services for our clients primarily from the United States of America (USA) and our data collection and processing activities take place predominantly in the USA. However, We also operate data centers in other jurisdictions through local subsidiaries or affiliates including in the European Union. We store and otherwise process data (including personal data) through third-party cloud service providers and other IT service providers which may be located or operate in other countries, including countries which do not guarantee the same level of protection to privacy as the USA. 

When transferring personal data records from the EU to a country outside the EU which does not provide an adequate level of protection to privacy rights, we put in place appropriate safeguards including data transfer agreements on the terms approved by the EU Commission. Where appropriate, We may also rely on your consent for the transfer of your personal data for processing outside the EU.] 

### HOW WE COLLECT AND USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

Your digital credentials. Our digital identity technology and digital wallets are designed to provide a secure method for consumers to access and exchange identity-related information (“digital credentials”) when dealing with various organisations including when they use financial and other services and when purchasing goods and services. These digital credentials are stored on the end-user’s device. Where the end-user chooses to upload his or her data to the cloud (for example for back-up purposes), We may host the data on our servers or through third-party cloud service providers. We may also hold encryption keys relating to your encrypted data. Where We provide the data hosting service, users’ data is held on our servers in an encrypted form that does not enable the identification of specific individuals, even by Evernym itself. 

Data that we receive from our clients. When providing data hosting services for our clients, We receive encoded data from our clients relating to their customers. That data enables our clients to identify its customers when using our services. 

Information That You Provide Directly or Authorize Someone Else to Give Us. We may ask you to provide certain information including, but not limited to your name, email address, and any other information You choose to provide to Us. For example, We may collect information from You when You register for and/or use our Digital Channels, contact or interact with Us, fill out a form, apply for employment, respond to a survey, and voluntarily provide Us with Your comments and/or questions and other content in connection with using our Digital Channels.

### EU PRIVACY RIGHTS

Users based in the European Union have the following legal rights in respect of their information:

(a) The right to require the data controller to confirm whether or not their information is being processed, the purpose of any such processing, the recipients of any information that has been disclosed, the period for which their information is to be stored and whether any automated decision-making processes are used in relation to their information;

(b) The right to require the data controller to rectify inaccurate information without undue delay;

(c) Where the data controller has relied on the ‘consent’ basis for processing that information (see paragraph 9(b) above), the right to withdraw their consent at any time. This right to withdraw consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;

(d) The right to request the erasure of their information in certain circumstances. You can make a request for erasure where:

(i) the information is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected;

(ii) where the processing of the information is based on the user’s consent (and the other circumstances described in the ‘Legal Basis for Processing Your information’ and ‘How We May Share Your information’ sections above no longer apply), if the user withdraws his or her consent; or

(iii) where the personal data is processed by the data controller solely on the basis of our ‘legitimate interest’ referred to in paragraph 9(a) (and the other legal basis set out in paragraph do not apply), if the user objects to the processing of his or her personal data and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing (such as, for example, where the processing of the data is required to meet statutory obligations or for the defence of legal claims). 

Where the data controller has disclosed the information of a European Union user to a third-party and the user requests the erasure or rectification of the data, the data controller should take all reasonable steps to inform the third-party of such request;

(e) The right to require the data controller to restrict its processing of a user’s personal data in certain circumstances, such as where the accuracy of that data is disputed or an objection has been raised. In such circumstances, the data controller should only process that information with the express consent of the user, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest;

(f) Where data is processed based on user’s consent or to fulfil a contractual obligation, the user has the right to receive his or her personal data from the data controller in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format;

(g) The right to object to the processing of personal data where:

(i) the data controller relies solely on the ‘legitimate interest’ basis for processing that data, in which case we will be legally required to stop processing the user’s information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the user’s privacy rights and interests; or

(ii) the information is used for direct marketing purposes, in which case we will immediately stop processing the user’s information for such purposes;

(h) Users have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection supervisory authority of the EU member state where the user resides.

The above legal rights are subject to various conditions and exceptions including where the data is used for statistical or scientific research purposes and the exercise of the right would prevent such purposes from being attained or would seriously impair their attainment.

If you access any website, application, or resources provided by a third-party, our Privacy Policy will not apply. Your interactions with such websites, applications, and resources are subject to the privacy policies of the third parties that operate them.
