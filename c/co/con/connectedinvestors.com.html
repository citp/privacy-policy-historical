<p><b>PRIVACY
POLICY</b></p>

<p><b>Scope
</b></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy
describes the types of personal information we collect through our websites and
our mobile application.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy
supplements, but does not supersede our Terms of Service Agreement. All
capitalized terms in this Privacy Policy that are not otherwise defined have
the meanings given to them in the Terms of Service Agreement.</p>

<p>By using the
Services, you agree to our collection and use of private information in
accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this
Privacy Policy, you should not use the Site or our App, even for browsing.</p>

<p><b>Personal
Information We Collect</b></p>

<p><i>Information
You Give Us </i></p>

<p>You do not have to
give us any personal information to browse the Services. However, you may be
asked to provide personal information to submit or request information from us,
or to use the Services. Once you provide us with personal information about
you, you are no longer anonymous to us. This information may include:</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span><i>Registration Information</i>. When you sign up for the Services,
you are required to provide information such as your name, email address,
password and location(s) of interest. </p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span><i>Profile Information</i>. You may choose to provide us with
profile information, such as your picture, personal bio, interests, posts and
other comments, phone number, physical address, alternate email address, and
links to other websites. By default, this information will be made public to
users of the Services. Please see VI.C for information about how to manage the
information you share through the Services. &nbsp;</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span><i>Additional Information</i>. Additional information that you
provide to us, including when you complete certain forms through the Services,
upload or submit any material through the Services, request information or
contact us with inquiries, or when you use other certain aspects of our
Services, may be collected and stored. For example, you may be asked to provide
a credit card number to subscribe to Services. You may also be asked to provide
financial information or bank account numbers, your date of birth and the last
4 digits of your Social Security number to verify your identity and “User
Level” as described below. </p>

<b>

<p></p>

<p><i>Location
Information</i></p>

<p>We use location
information from location-enabled devices (including through GPS, cellular, and
Wi-Fi networks) and from third parties to determine your location and as a
means to provide you with the most relevant data and search information for the
Services. We collect location information from your mobile device even when you
are not actively using the App (such as when the App is running in the
background or if you exit the App without using “force quit”). You can disable
location services through your mobile device’s settings or the App’s settings
by turning off the location information. But quitting and reopening the App
may automatically reset the settings to allow the transmission of location
information, even if you do not manually adjust the settings. </p>

<p><i>Automated
Information Collection </i></p>

<p>We may collect
certain information about your use of the Services through the use of tracking
technologies or by other passive means. This “passively collected” information
includes, but is not limited to, the domain name of the website that allowed
you to navigate to the Services, search engines used, the internet protocol
(IP) address used, the length of time spent on the Services, the pages you
looked at on the Services, other websites you visited before and after visiting
the Services, the type of internet browser you have, the frequency of your

following:&nbsp; </p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span><i>Log Information</i>. When you access the Services, our

operating system, email patterns, your mobile device and mobile operating
system, the name of your internet service provider or your mobile carrier, the
date and time of your request, and one or more cookies (small text files
containing a string of characters) that may uniquely identify your browser. </p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span><i>Links</i>. The Services may include links in a format that enables us
to keep track of whether these links have been followed by IP addresses. We use
this information to improve the quality of our products and design.</p>

receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are
going when you leave the Services. Additionally, advertisers receive the URL of

that if you disable cookies, you may not be able to use some customized
features available through the Services. </p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span><i>Web Beacons</i>. Web beacons (also known as “pixel
tags” or “clear GIFs”) are 1x1 single-pixel graphics that allow us to count the
number of users who have visited or accessed the Services and to recognize

Services administration and navigation, to track the actions of users of the
Services, to compile aggregate statistics about Services usage and response
rates, and to provide an enhanced online experience for visitors to the
Services. We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail messages
that we send to determine which e-mail messages were opened. </p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span><i>Aggregate Information</i>. We may compile certain personal
information and other information collected through the Services on an
aggregate basis. This information may include, without limitation, the number

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span><i>Google Analytics</i>. We may use Google Analytics to gather

improve web services. According to Google, Google Analytics employs cookies to
define user sessions, which allows for the collection of important data about

Services by changing your User Level. To change your User Level, contact <a href="mailto:support@connectedinvestors.com">support@connectedinvestors.com</a></p>
