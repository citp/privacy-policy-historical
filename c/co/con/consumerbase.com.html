          <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
          <p>ConsumerBase has a deep commitment to the privacy of every individual
            about whom it holds information. Since we gather individual consumer

            <br>
            <strong>Compliance</strong><br>
            ConsumerBase actively monitors all local laws in

            <br>

            ConsumerBase captures consumer information from our partners and
              our internal affiliates. This information is typically obtained
              through our partners' sites in connection with a user's registration
              on a particular site. The information captured allows for more
            targeted offers to consumers.</p>
          <p><a href="#privacymenu">Return to Privacy Menu</a></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>          <p><strong><a name="useofinfo"></a>Use of Information</strong><br>
            ConsumerBase uses any information given by users of our partners’ and
            affiliate’s web sites in order to provide these users with
            information on products and/or services that may be of interest to
            them.<br>
            <br>
            We may enhance or merge users’ personally identifiable information
            with data collected from other sources to use in direct or online
            marketing, including the data services described in "Sharing
            of Information" below. In the event we enhance or merge personally
            identifiable information with data collected from other sources,
            we will take all necessary steps to maintain the integrity and quality
            of that information.</p>
          <p><a href="#privacymenu">Return to Privacy Menu</a></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>          <p><strong><a name="sharinginfo"></a>Sharing of Information</strong><br>
            ConsumerBase uses the information described above to help our clients
              better understand the demographics of their target audiences as
              well as to support our marketing data products and services. We
              may provide personally identifiable data to marketing companies,
              advertising agencies, data compilers, data companies, and, to the
              extent permitted by law, individual reference and look-up service
              programs. Such information may be used by such companies to provide
              consumers with information on products and services that may be
              of interest.<br>
              <br>
            If consumers in our database have indicated that they do not want
            to have their data shared with third parties, ConsumerBase will limit
            the use of their data to the suppression, validation and enhancement
            of existing information held by third parties about its users. For
            example, marketers may use data about a registrant provided by ConsumerBase,
            such as "opt-out" information, to suppress or drop the
            registered user's name from a file of potential customers. Additional
            information may be used to verify and/or validate the accuracy of
            existing data on the registrant that was lawfully acquired by a marketer.
            In addition, our data customers may use data supplied by ConsumerBase
            to enhance or append personally identifiable data to their file for
            use in direct or online marketing subject to the terms of their own
            privacy policies.<br>
            <br>
            Exceptions may occur in the event of a merger, acquisition, sale
            of assets of ConsumerBase or any of its divisions as a going-concern,
            or change of control, in which case such data would be considered
            a business asset and would be transferred subject to the terms of
            this privacy policy. Nonetheless, our users will always have the
            opportunity to choose whether or not they want to receive further
            information and offers from any division within ConsumerBase or our
            marketing partners.</p>
          <p><a href="#privacymenu">Return to Privacy Menu</a></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>          <p><strong><a name="optout"></a>Opt-out/Unsubscribe Policy</strong><br>
            By registering with our partners or our affiliate site and to receive
              third party offers, users allow ConsumerBase and its affiliates
              to make their personally identifiable information available to
              third parties in accordance with the terms of this privacy policy.
              ConsumerBase provides users the option to opt-out from receiving
              information sent on behalf of third party advertisers by our internal
              affiliates or to opt-out from ConsumerBase and its divisions sharing
              information with advertisers or third party marketers for promotional
              purposes. Notwithstanding, all personally identifiable information
              provided by a user may be used by ConsumerBase to support its marketing
              data services business described above.<br>
              <br>
            Users may unsubscribe to electronic mailings sent via our internal
            affiliates at any time by following the instructions contained at
            the end of every newsletter or emailing. Users may opt-out of receiving
            further information sent on behalf of third party advertisers by
            our CustomOffers affiliate or from ConsumerBase sharing information
            with advertisers or third party marketers for promotional purposes.
            Currently, ConsumerBase does not offer users a means by which to
            completely delete personal data in order to maintain a master suppression
            file.<br>
            <br>
            Please note that information sent on behalf of third party advertisers
            is prepared days in advance, so users may continue to receive email
            from our CustomOffers affiliate for up to 72 hours after they have
            un-subscribed.</p>
