You may give us personal data about you, when you enquire about our activities, fill in forms on our site [www.concern.net](https://www.concern.net/) (our site) or correspond with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise provide us with personal data.

This includes, but is not limited to, information you provide when you share information via websites which we manage.

### Personal data we may otherwise collect about you

With regard to each of your visits to our sites, we may automatically collect the following information:

We are also working closely with third parties (including, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, data analytics service providers, search information providers) and may receive information about you from them. All such processing will be done in compliance with GDPR.

We may receive information from a service provider contracted by us to carry out re-marketing which involves displaying our advertisements on other sites. In that context, we may receive information in relation to your browsing of those advertisements on those other sites.

Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a positive and relevant experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site and its functionality. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them see our [Cookie policy](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy).

## Our use of your personal data

We will use your personal data for a number of operational purposes, including, but not limited to:

  * Carrying out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us and to provide you with the information and services that you request from us

Depending on the process we are conducting on your personal data, Concern shall rely on specific legal bases for such processing. For example, we may rely on your consent, on contractual obligations, fulfilling certain legal obligations we may have or in our legitimate commercial interests which will not infringe your rights and freedoms. Where processing is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent. Concern will retain your data for specified periods of time depending on the nature and type of processing. Once these retention periods have expired, Concern undertakes to anonymise, destroy or delete your personal data.

Concern does not carry out automatic decision-making but we systematically analyse our databases and the information that we hold about you, in order to improve the efficiency, cost effectiveness and relevance of our communication with you (profiling), you will be informed about this as soon as possible, but at the latest when we contact you as a result of such profiling by reference to this privacy statement.

We may sometimes use geo-demographic and/or other personal information which may include identification of individuals’ capacity to give, through a process called ‘wealth screening’, using publically available information sources. We may also carry out our own research into our supporters, again using publically available information or information that you provide us with. This allows us to tailor our fundraising and marketing activities to make them as appropriate as possible for our supporters and reflect their interests as closely as possible.

If you would prefer us not to process your personal data for the purpose of wealth screening, we will respect your wishes.

If you do not wish to be subject to such profiling or wealth screening or wish to update your contact preferences, please call our donor support team on 01 417 7777, who will happily address your request or email [pref[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#86f6f4e3e0e3f4e3e8e5e3f5c6e5e9e8e5e3f4e8a8e8e3f2).

## Where we store your personal data

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").

Unfortunately, subject to the previous paragraphs, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
