## **Your personal data and how we protect them**

**What is personal data?**  
Personal data is information that can be assigned to your person. This includes, for example, your name, your address, your telephone number and your e-mail address.

**How does CONRAD protect your personal data?**  
At conrad.com and in the mobile applications, your personal data is encrypted during the ordering process and within your customer account using SSL (Secure Socket Layer, key exchange: RSA 1024 bit, encryption of user data: Triple-DES 1024 Bit) over the Internet. Within the mobile applications, the contents of the order process are analyzed by so-called parsing and displayed in the application. Credit card data is collected, processed and stored in encrypted form exclusively by our payment service provider Ingenico Payment Services. You can recognize a secure connection by the fact that the address displayed in the browser starts with "https://..." instead of "http://..." and a padlock appears at the bottom right-hand edge of the window. We protect our website and other systems by technical and organizational measures against loss, destruction, access, modification or distribution of your data by unauthorized persons.

**When and why do we use your data?**  
When does CONRAD use and process personal data? We know that the careful handling of your personal data is very important to you. Since CONRAD attaches great importance to data protection, we strictly adhere to the legal provisions of the Federal Data Protection Act and the Telemedia Act when collecting, processing and using data. In principle, you can use our website and our mobile applications without leaving any personal data behind. The personal data and information you provide us with is used by CONRAD to process orders, deliver goods and process payments. The delivery of the article ordered by you is carried out by a transport company commissioned by us. To this end, we will send your e-mail address to this carrier so that the carrier can provide you with information on the status of your shipments and a specific delivery date by e-mail. If you no longer wish to receive this service, you can object to the transmission of your e-mail address at any time. Your objection should be sent to sales@conrad.com. Furthermore we need your data to inform you about orders, products, services and offers of CONRAD. We only use e-mail advertising to the extent permitted by law or if you have specifically authorized us to do so. If you register for our newsletter, we use the data required for this or separately communicated by you in order to send you our e-mail newsletter on a regular basis. When using the Q&A service of our technical customer service, your personal data will be passed on and processed by the IT service provider Bazaarvoice. The company provides technical and administrative support from our technical specialists so that we can answer your questions as quickly as possible. The services around the topic product evaluations (reviews & ratings) are also supported by the company Bazaarvoice. The Bazaarvoices Privacy Policy can be found at <http://www.bazaarvoice.com/de/privacy-policy/>   
We collect, store and process your data for the entire processing of your purchase, including any subsequent guarantees, for our service, technical administration and our own marketing purposes. Your personal data will be deleted if there are no legal storage obligations to the contrary and if you have asserted a claim for deletion, if the data is no longer required to fulfil the purpose for which it was stored or if its storage is inadmissible for other legal reasons. If your account information is merged via an automatic or duplicate check initiated by you, you agree that information from the old account (payment experience, orders, etc.) is transferred to the new account. When using the Conrad customer card, the purchases made are transferred within the Conrad Group.

**Advantage offers of Sovendus GmbH:**  
For the selection of an advantage offer that is of regional interest to you, we will pseudonymise and encrypt the form of address, year of birth, country, postcode, hash value of the e-mail address and your IP address to Sovendus GmbH, Moltkestr. 11, 76133 Karlsruhe (Sovendus) (Art. 6 Para.1 f DSGVO). The pseudonymised hash value of the e-mail address is also used to take account of a possible objection to advertising by Sovendus (Art. 21 para. 3, Art. 6 para. 1 c DSGVO). The IP address is used by Sovendus exclusively for data security purposes and as a rule anonymised after seven days (Art. 6 Para.1 f DSGVO). When you click on a special offer, Sovendus will also receive your name, your address data and your e-mail address in encrypted form in preparation for the personalised request for the special offer from the product provider (Art. 6 Para.1 b, f DSGVO). For more information about Sovendus processing your data, please see our online privacy policy at [www.sovendus.de/datenschutz](https://www.conrad.com/ce/en/www.sovendus.de/datenschutz).

**What does CONRAD do with personal data?**  
Your personal data are stored in our EDP primarily for optimal order processing and customer care.  
Inventory data, such as previous purchase orders and payment experiences, are included in the selection of possible payment methods made available to you. If we make advance payments, e.g. in the case of a purchase on account, we may obtain credit information from Bürgel Wirtschaftsinformationen GmbH & Co. KG, Gasstr. 18, 22761 Hamburg, and/or Schufa Holding AG, Kormoranweg 5, 65201 Wiesbaden. For this purpose, we transmit the personal data required for a credit assessment to Bürgel Wirtschaftsinformationen GmbH & Co. KG, Gasstr. 18, 22761 Hamburg, and/or Schufa Holding AG, Kormoranweg 5, 65201 Wiesbaden, Germany, and use the information received about the statistical probability of non-payment for a considered decision on the establishment, implementation or termination of the contractual relationship.   
The credit information can contain probability values (score values), which are calculated on the basis of scientifically recognised mathematical-statistical procedures and in the calculation of which address data, among other things, are included. Your concerns worthy of protection will be taken into account in accordance with the statutory provisions.   
For the purpose of deciding on the establishment, execution or termination of the contractual relationship, we collect or use probability values that include transaction data and microgeographically aggregated information in their calculation.   
We save the contract text and send you the order data by e-mail. You can view the GTC at any time. You can view your past orders in our customer login area.

**Customer account**  
For each customer who registers accordingly, we set up password-protected direct access to his stored inventory data (customer account). Here you can view data about your completed, open and recently sent orders and manage your address data, bank details and the newsletter. You undertake to treat the personal access data confidentially and not to make them accessible to any unauthorised third parties. We cannot accept liability for misused passwords, unless we are responsible for the misuse. Once you have finished communicating with us, you should close the browser window or mobile applications, especially if you share your computer or mobile devices with others.

**Courses with Conrad**  
Personal data are only collected and processed in this context if you use the course offers and the personal data are required for processing your inquiry, your order or for creating anonymous statistical evaluations. All data not marked as mandatory are voluntary. By entering and sending the data you give us your consent to the automated processing or use of the data. In some cases it may be necessary for us to pass on some of your personal data to third parties, for example to cooperation partners or to the organiser of the event. Also in these cases your data will be used exclusively for the provision of our services and will be destroyed within the legal deadlines. Under no circumstances will your data be passed on, sold or used for commercial purposes to uninvolved third parties.

**How do we use cookies and similar technologies?**  
Does CONRAD use cookies?  
A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer when you surf the Conrad site. A cookie can only contain information that we ourselves send to your computer - private data cannot be read out with it. If you accept the cookies on our site, we do not have access to your personal information, but we can identify your computer using the cookies. Like many webshops, we use cookies to personalize the internet shop and the mobile applications for you and so that you can fill up and manage your shopping basket during your session with orders.   
Most of the cookies we use are deleted from your hard disk at the end of the browser session (so-called session cookies).   
Other cookies remain on your computer and enable us to recognize your computer on your next visit (so-called permanent cookies). These cookies make it unnecessary for you to re-enter your e-mail address for subsequent orders.   
If you do not want to take advantage of cookies, you can modify the cookie handling in the security settings of your browser. Usually the setting option can be found in the Tools menu under Settings or Internet Options. However, we will then no longer be able to offer you some of the functionalities of our Internet shop and mobile applications. To use our shopping cart, temporary cookies must be enabled.

**Third party cookies**  
Conrad uses advertising on other websites via advertising partners or advertising networks. These advertising partners use so-called third party cookies, which are activated by conrad.com after their visit, but can only be read out by the respective advertising partner. These third party cookies are used to measure the success of advertising measures used between the advertising partner and us. Our partner companies are not permitted to collect, process or use personal data via our website using cookies. Only the call of the conrad.com side and an advertising measure switched by the advertising partner is seized.

**Log files**  
Whenever CONRAD pages are accessed, usage data is transmitted through the respective Internet browser and stored in log files, the so-called server log files. The data records stored in this way contain the following data: Date and time of access, name of the page accessed, IP address, referrer URL (originating URL from which you accessed the website), the amount of data transferred, as well as product and version information of the browser used.

**Use of Google reCaptcha**  
To protect our online services we use so-called CAPTCHAs to decide whether the other party is a human being or a machine. This is done to determine whether entries were made via people or machines that are often misused. Because this query is retrieved from a Google server, Google will create a cookie for the duration of the query. For more information about Google Captcha's privacy policy, click here

**Google (Universal) Analytics**  
This website and mobile applications use Google (Universal) Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. "("Google"). Google (Universal) Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, if IP anonymisation is activated on this website, Google will reduce your IP address within Member States of the European Union or in other countries party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide the website operator with other services relating to website and Internet use. The IP address transmitted by your browser within the framework of Google (Universal) Analytics is not merged with other Google data. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) and from processing this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser add-on available under the following [Google Analytics deactivate]() link.   
Alternatively to the browser add-on or if you visit our pages via a mobile device, please click the following Google (Universal) Analytics opt-out link to prevent future collection by Google (Universal) Analytics within this website (the opt-out only works in the browser and only for this domain). An opt-out cookie is stored on your device. If you delete your cookies in this browser, you must click this . [Google Analytics deactivate]() link again.   
We use Google (Universal) Analytics including the functions of Universal Analytics. Universal Analytics allows us to analyze the activities on our pages across devices (e.g. for access via laptop and later via a tablet). This is made possible by the pseudonymous assignment of a user ID to a user. Such an assignment occurs, for example, when you register for a customer account or log into your customer account. For non-registered users we use an anonymous ID. However, no personal data will be forwarded to Google. Even if Universal Analytics adds additional functions to Google (Universal) Analytics, this does not mean that it restricts data protection measures such as IP masking or the browser add-on. We will only perform session additions on registered and unregistered sessions of users if our users have not withdrawn their consent to such session additions through the browser add-on or by clicking on the Google (Universal) Analytics opt-out link, or if such merging is permitted under applicable laws and regulations. 

Our website uses Optimize 360 (<https://www.google.com/analytics/optimize/>) to determine statistical parameters for the use of our offers. Anonymous measured values are collected. The tests use cookies to recognize computer systems whose runtime is limited to the duration of the test. IP addresses are not stored in the procedure. 

For reasons of transparency, we would like to point out that we use the Google Tag Manager. This manager does not collect any personal data. The Tag Manager makes it easier for us to integrate and manage our tags. Tags are small code elements used, among other things, to measure traffic and visitor behavior, to measure the impact of online advertising and social channels, to set up remarketing and targeting, and to test and optimize websites. For more information about the Google Tag Manager, see <https://www.google.com/intl/de/tagmanager/use-policy.html>. 

We also deliver our contributions as Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) via Analytics. It is therefore possible that after a Google search with your smartphone, for example, you may read our contributions on the Internet and they are not even on our servers. Instead, it may be that the pages are delivered directly from the cache of third-party providers such as Google. You can recognize this by the fact that the URL from which you accessed this page does not contain our domain name (i.e. our website) but e.g. the domain name of Google. Google will not change the source code of our site. 

If the AMP version of the site is stored in the cache of Google or other third parties and accessed from there, we have no influence on data processing and the handling of your IP address. We take care that we do not collect any personal data via our AMP pages. For this reason, the IP address - from our site - is transmitted exclusively anonymously.

**Hotjar**  
To improve usability and customer experience we use the Hotjar analysis service of Hotjar Ltd, a European company based in Malta (Hotjar Ltd, Level 2, St Julians Business Centre, 3, Elia Zammit Street, St Julians STJ 1000, Malta, Europe). This function enables the anonymous recording of mouse and scroll movements, mouse clicks and keyboard entries. Hotjar uses a tracking code to collect and transfer your data. When you visit a website that uses Hotjar, the tracking code automatically collects the data based on your activity and stores you on the Hotjar servers (in Ireland). In addition, the cookies placed on your computer or terminal by the website also collect data. Furthermore, Hotjar enables us to obtain anonymous user feedback. The possibility of session recording offered by Hotjar will not be used by us under any circumstances. Additional information on functions and data usage using Hotjar can be found at: [https://www.hotjar.com/privacy.](https://www.hotjar.com/privacy)

**FeedDynamics**  
In order to design and optimize this website and our marketing activities in line with requirements, anonymized data is collected and stored using solutions and technologies from econda GmbH and user profiles are created from this data using pseudonyms. For this purpose, cookies may be used that enable the recognition of an Internet browser. However, user profiles are not merged with data about the bearer of the pseudonym without the express consent of the visitor. In particular, IP addresses are made unrecognizable immediately after receipt, which makes it impossible to assign user profiles to IP addresses. The analysis of user behaviour is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the anonymised analysis of user behaviour in order to optimise both his website and his advertising activities. Visitors to this website can object to this data collection and storage at any time for the future here: <https://www.econda.de/widerruf-zur-datenspeicherung/>

The objection only applies to the device and the web browser on which it was set. Please repeat the process on all devices if necessary. If you delete the opt-out cookie, requests are sent to econda again.

This website may use technologies of emetriq GmbH, Vorsetzen 35, 20459 Hamburg, Germany, to collect and store anonymized data for marketing and optimization purposes. emetriq does everything to maintain the anonymity of the data made available, i.e. emetriq does not store any IP addresses or personal data. emetriq collects information about the surfing behavior of Internet users unknown to emetriq, e.g. which pages or products were viewed in the shops of our cooperation partners. emetriq assigns the stored information to an anonymous, multi-digit identification number which is stored in a cookie on the user's computer and which under no circumstances allows any inference to the user's person. In addition, the data is bundled to at least 30 users. This excludes individual assignment. Even by combining the stored information, emetriq is not able to identify a person.

**Social Plugins / Links to Social Media Operators**  
Our websites use social plugins from the following social networks (hereinafter referred to as "social networks"):   
Facebook (operated by: Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA) Google Plus (Operator: Google Inc., 16+00 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA)

**Enable social plugins**  
In the interest of the most comprehensive protection of your data, Conrad uses technical solutions that ensure that data transfer via social plugins to the respective operator of the social network does not take place without prior activation of the social plugins by you. 

Social plugins that are deactivated in their initial status are integrated on our websites and do not establish contact with Facebook servers or other operators of social networks without appropriate activation. If you activate these deactivated plug-ins by clicking on the "Activate Social Media" button at the end of a website, you thereby declare your consent to the transmission of the data described in Section 3.2 below to the social networks. After activation, the social plugins establish a connection to the respective social network. With a further click you can then send a recommendation within the respective social network. If you are already logged in to a social network while you are visiting our websites, no further login dialog may be displayed. 

Clicking on the "Activate Social Media" button therefore means that you give your consent for the data described in Section 3.2 below to be transmitted to the respective operator of the social network. 

However, this only applies to the website just opened and the specifically selected social media operator. The consent is valid for one session and must be renewed each time you leave our website after each subsequent visit. 

The consent can be cancelled at any time by clicking on the "Deactivate Social Media" button. 

In addition to the social plugins, our websites also contain simple links to Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest, del.icio.us, Mister Wong, LinkedIn, MySpace. 

Data exchange with the social media operators mentioned only takes place when the corresponding icon button (e.g. the "f" of Facebook, the bird symbol of Twitter, the "+1" symbol of Google Plus) is clicked. If you click on such an icon button, a page of the corresponding social media operator opens in a popup window. There you can publish information about our products according to the regulations of the social media operator.

**Data transfer via social plugins**  
If you activate the social plugins that are deactivated by default (cf. Section 3.1), a connection is established with the social network servers. Each social plugin then transmits data to the respective social network. We have no influence on the amount of data that the respective social network collects with the help of the social plugin. As far as we know, social networks receive information about which of our websites you have visited currently and previously. With each activated social plugin, a cookie with a unique identifier is set each time the relevant website is called. This enables the social network to create a profile of your usage behavior. It cannot be ruled out that such a profile can be assigned to you even if you register with the social network for the first time at a later date. 

If you are already logged in to a social network when you visit our websites, the operator of this social network may be able to assign the visit to your personal account as soon as you activate the social plug-ins that are deactivated by default (see Section 3.1). When using social plugin functions (e.g. "I like" button, making a comment), the information is transmitted directly from your browser to the corresponding social network and stored there. The same applies when calling up a website of a social media operator by clicking on the corresponding icon button. 

If you are not a member of a social network, the social networks may still receive and store your IP address and information about the browser and operating system you are using after you activate the social plugins. For the scope and purpose of the collection, processing and use of the data by social networks and information on rights and privacy preferences, please refer to the privacy policy of the respective social network. 

If you are a member of a social network and wish to limit the collection of data through our websites and the merging of your user data with the data stored about you on the social network, you should log out of the social network before visiting our websites.
