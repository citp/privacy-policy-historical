**ContentDealer.com Privacy Policy**

  
At ContentDealer.com., we value the trust that our customers place in us. Because your privacy is important, we’ve outlined our practices below to demonstrate our firm commitment to safeguarding the information you provide to us: 

For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes your domain name, but not your e-mail address (unless you choose to provide it via a contact, quote or order form). Our web server only collects aggregate statistics on which pages you access or visit. These statistics are used to improve the content of our web pages or to diagnose problems with the server. We do not track or otherwise monitor the pages you visit.   
If you wish to contact us via e-mail, we’ll collect and use your email address to correspond with you and offer the information or assistance you have requested. We do not share, rent, sell or otherwise distribute your information to any third parties.   
When you order from us, we require your postal address or EMail address to deliver your files on CD-ROM or by EMail to you. From time to time, we may also contact you either via postal mail or phone, to determine your satisfaction with the services you have received, or to request referrals or testimonials. We may also submit an estimate, proposal and/or contract to you via postal mail for the services you have inquired about.   
If you do not want to receive e-mail, postal or telephone contact from us aside from providing you the information and/or assistance you have requested, please contact us and we will remove you from our contact list.   
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically and contact us if you wish to have your information removed or revised.   
Thank you for your interest in ContentDealer.com. We look forward to working with you!
