Periodically, we administer online surveys to gather information about your use of energy and related products and services, or to obtain your views on the usefulness of our Website.

### Other Information We May Collect, Use, and Disclose

Con Edison uses software to automatically collect information that does not directly identify you ("Other Information") primarily for statistical purposes. This information, such as the name of the domain or IP address from which you access the Internet, the date and time when you access our Website, and the information that you view while using our Services, is typically used to monitor and compile statistics for use in evaluating and/or modifying our services, to improve content, and to diagnose and correct technical problems.

Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Customer Information under applicable law, then we may use it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Customer Information.

Some of our Website pages may use "cookies"—small amounts of data that a Website can send to you and that is stored on your computer. Cookies allow our Website to provide you with customized information, or they may recall data so you don't have to retype it. We may use session ID cookies, which terminate when you close your Internet browser, or persistent cookies, a small text file stored on your computer's hard drive for an extended time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. You may also wish to refer to <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html>. However, if you do not accept these cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer and provide personalized content when you visit the applicable Services.

We may collect the physical location of the device you use to communicate with us by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals. We may use your device's physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content. We may also share your device's physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content. In some instances, you may allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device's location, but if you choose to deny such uses and/or sharing, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.

### Security

Con Edison has implemented policy guidelines and reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to help safeguard Customer Information from unauthorized access or improper use. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the "Contacting Us" section below.

Con Edison's energy delivery and customer service systems are part of the critical infrastructure of our nation, and we take our responsibility to protect our systems seriously. We work with our governmental and other partners to help protect our property and our nation. Any correspondence that you send to Con Edison in electronic form, including email or any forms that you complete and transmit through this website, may be monitored for suspected illegal activity.
