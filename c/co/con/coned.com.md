This information may include your name, account number, home or business address, email address, telephone number, energy use data (including but not limited to smart meter readings), location information, or other information that is specific to you as our customer or that you otherwise elect to share with us.

At the end of this Privacy Statement, we provide you with the opportunity to choose regarding our use and disclosure of your Customer Information to third-parties for marketing purposes. Customer Information includes your name, account number, home or business address, email address, and telephone number.

##  How We May Collect and Use Information 

We gather and use information to do business with you, including sending you bills, letting you know about products and services we offer, and addressing your questions or concerns.

We may use information from programs in which you voluntarily participate. Some of these programs have additional rules, which may contain additional conditions regarding how we may use and disclose your information. We recommend that you read any such rules carefully.

We may use your information for business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, fraud monitoring and prevention, developing new product offerings and services, enhancing, improving or modifying our product offerings and services, identifying trends in energy use, developing and promoting programs and initiatives to encourage more efficient energy use and to manage demand for electricity, determining the effectiveness of our programs and promotional campaigns, and operating and expanding our business activities.

We may use information as we believe to be necessary or appropriate, to: (a) comply with requirements or directives of our governing regulatory agencies including, among others, the New York State Public Service Commission, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; (b) respond to requests from government or judicial authorities; (c) enforce our terms and conditions of service and applicable tariffs; (d) protect our operations or those of our affiliates; (e) protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others; and (f) allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. We also may use your information to send or serve marketing communications, offers, and promotions that may be of interest, including on social media platforms.

We send occasional online surveys to gather information about your use of, and your opinion about, our programs and services, our energy related product offerings, and our websites and apps.

Also consistent with your choices, we may also share information with third-parties who provide energy-related products and services.

##  Other Information We May Collect, Use, and Disclose

We use software to automatically collect other information that does not directly identify you. This information, such as the name of the domain or IP address where you access the Internet, the date and time when you access any of our websites, and the information that you view while using our services, is typically used for statistical purposes to help us to evaluate and improve our product offerings, services, and websites and apps, diagnose and correct technical problems, and detect fraud or other illegal activity and protect our systems.

We may also aggregate information so that it does not identify you or any other customer or user (for example, we may aggregate information to calculate the percentage of our customers who have a particular telephone area code). Please note that we may use and disclose this other information or aggregated information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. 

Some of our website pages may use "cookies", i.e., small amounts of data that is stored on your computer or other device where you access the Internet to allow our websites to provide you with customized information, or to recall data so you don't have to retype it.

Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. You may also wish to refer to <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html>. However, if you do not accept these cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our services. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer and provide personalized content. 

Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and compile statistics about usage of the Services and response rates. 

We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other similar technologies to collect and analyze information about the use of the Services and report on activities and trends.

We may also share your device's physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content. In some instances, you may allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device's location, but if you choose to deny such uses and/or sharing, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.

## Our Advertising

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you when you access and use our websites and other websites, based on information relating to your use of our websites and other websites, on any of your devices.
