Con Edison Internet Privacy Statement

Thank you for visiting the Con Edison Web site and reviewing our privacy policy. Con Edison is committed to your privacy and security. 

Con Edison has created this privacy statement to help you understand how we collect and use information when you visit www.coned.com: 

How We Protect Your Privacy

Personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit ("customer information") is used solely for Con Edison's purposes. We do not sell or otherwise share customer lists, and will not disclose your customer information to third parties that may want to market products or services to you. We may, however, need to share specific information with third-party business partners or contractors when that information is required in order to answer your inquiry, to fulfill your request for a product or service, or to otherwise conduct our business with you, including the collection of payment from you. 

In addition, though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law or to comply with a judicial proceeding, a subpoena, a court order, or other legal process. 

Con Edison has implemented policy guidelines and security features to access specific customer-account information and to help safeguard customer-specific account information from unauthorized access or improper use. 

Information We Gather When You Use Our Site

Con Edison uses software to automatically collect non-personal information about your visit for statistical purposes. This information, such as the name of the domain from which you access the Internet, the date and time you access our Web site, and the information you view while visiting our Web site, is used to measure the use of our site, to improve its content, and to diagnose and correct technical problems. 

Con Edison gathers and uses customer information in order to inform you of products and services, for billing purposes, and to resolve problems.

We use this information to respond to your requests and to transact business with you. 

Some of our Web site pages may use "cookies" – small amounts of data that a Web site can send to you and that is stored on your computer.

We may use session ID cookies, which terminate when you close your Internet browser, or persistent cookies, a small text file stored on your computer's hard drive for an extended time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. 

Periodically, we administer online surveys to gather information about your use of energy and related products and services, or to obtain your views on the usefulness of our Web site. Participation in our online surveys is voluntary. If you choose to participate, the information you provide will be used to improve our site and the products and services we offer to you.
