ConvertKit has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles, including the Supplemental Principles (collectively, the “Privacy Shield Principles”).

**a. Accountability for Onward Transfer**

When ConvertKit uses Service Providers to process Personal Data received in reliance on Privacy Shield, we’re responsible if that Service Provider processes the information in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles (unless we can prove that we’re not responsible for the Service Provider’s action that violated the Privacy Shield Principles). 

In certain situations, we may need to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements, or otherwise comply with the law or a court order.

We only collect Personal Data that is relevant for providing the Services. We process Personal Data in a way that is compatible with providing the Services or as otherwise authorized by you. We take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. We adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles for as long as we retain Personal Data. 

**d. Access to Personal Data**

If you would like to review, correct, delete, or update personal data that you have previously disclosed to us, please email us at [legal@convertkit.com](mailto:legal@convertkit.com).

If you are a Subscriber of one of our Customers, please contact the Customer directly with your request to access or limit the use or disclosure of your Personal Data. If you contact us, we will refer you to that Customer and support them in responding to your access request if necessary.

A binding arbitration option may also be available to you in order to address unresolved complaints.
