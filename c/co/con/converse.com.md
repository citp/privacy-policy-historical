**PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

**SECURITY**  

We use a variety of technical and organizational security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. Despite our efforts, no website, mobile application, database, or system is completely secure of “hack proof”. You can help keep your data safe by taking reasonable steps to protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure or misuse. 

**RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**  

Your personal information will be retained for as long as is necessary to carry out the purposes set out in this policy (unless otherwise required by law). In general, this means that we will keep your personal information for as long as you keep your Converse account, but we may keep your order history longer to comply with legal obligations. To delete your account or account information, please contact Consumer Services or check your account settings. 

**MANAGING YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

If you submit photos or other User Generated Content for reviews, communities, or other features, please be aware that this data may be posted publicly. You can request removal of your posted User Generated Content on the Websites or Apps, but please note that removal may not encompass all possible locations, for example, back-ups or sharing by other users initiated prior to removal. 

If you have a request regarding your personal information that cannot be fulfilled from your account settings, please contact us at Consumer Services. 

**COOKIES AND PIXELS**

Converse collects information from your browser or device when you use our Websites and Apps, including data described as “technical data” or “data about your visit” in the first section of this policy. We use a variety of methods, such as cookies and pixel tags to collect this information. We use this information for Website and App functionality, performance analysis and improvement, enabling third party interoperability (like social media log-in and sharing), and advertising. 

Your browser can help you manage these trackers. In your browser, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies in your browser settings. If you turn off all cookies, certain parts or features of our Website or Apps may not work properly. There are also general resources for opting out of interest based advertising available on the websites of the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance.

Similarly, you can adjust your advertising preferences on your mobile device at the device level. For example, to adjust you ad preference in iOS, visit Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking. To adjust your ad preferences in Android, visit Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of interest-based ads. 

**SOCIAL PLATFORMS AND LINKS TO OTHER SITES**

Our Websites and Apps contain third party social media plug-ins. If you interact with these plug-ins, your activity on our Websites or Apps will also be made available to those social platforms. Converse does not control these platforms and is not responsible for the collection and use of personal information on them or their respective privacy policies. Therefore, we encourage you to read the privacy policies of these social platforms before interacting with their plug-ins on our Websites or Apps. 

Our Websites and Apps may also contain hyperlinks to websites that are not operated by us. These hyperlinks are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not imply any endorsement of the activities of such third-party websites or any association with their operators. We do not control these websites and are not responsible for how they collect, use, or share personal information. We encourage you to review any privacy policy posted on any website you visit before using the website or providing any personal information about yourself.
