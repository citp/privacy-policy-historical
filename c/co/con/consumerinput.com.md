## Data Collection Technology and Data Usage Privacy

Compete’s research panel consists of data collected directly through the Consumer Input panel, recruiting partnerships with trusted entities or technology integration with partner applications. Panelists who choose to or opt-in to participate in the research panel are made up of people like you who wish to participate in market research – consumers who want to express their opinions about the products and services they use or that matter to them. 

By agreeing to participate, panelists allow their online activities, behaviors and exposures -- including the content of specific web pages, online purchasing activities and other activities undertaken during secure sessions -- and third party application usage -- types and frequency of applications used -- to be collected by Compete. 

You must affirmatively agree to download or trigger the data collection by Compete. If you opt-in for data collection, we collect from your computer what is known as click stream data. Click stream data includes information such as your IP address, the URLs (generally the online address information seen at top of a webpage) of websites you have viewed (and any information the webpage you're viewing places in those URLs, sometimes to pass along to the next page you view), the date and time you viewed the web pages, the duration of each visit and the search terms you entered on any webpage that enables online search. 

Through a combination of a proprietary privacy rules engine (technical rules), encrypted data and secure transmission, we strive to protect the identity of our panelists, and removing personally identifiable and sensitive information before this data is stored. If any personal or sensitive information is inadvertently collected (because it passes through or is not caught by the filter or technical privacy rules) by the application, we make commercially reasonable efforts to purge our database of the inadvertently collected personal or sensitive information.

### Our Services

We provide market research in the form of consumer opinions about products and services and consumer online behaviors by collecting related information from our panel members. 

Typically, the collected information is shared with our clients in aggregate or grouped form so that no individually identifiable information is released. The only exception to this practice is stated below under Information Collection. We do not use panel information as part of a targeted marketing program. We respect and honor the privacy of our panelists.

### Information Collection – Direct or Via Partnerships

**Basic Demographic Information:** For some of our users, general demographic information may be collected during the Compete application download process, registration, or API call. This information is integral to our research and used to ensure that we have the right representations of people in our panel.

**Survey Response:** For some of our users, we may obtain your email address as part of the site registration process and application download. We may use your email address to directly contact you or we may work through our partners to contact panel members to ask about their attitudes and opinions about a variety of products, services, trends and events. The questions we ask are presented through surveys received by email or on a survey questionnaire website.

Typically, we combine panel members' survey responses and report on the aggregated (or grouped) results. On some occasions, individually identifiable information and responses may be disclosed to retail partners or clients so they can gain better insight into their existing and prospective customers. In such cases, we obligate partners and clients to commit that panel members are not directly targeted with marketing communications or offers for products and services based on the information we share.

When we occasionally ask for additional personally identifying information as part of a specific survey or project, we will provide an explanation in the text of the questionnaire to allow members to make an informed decision about whether they want to provide it or not. The explanation will include a description of any new identifying information that will be collected via the survey and with whom it will be shared. 

As with any survey, members can decline to take the survey or stop at any time during the survey process. Like all other information we collect, any additional information collected for a specific survey will be used for research purposes only.

**Online Activities:** As outlined above, we collect information about your online activities, including the content of the specific webpages you visit, your purchasing behavior and the applications you use. Using the small technology application you download when you agree to join the panel, we collect from your computer what is known as clickstream data. 

Clickstream data includes information such as your IP address, the URLs (generally the address information) of websites you have viewed (and any information the webpage you're viewing places in those URLs), the date and time you viewed the web pages, the duration of each visit and the search terms you entered on any webpage that enables online search. 

Through a combination of a proprietary privacy rules engine, encrypted data and secure transmission, we strive to protect our panelists. We make efforts to remove personally identifiable information before the collected data is stored in our systems. If any personal information is inadvertently collected by the application, we make commercial efforts to purge our database of that information promptly. 

We may also collect information about the cookies that are on your computer which could include cookies placed by third parties. We have no access or control of third party tracking technologies. 

If personally identifiable information is inadvertently collected by the software, we take commercially viable efforts to promptly purge our database of that inadvertently collected sensitive information.

**Computer Diagnostic Information:** We may collect general computer software, hardware, networked devices, and configuration information from the computer where you have installed our application. This information is typically used to address technical and performance related issues if they arise.

**Cookies, Beacons and Site Logging:** We use temporary session cookies during the download and registration process to correctly identify the research panel that the user has joined, enable the creation of a unique, anonymous identifier and to trigger the download process. 

We may use cookies for advertising research purposes. By using cookies, we are able to track of the types of online advertisements that you see on the websites that you visit, as well as the number of times that you see those ads.

In some cases, we may create an event that allows us to anonymously connect your activity from the data collection application with a Compete owned third party site cookie.

### Our Clients and Data Sharing Practices

Marketers from leading companies, agencies and publishers turn to Compete to improve their marketing effectiveness. Compete helps them by providing market research, media planning and media measurement tools to drive their marketing.

Compete uses data gathered from our panel to create a wide array of products for marketers. Compete also offers clients the ability to survey the panel to provide attitudinal data in addition to behavioral measures. With Compete’s products and services, companies can measure their effectiveness across all of their marketing programs.

Typically, we combine panel members' responses and report on the aggregated (or grouped) results. On some occasions, individually identifiable information and responses may be disclosed to retail partners or clients so they can gain better insight into their existing and prospective customers. In such cases, we make commercially reasonable efforts to filter sensitive information such as credit card numbers and account numbers from the data being provided to partners or clients and we obligate partners and clients to commit that panel members are not directly targeted with marketing communications or offers for products and services based on the information we share.

### Other Third Party Disclosure Practices

We may directly, or with our partners, use a 3rd party for database or software application services (such as customer support, email or survey) and for purposes of data quality, data cleansing. 

In addition, we may occasionally supplement information panel members provide us with information from consumer profile companies (including public record databases and credit reporting agencies) or use a third party service to combine client data with panel member behavioral information to be used for market research and segment modeling. In this instance, we protect your privacy by having these third parties sign a written, legally binding confidentiality agreement stipulating that they will not share data we provide them with any outside party and that any individual identifying information is to be used solely for the purpose of matching records or providing the agreed upon database service.

We may also use third party service providers to obtain additional online data, TV or video viewing data, application or mobile usage information and may integrate such information with the data that you provide us or that we collect from you. In all instances, any data we collect is used for research purposes only and is not used for targeting of marketing communications or to make commercial or economic decisions on an individual level.

We will never rent or sell your email address, contact information or other personally identifiable information to a third party except as described in this privacy policy under **Business Transitions** and **Legal Disclaimer**.

  * All online behavioral information is collected anonymously and is not stored along with any user identification token (like email address, IP address, name, etc.).
  * Compete’s data collection technology employs technical privacy rules to strip personal identifiable information and potentially sensitive information from clickstream data sent to Compete’s servers.
