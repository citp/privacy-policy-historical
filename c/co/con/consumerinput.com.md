# Consumer Input

  


Effective date: February 1, 2004

Protecting your privacy is our highest priority. Consumer Input is designed to be an anonymous research forum. As such, we go to great lengths to ensure that your anonymity will remain intact. Our data collection techniques have been designed to purge personally identifiable information from our databases.

Your email address will be used to contact you if you've won a prize or to alert you to additional research opportunities. We will never sell your email address to a third party, nor will we ever solicit you for sales purposes of any kind.

Other than your email address, we will not collect information that can be tied to you as an individual. In fact, we will only require your name if you are selected as a winner in one of our cash drawings.

We will not license, publish, or sell any information collected from our panelists that can be tied to an individual user. Nor will we use such information as part of a targeted marketing program. We offer our clients aggregate data concerning online consumer behavior by collecting information from the panel and, also, by licensing URL and demographic data (age, gender, household income, geographical location, etc.) from sources such as ISPs and browser companions. We honor the privacy of our panelists and the privacy policies of our licensors and do not knowingly collect or license personally identifiable information from our panelists or licensors.

Inadvertently, the URL information we collect and license sometimes contains personal information about Internet users. Potentially, a name, address, email address, or similar information that an Internet user enters into a Web page can become part of the URL that is transmitted to us and stored in our databases. While we have no control over what information third party websites put into their URLs or where they put it, we make every commercially viable effort to purge our databases of any personally identifiable information. The data collection software uses a proprietary rules engine to search through all URLs, before transmitting them to its database, to strip out any such personally identifiable information. We do not disclose the contents of individual URLs stored in our databases so we will not release or use this information. Further, we aggregate data on hundreds of thousands of users before supplying data to our clients, thereby ensuring that an individual's privacy remains intact at all times.

We transmit website usage information about visitors to our website to the servers of a reputable third party for the purpose of targeting Internet banner advertisements on other sites. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our third-party ad server on this site. The information that is collected and logged on our behalf through this technology is not personally identifiable. For more information about our third-party ad server, or to learn your choices about not having this non-personal information used to target ads to you, please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy).
