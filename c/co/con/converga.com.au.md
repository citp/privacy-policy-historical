Converga’s privacy practices are regulated by the New South Wales Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1988.

**What information do we collect?**   
When you look at the pages on the Converga site, our computers automatically record information that identifies, for each page accessed: 

  * the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the machine which has accessed it; 
  * your top-level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc.); 
  * the address of your server; 
  * the date and time of your visit to the site; 
  * the pages accessed and documents downloaded; 
  * the previous site visited; and 
  * the type of browser and operating system you have used. 



**How do we use the information collected?**   
The information collected during each visit is aggregated with similar logged information and published in reports in order for CSSD to identify patterns of usage of the site. This will assist us in improving the Converga site and the services offered on it.

CSSD will not disclose or publish information that identifies individual machines, or potentially identifies sub-groupings of addresses, without consent or otherwise in accordance with the New South Wales Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1988.

**What exceptions are there to this rule?**   
CSSD will collect, use and disclose more extensive information than stated above in the following circumstances:

  * unauthorised attempts to access files which are not published Converga pages; 
  * unauthorised tampering or interference with files published on the Converga site; 
  * unauthorised attempts to index the contents of the Converga site by other sites; 
  * attempts to intercept messages of other users of the Converga site; 
  * communications which are defamatory, abusive, vilify individuals or groups or which give rise to a suspicion that an offence is being committed; and 
  * attempts to otherwise compromise the security of the web server, breach the laws of the State of New South Wales or Commonwealth of Australia, or interfere with the enjoyment of the Converga site by other users. 



CSSD reserves the right to make disclosures to relevant authorities where the use of the Converga site raises a suspicion that an offence is being, or has been, committed.

In the event of an investigation, CSSD will provide access to data to any law enforcement agency that may exercise a warrant to inspect our logs.

**Is the information stored securely?**   
Yes. Information collected is stored in an appropriately secure format and held by CSSD for archival purposes. When the information is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected it is deleted.

**What will we do with information provided in Feedback?**   
CSSD provides feedback facilities on the Converga site to allow users to provide input into the future development of the site and to comment on the provision of service by the department.

The provision of personal details on feedback is optional.

Users may provide personal details for the purpose of receiving a reply to their feedback. This information will only be used for the purpose for which it was provided. We will not add your email address or name to any mailing list.

CSSD may publish aggregated information about feedback on the site, to the extent that it does not identify or cannot be used to identify individual users.

**Who else has access to information within the Department?  
** CSSD captures this information on its own computers. Access to the raw data is restricted to a limited number of officers in CSSD for the purpose of analysis and to report on the success of Converga in meeting CSSD’s communication and access objectives. If you would like to access information held about you by CSSD please contact the Privacy Officer, Converga, Level 31, BT Tower, 1 Market Street, Sydney, phone 02 9264 7200 and/or email [information@converga.com.au](mailto:information@converga.com.au)

**Will this policy be updated over time?  
** Due to the developing nature of privacy principles for online communication, this policy may be modified or expanded in light of new developments or issues that may arise from time to time. The amended policy will be posted to this site and will operate from the time it is posted.
