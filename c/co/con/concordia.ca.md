## Email privacy

Concordia collects your personal information mainly to stay in touch with You. Email communications in particular are aimed at keeping you informed about Concordia news, events, surveys and appeals. 

Students may send a request to [internalcomms@concordia.ca](mailto:internalcomms@concordia.ca) and alumni may send a request to [alumni@concordia.ca](mailto:alumni@concordia.ca) that Concordia refrain from using personal information for any of the purposes outlined above. Since some communications programs may already be in progress at the time such a request is received, alumni may continue to receive communications for a short time while the change is being implemented.

Concordia faculty and staff cannot unsubscribe from NOW news emails.
