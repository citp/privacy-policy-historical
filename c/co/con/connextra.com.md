# Connextra | PressArea

Connextra Ltd believes that all consumers who use our web site and products are entitled to know that their personal identifying information is protected under all circumstances, as stated in our privacy policy:

  * Any personal identifying information that is obtained through the registration and use of the Connextra web site, such as your name (optional) and e-mail address, is maintained by Connextra in a secure and protected environment. Your e-mail address is used only to send you newsletters and other special offers and information.

  * Connextra may release generalized cumulative information to sponsors, but will never release your personal data to any third party without your expressed permission. Your personal data is safe, protected, and secure.

  * Some of the information and special offers are provided by third-party sponsors, based on the information you provide. These offers are governed by the sponsor's privacy policy, with which you should familiarize yourself.

  * The privacy policy applies to all countries, worldwide, and includes all web sites that are created and maintained either by or for Connextra.

  * Connextra does not insert cookies into your operating system.




## **Sharing Information**

Connextra employs contractors for some technology-related tasks. These contractors, however, are bound by a confidentiality agreement that makes them liable for prosecution if they remove any data from the offices or if they use company or consumer information for any purpose other than that defined by the terms of their employment. 

We do not maintain data in retrievable form. Because we delete the user's e-mail address after we send the activation code, even Connextra cannot retrieve personal identifying information about an individual. 

## **Security**

Our web site has security measures in place to protect against loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control. Any unauthorized attempt to defeat this security or otherwise enter into sections of our software, hardware, or servers placed on the Internet will result in prosecution of the offender to the maximum allowed by law.
