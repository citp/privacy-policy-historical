### Concord Accounts

The Concord account was designed to a be a simple way for a person to benefit from Concord Consortium services. These services include:

  * Free Software Downloads
  * Subscriptions to E-mail / Print Mailing Lists
  * Online Course Registration



The only thing you need to provide us with to get a Concord account is a valid e-mail address. Additional information may be necessary for some services.

If you download our free software, we may contact you regarding available updates or critical problems.

If you subscribe (opt-in) to an e-mail mailing list(s), we will send you materials via e-mail only from the mailing list(s) you subscribed to. At any time, you may opt-out by going to your account and clicking on the Subscriptions link.

If you subscribe (opt-in) to a Print mailing list, we will send materials through Postal mail if you have given us your valid US postal address. At any time, you may opt-out by going to your account and clicking on the Subscriptions link.

Online course registrants will be contacted by course instructors.

### @Concord Newsletter

We require a valid email address for Print subscriptions to our @Concord Newsletter. Your email address will become your 'user id' and allow you to update personal information directly at our website. Athough we require your email address, we will not send you unsolicited email or otherwise disclose your information to other organizations (as stated above).
