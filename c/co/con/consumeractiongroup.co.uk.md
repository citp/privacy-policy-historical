    This policy applies to all forums operated by Reclaim the Right Limited, and includes (but is not limited to) the Consumer Action Group, 
    Bank Action Group, Debt Action Group and the Consumer Forums. Hereafter, these are referred to as the Consumer Forums.
    
    
    WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS
    
    Your privacy is a very important matter, and is taken very seriously by the Consumer Forums. Please read the following to learn more 
    about our privacy policy. In addition to our own attitude to the importance of your privacy, we are also registered with the Information 
    Commissioner under The Data Protection Act. Our Data Protection Registration number is Z9440256
    
    
    HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
    
    This policy covers how we treat personal information that we collect and receive, including information relating to your past use of the 
    Consumer Forums. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or 
    telephone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
    
    This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that the Consumer Forums, or Reclaim the Right Limited, do not own or control, 
    or to people that we do not employ or manage.
    
    Because of our obligations under the Data Protection Act, we conform with all UK and European standards for the protection of privacy.

    The Consumer Forums collect personal information when you register with any of our forums or buy our products. When you register we may 
    ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, postal code, occupation, industry, and personal interests.

    The Consumer Forums collects information about your transactions with us, and with some of our business partners, including information 
    about your use of any financial products and services that we might offer.

    The Consumer Forums uses information for the following general purposes: to customise the advertising and content you see, fulfil your 
    requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for our internal 
    purposes.
    
    The Consumer Forums does not contact its registered users or its visitors about any products or services other than through its newsletter 
    which has been subscribed to as a part of the forum registration process. The Consumer Forums does not contact any person if that person 
    has not registered as a forum user - even if that person has bought products or services through our website pages.
    
    
    CHILDREN
    
    The Consumer Forums does not differentiate between adults and children in relation to its data use policy, and the same safeguards are 
    applied regardless of age. However we remind parents to be vigilant over their children's use of the Internet, and if they have any concerns 
    about the Consumer Forums websites they should use the "Complaints about Website Content" button on the left side of the main forum webpage.
    
    
    UNSOLICITED TELEPHONE CALLS
    
    If you receive an unsolicited telephone call offering legal services from any individual or company claiming to be from the Consumer Forums, 
    Consumer Action Group, CAG, or any similar name, please email admin@consumeractiongroup.co.uk and do not agree to any service that may be 
    offered.
    
    We do not do this.
    
    Any company offering legal services in these circumstances will not be authorised by the Consumer Forums, and will be acting in breach of 
    the law.
