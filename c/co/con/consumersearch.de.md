# Privacy Policy | ConsumerSearch.com

Thank you for visiting ConsumerSearch, a production of ConsumerSearch, Inc. ("ConsumerSearch", "we", "us" or "our"). At ConsumerSearch, we respect your privacy, and we understand the importance of the information you entrust to us. This Privacy Policy describes our practices concerning the information collected through our website (whether existing now or in the future, collectively, the “Services”). Below we describe what information we collect when you use the Services, how we protect that information, with whom we share it, and what your privacy options are. By using the Services, you consent to our collection and use of your data as described in this Privacy Policy. 

This Privacy Policy only applies to properties we own and operate. Our properties may provide links to third party websites and this Privacy Policy will not apply to any information you may provide while on such third party websites. We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy against new technologies, business practices, and our users’ needs, and may make changes to the Privacy Policy accordingly. Please check this page periodically for updates. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy here, along with its effective date, and notify you by means of a notice on our website.

## 1\. The Information We Collect

We explain the two ways that we collect and process information about you.

 **A. Information You Provide to Us**

 **a. Feedback and Email Newsletter:** You may choose to submit feedback (such as reviews, tips, or comments) that may be shared with others through our Services. The feedback that you submit through the Services may be made available for other users of Consumer Search.com to read. We may also display your feedback on the Services, share it with businesses, and further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services. We will however only use your name and/or email address for the purpose of answering to your feedback and when you sign up to receive our email newsletter.

 **b. Communications:** If you participate in a survey, poll, promotion, contest, or sweepstakes; submit a customer service or other inquiry to us; request to receive certain communications from us; or contact us about employment opportunities posted to the Services, we may collect contact information such as your name, address, email address, or telephone number.

 **B. Information We Collect about your computer or mobile device when you Use the Services**

When you use the Services, we automatically collect and store certain information about your computer or device and your activities, including:

1\. IP address of your computer

2\. Unique mobile device identifier

3\. Technical information about your computer or mobile device such as type of device, mobile device ID number, web browser (Internet Explorer 8, etc.), other browser information (e.g. size, connection speed and connection type), and operating system or platform (Mac, Windows XP, etc.)

4\. Your preferences and settings (time zone, language, etc.)

5\. If you are using a mobile device, your mobile device's geographic location (specific geographic location if you have enabled collection of that information, or general geographic location automatically). Please see the section **"About Location Information"** below for further information.

6\. Internet provider (Verizon, Comcast, etc.) or mobile carrier name (AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, etc.)

7\. The URL of the last webpage you visited before visiting ConsumerSearch

8\. Information about your activity on the Services (e.g., your search queries, search results selected, clicks, pages viewed, how long you visited our Services, etc.)

 **About Location Information**

When you use one of our location-enabled services (for example, when you access Services from a mobile device), we may need to collect and process information about your actual GPS location (including the latitude, longitude or altitude of your mobile device) and the time the location information was recorded. Some of these services require your personal data for the feature to work and we may associate location data with your device ID and other information we hold about you. We keep this data for no longer than is reasonably necessary for providing our services. If you wish to use the particular feature, you will be asked to consent to your data being used for this purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time by disabling the relevant feature. We have explained how you can disable the collection of Mobile Device Location Information below:

 ** _How to Disable the Collection of Mobile Device Location Information._**

  * If you do not want your location information collected when you use the Services from a mobile device, please follow these instructions:
  * If you are using an Apple device, click on “General,” then “Reset,” then “Reset Location and Privacy.” This will turn off location functionality for all of your apps so that the next time you download or use an app, you will be asked again to provide your consent for us and others to access your location information.
  * If you are using an Android device, visit device settings, click “Location,” and then click the boxes for the particular applications for which you would like to disable location services.
  * If your device changes the above methods of disabling the collection of mobile device location, please contact your device manufacturer or platform provider to determine how to disable the collection of this information.



 **Cookies, Mobile Device IDs and Online Advertising:**

 ** ** Cookies: We use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, mobile device IDs, “flash cookies” and similar files or technologies to collect and store the information we automatically collect about your computer, device, and Services usage. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer that enables us to recognize you when you visit our website, store your preferences and settings, enhance your experience by delivering content specific to your interests, perform research and analytics, track your use of our Services, and assist with security and administrative functions.

If you choose to decline or remove cookies, please note that this may affect the quality of the services. In addition, deleting or disabling cookies on one browser is unlikely to delete them on other browsers or other computers. Thus, you may have to delete or disable cookies in more than one location.

Major browsers provide users with various options when it comes to cookies. Users can usually set their browsers to block all third-party cookies (which are those set by third-party companies collecting information on websites operated by other companies), block all cookies (including first-party cookies such as the ones Consumer Search uses to collect search activity information about its users), or block specific cookies.

A pixel tag (also called a web beacon or clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email), and is used to count or track things like activity on a webpage or ad impressions or clicks, as well as to access cookies stored on users’ computers. ConsumerSearch pixel tags are used to measure the popularity of our various pages, features and services. Advertising company pixel tags are used to measure the number of ad impressions and the performance of ads on our site, and to access the advertising company’s cookies placed on your computer. Data analytics company pixel tags are used to aggregate information about our advertising and your engagement with our site for market research, product improvement, revenue tracking and advertising optimization.

Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised through the Services, including social networking services, may also use cookies or similar tools, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other practices.

Online and Mobile Advertising: Advertisers and advertising networks place ads (including sponsored links in search results) on our website. These companies as well as data analytics companies who service them may collect information, such as your computer’s IP address, browser information, mobile device ID, and search queries, as you use our Services.

These companies also may use web technologies such as cookies and pixel tags to collect data about you when you visit our site. Cookies from advertising companies enable them to track your activity across various sites where they display ads and record your activities, so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you. You may opt-out of receiving targeted online advertising from advertising networks that is delivered on ConsumerSearch and other websites.

Advertising companies may also use and store your mobile device ID to track your use of the Services, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and show ads that they consider relevant to you in various mobile services that you use. If you are using an iOS device and you do not want to receive tailored in-application ads that relate to your interests, you may opt-out by accessing the following link on your device: [http://oo.apple.com](http://oo.apple.com/ "http://oo.apple.com"). If you are using an iOS6 device, you also may limit the delivery of tailored ads by: Open Settings and tap “General” then tap “About”; Scroll to the bottom of About and tap “Advertising”; Flip “Limit Ad Tracking” to ON. If you are using an Android device and you do not wish to receive tailored in-application ads, you can visit Google’s Ads Preferences page from a browser on your device and make your choices there.
