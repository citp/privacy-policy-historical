## Personal Information

This information used for our internal performance monitoring, kept for a long time and not shared with third parties.

## E-mail Addresses

We guarantee that your email address and any personal information will not be subject to sale or lease for personal or commercial purposes.

## User’s Files Handling and Keeping

We convert more than 10 million files (300 TB of data) every month. We delete input files and all temporary files instantly after any file conversion. We delete output files instantly when the user clicks 'X' in web panel, otherwise, output files deleted after 24 hours. This implies that you can delete your files on your own anytime. We can’t make a backup copy of your files even if you ask us to do so. To save a backup copy of or all the contents of the file we need your user agreement.

Your files are exclusively bound to your IP address. Only the user, who initiated the conversion, can download the result file.
