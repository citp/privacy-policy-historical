## 1\. Information Collected

For each visitor to this Web Site, our web servers may automatically recognize and collect non-personally identifiable information, such as inbound domain names, your computer's IP address, the type of browser in use, and pages viewed. This data tells us which pages our users visit and what information they volunteer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

We only collect personally identifiable information about you when you voluntarily submit such information to us, for example by signing up for the CI newsletter or to donate. Depending on the service you choose, the personal identifiable information collected may include your name, e-mail address, address, phone number, payment details, organizational affiliation and similar information ("Personal Information").

## 2\. Use of Information

Any Personal Information we collect is used only for internal review, to improve our web content, to optimize your web experience and, in some cases, to customize the content and/or layout of select pages.

In general, we will only use Personal Information you provide to us for the purpose for which it was provided, for example:
