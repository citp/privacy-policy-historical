                    <h2>Governing Law; Arbitration</h2>
                    <p>You agree that: (i) www.CONSUMERTRACK.com shall be deemed solely based in the State of California; and (ii) www.CONSUMERTRACK.com shall be deemed a passive Web site that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over CONSUMERTRACK, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than the State of California. This Privacy Policy is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California, without regard for principles of conflicts of laws. Any civil action, claim, dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Privacy Policy shall be referred to final and binding arbitration, before a single arbitrator, under the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association in Los Angeles County, California.</p>
                    <p>THEREFORE, YOU DO NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS AND YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OR BRING CLASS ACTIONS. BY USING WWW.CONSUMERTRACK.COM YOU CONSENT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS. You and CONSUMERTRACK shall select the arbitrator, and if you and CONSUMERTRACK are unable to reach agreement on selection of the arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the notice of arbitration is served, then the American Arbitration Association shall select the arbitrator. Arbitration shall not commence until the party requesting it has deposited One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) with the arbitrator for the arbitrator’s fees and costs. The party requesting arbitration shall advance such sums as are required from time to time by the arbitrator to pay the arbitrator’s fees and costs until the prevailing party is determined or the parties have agreed in writing to an alternate allocation of fees and costs.</p>
                    <p>Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive upon you and CONSUMERTRACK and your and CONSUMERTRACK’s respective administrators, executors, legal representatives, successors and assigns, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in no event shall either you or CONSUMERTRACK be entitled to punitive, special, indirect or consequential damages and both you and CONSUMERTRACK hereby waive your and CONSUMERTRACK’s respective rights to any punitive, special, indirect or consequential damages, including, but not limited to, damages for any loss of profit, revenue or business.</p>
                    <p>Should a dispute arise and should the arbitration provisions herein become inapplicable or unenforceable, or in any instance of any lawsuit between you and CONSUMERTRACK, jurisdiction over and venue of any suit shall be exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting in Los Angeles County, California.</p>
                    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
                    <p>If any portion of this Privacy Policy is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator, this Privacy Policy as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of this Privacy Policy that is unlawful, void or unenforceable shall be stricken from this Privacy Policy. The headings contained in this Privacy Policy are for convenience of reference only, are not to be considered a part of this Privacy Policy, and shall not limit or otherwise affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p>All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made in this Privacy Policy, as may be amended by CONSUMERTRACK from time to time, shall survive your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.</p>
