				<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>ConsumerTrack Inc owns and operates thousands of consumers Websites and portions of other Web pages and Web content through which you have accessed this Privacy Policy (collectively, “WEBSITES”). By visiting, using and/or submitting information to WEBSITES, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy and the terms and conditions of WEBSITE’s Agreement of Terms of Use.</p>
<p>ConsumerTrack, Inc. and our affiliated companies worldwide (“ConsumerTrack”) are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) you share with us. ConsumerTrack has established this Online PRIVACY POLICY so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.</p>
<p>Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information. In general, you can visit ConsumerTrack’s Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.</p>
<p>If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the Web, we may transfer that Information within ConsumerTrack or to ConsumerTrack’s third-party service providers, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.</p>
<p>ConsumerTrack strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, ConsumerTrack intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online PRIVACY POLICY even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an “adequate” level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong><br>
Some of our Web pages utilize “cookies” and other tracking technologies. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about website activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Web user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.</p>
<p>You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the website. If you prefer that your browser does not store this cookie information, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature. In order to “opt out” of the benefits of cookies, you can manually delete your cookies by following the instructions contained in the “Help” section of your browser. Alternatively, simply click the “OPT OUT NOW” link provided, below. ConsumerTrack uses a limited number of third party providers to manage cookies, and when you click the link below, you will be opted out of their tracking systems. Note that separate browser windows will be opened, and you need to allow pop-ups for this to happen. Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our website and your Web experience. We may also analyze information that does not contain Personal Information for trends and statistics.</p>
<p>You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to ConsumerTrack. The notice we intend to provide where ConsumerTrack collects Personal Information on the Web should help you to make this choice.

<p>If you chose to have a relationship with ConsumerTrack, such as a contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.</p>

Once we receive your instruction, we will promptly take corrective action.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
Wherever your Personal Information may be held within ConsumerTrack or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Access/Accuracy</strong><br>
To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, ConsumerTrack wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information.

BY USING WWW.CONSUMERTRACK.COM YOU CONSENT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS.  You and CONSUMERTRACK shall select the arbitrator, and if you and CONSUMERTRACK are unable to reach agreement on selection of the arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the notice of arbitration is served, then the American Arbitration Association shall select the arbitrator. Arbitration shall not commence until the party requesting it has deposited One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) with the arbitrator for the arbitrator’s fees and costs. The party requesting arbitration shall advance such sums as are required from time to time by the arbitrator to pay the arbitrator’s fees and costs until the prevailing party is determined or the parties have agreed in writing to an alternate allocation of fees and costs.</p>
<p>Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive upon you and CONSUMERTRACK and your and CONSUMERTRACK’s respective administrators, executors, legal representatives, successors and assigns, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><br>
If any portion of this Privacy Policy is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator, this Privacy Policy as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of this Privacy Policy that is unlawful, void or unenforceable shall be stricken from this Privacy Policy.<br>
