# Privacy Policy

We use location information from location-enabled devices (including through GPS, cellular, and Wi-Fi networks) and from third parties to determine your location and as a means to provide you with the most relevant data and search information for the Services.

You can disable location services through your mobile device’s settings or the App’s settings by turning off the location information. But quitting and reopening the App may automatically reset the settings to allow the transmission of location information, even if you do not manually adjust the settings.

Our Services include 4 User Levels. A User can see profile information and interact with only those Users that are at the same level or below.

User Levels are determined by the following:
