        <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="pad">
    <h4>Website Visitors</h4>

    <p>Like most website operators, Convore collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
    that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
    referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Convore’s purpose in collecting non-personally
    identifying information is to better understand how Convore's visitors use its website. From time to time,
    Convore may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report
    on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

    <p>Convore also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
    for logged in users and for users leaving messages on Convore.com groups. Convore only discloses logged in user
    and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
    information as described below.</p>

    <h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

    <p>Certain visitors to Convore's websites choose to interact with Convore in ways that require Convore
    to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Convore gathers depends
    on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a group at
    <a href="https://convore.com">Convore.com</a> to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in
    transactions with Convore are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal
    and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Convore collects such information
    only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Convore.
    Convore does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always
    refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
    website-related activities.</p>

    <h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>

    <p>Convore may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Convore may
    monitor the most popular groups on the Convore.com site. Convore may display this information publicly
    or provide it to others. However, Convore does not disclose personally-identifying information other than
    as described below.</p>

    <h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

    <p>Convore discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its
    employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it
    on Convore's behalf or to provide services available at Convore's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose
    it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home
    country; by using Convore's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Convore will not rent
    or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,
    contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Convore discloses potentially personally-identifying and
    personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena or court order, or when Convore believes in good faith
    that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Convore, third parties or the public at large.
    If you are a registered user of the Convore website and have supplied your email address, Convore may occasionally
    send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on
    with Convore and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect
    to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
    mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us
    support other users. Convore takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
    alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

    <h4>Cookies</h4>

    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides
    to the website each time the visitor returns. Convore uses cookies to help Convore identify and track visitors, their usage
    of Convore website, and their website access preferences. Convore visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
    computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Convore's websites, with the drawback that certain features
    of Convore's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

    <h4>Ads</h4>

    <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies
    allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you
    or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that
    they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Convore and does not cover the use
    of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

    <h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>

    <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Convore may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Convore's
    sole discretion. Convore encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have
    a Convore.com account, you should also check your dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site
    after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
