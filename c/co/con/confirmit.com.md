# Confirmit Privacy Notice | Confirmit

## **1\. Introduction**

Your privacy is important to the Confirmit group of companies (“ **Confirmit** ”). This privacy notice discloses the information practices for Confirmit-controlled web sites ([www.confirmit.com](http://www.confirmit.com/) and [extranet.confirmit.com](https://extranet.confirmit.com/)) and for Confirmit-provided mobile applications (AskMe, CAPI, Mobile Panel, SODA, and Confirmit Go), including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. This policy applies to Confirmit customers, to web-visitors, registered account holders of our products, app mobile users, and applicants to positions at Confirmit.

**2\. Definitions**

In this privacy notice, the term “ **personal data** ” includes:

  * Under the laws of the United States, personal data shall include any “non-public personal information” as that term is defined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act found at 15 USC Subchapter 1 §6809(4), and "protected health information" as defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act found at 45 CFR §160.103.
  * Under the laws of the countries in the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”), personal data shall have the meaning given to it in Directive 95/46/EC (the “ **EU Directive** ”) and in the General Data Protection Regulation (“ **GDPR** ”).
  * Under the laws of Australia, personal data shall include information or an opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: (a) whether the information is true or not; and (b) whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.



“ **Data controller** ” means the party that determines the purposes or means of the processing of the personal data.

“ **Data processor** ” means the party that processes the personal data on behalf of the data controller.

## **3\. Confirmit’s two roles as data processor and data controller**

**3.A**. For the  **first type** , Confirmit acts as data processor and as a software-as-a-service (“ **SaaS** ”) provider for companies conducting data collection and reporting activities via the Internet or mobile apps. You may be submitting responses to web surveys or app surveys via mobile devices, and the template of the survey may state "Powered by Confirmit." Surveys launched by Confirmit’s customers may be hosted on Confirmit's SaaS environments, or alternatively they may be hosted on the customer's hosting environment on Internet other than Confirmit’s.

  
In any of these cases, please be aware that it is our customers as data controllers who are initiating or performing the data collection, who determine from whom to collect personal data, and who define how to use the collected personal data. Confirmit is acting as a data processor, and our customers use the SaaS at their own initiative. Confirmit will therefore process any and all categories of personal data uploaded to or collected onto the SaaS by our customers. For more details about how Confirmit’s customer intends to use your personal data, please refer to the privacy notice of the Confirmit customer from whom the email or the web survey originates. For more information related to Confirmit’s role as a data processor, please see Section 4 below, “Confirmit as a data processor.”

**3.B.**  The  **second type**  of sites we manage is related to information offered by Confirmit to its business customers, prospects, and other visitors on the Confirmit website, the Confirmit extranet, and other sites we offer access to where Confirmit acts as the data controller.

## **4\. Confirmit as a data processor**

**4.A. Our role as a processor**

In relation to our roles as SaaS provider and data processor, Confirmit processes information under the instructions of its customers and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data Confirmit collects or processes on behalf of its customer.

If you seek access to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate personal data, or if you seek to invoke any other rights in respect to the personal data under applicable laws, you should direct your query to Confirmit’s customer as the data controller. We will honor and support any instructions our customer provide us with respect to your personal data. If Confirmit is requested by Confirmit’s customer to take actions on personal data (access, update, export, delete or other as required), we will respond within a reasonable timeframe in accordance with applicable laws.

If you would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our SaaS service, please contact the customer directly.

If you have reached out to our customer and are not getting a reply, you may approach Confirmit in accordance with section 6 below. 

**4.B. Data storage, data access, data transfers, and data retention**

Personal data that our customers collect from you may, subject to adequate confidentiality undertakings, and for the sole purpose of providing our customers with the services they have contracted from us, be transferred to or accessed by personnel of Confirmit-affiliated entities (see list [here](https://www.confirmit.com/Contact/) _)_ , and to or by third party companies  and subcontractors that help us provide our services. In any such case, the personnel granted access to your personal data will have been deemed by their managers to have a reasonable business need to do so. 

Where Confirmit transfers personal data to one of its affiliates, we will have legitimate transfer mechanisms in place. See more details in section 5.F. below. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.

Depending on which SaaS environment you have been invited to take a survey, your personal data will be stored on servers in London (survey.euro.confirmit.com), or Dallas (survey.confirmit.com), or Sydney (survey.confirmit.com.au). Other URLs may be used by our customers. The data center of the SaaS environments are managed under our control by Rackspace entities in the [United States](https://www.rackspace.com/en-gb/certifications), in the [United Kingdom](https://www.rackspace.com/en-gb/compliance), and in [Australia](https://www.rackspace.com/en-au).

Confirmit leverages [Microsoft Azure Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) to provide additional Horizons environments based on data storage in new regions. As of the date of this Privacy Notice, Horizons Cloud is offered in Canada and in Germany. 

Where Confirmit transfers personal data to Rackspace or to other subcontractors as agreed in our contracts with our customer, we will have legitimate transfer mechanisms in place, and where the subcontractor processes the personal data outside of the EEA and in a jurisdiction not deemed by the EU to meet the applicable [EU adequacy standards](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en), we are requiring the subcontractor to enter into Model Clauses with us.

We will retain personal data our customers have instructed us to process for them for as long as needed to provide services to our customers in accordance with the contractual terms in our agreements with them. Our customers can at any time instruct for such personal data to be updated, exported, deleted, or as otherwise required. Confirmit will retain personal data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and in accordance with our customer agreements (including secure encrypted off-site back-up retention for up to 52 weeks).

**4.C. Security measures**

Confirmit operates under a strong security and privacy regime. Confirmit has successfully undergone third party Service Organization Control auditing (SOC 2, based on ISAE3402 / SSAE18 / AT101) in relation to its SaaS operations. The SOC 2 report provides assurance that we have designed and implemented effective security controls as defined in the SOC 2 standards.  During the examination, the independent auditors evaluated and tested controls over the following domains:

·         Organization and management

·         Communications

·         Risk management, design, and implementation of controls

·         Monitoring of controls

·         Logical and physical access controls

·         Systems operation

·         Change Management

If your personal data is stored on Confirmit's SaaS environments, you are welcome to read more about how we protect your personal data by applying industry leading security measures and performing ongoing security tests and controls. Please refer to the PowerPoint file available for you to download from [here](https://extranet.confirmit.com/Confirmit-Horizons/Overview/security-features/).

**4.D. Device information**

In relation to the first type of Internet site discussed in section 3.A above, when you download and use mobile apps produced by Confirmit, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and where applicable, the device identifier (or "UDID").

The mobile apps do not require location permission in order to be used. However, our customers who are using our mobile apps in order to collect personal data from you may request that the mobile apps collect your precise geolocation. Should location be requested, you will be prompted by the operating system of your device with a message that the mobile app has requested to access the device location (please note that Android OS 6 or older versions lack of this feature).  You can accept or reject that request. If permission has been granted, this permission can be later changed at any time under the operating system settings area.

Depending on our customers’ use of the mobile app, the mobile app may also use beacons or similar technologies as part of the survey taking.  

**4.E. Cookies and Tracking Technologies on the SaaS environment**

We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons, scripts, eTags, local storage (HTML5) or similar tracking technologies.  These technologies are used on the SaaS environment to provide you with a better user experience, including authenticate users of, or personalize the content on the SaaS website or online service. They are also used to preserve functionality in our SaaS platforms, such as monitoring of network communications, maintain or analyze the functioning of the SaaS website or online service, protect the security or integrity of the user, SaaS website or online service.

You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on the SaaS environment.

For information about cookies when you provide personal data to our customers via our SaaS environment, please refer to our [Cookie Policy](http://www.confirmit.com/cookie-policy/). We do not use cookies in surveys you are invited to take via an email invitation with a clickable link or via pop-ups or web intercepts, but our customers using the SaaS may launch their own cookies, which we may not be aware of. Please contact the company inviting you to access the surveys or reports delivered via the SaaS for information about their cookies.

**5\. Confirmit as a data controller**

**5.A. Our role as a data controller**

The security of your personal data is important to us.  We follow generally recognized industry standards to protect the personal data submitted to us during transmission and once it is received. In general, you can visit Confirmit on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal data about yourself, except that we may log IP address and geolocation. There are times, however, when Confirmit or our partners may require additional personal data from you.

Confirmit will act as a data controller where, for example, you visit our web-sites and provide us with your contact details to obtain access to resources, or where we store your details as part of our management of accounts you have with us in your role as a customer. Confirmit also acts as a data controller during recruitment processes, see section 5.Q below. Where Confirmit acts as the data controller, you may choose to provide us with your personal data in a variety of situations.
