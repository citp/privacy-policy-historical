<p>Constant-Content reserves the right to update this policy from time to time, on reasonable notice to you. Your continued use of any website or service covered by this policy after we have notified you of an amendment will constitute your agreement to the same.</p>
<p>In this statement, when we talk about “Constant-Content” or “we” or “our”, we are referring to Constant-Content Media Company, and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. 	Personal Information</h3>
<p>In connection with your use, from time to time, of the Constant-Content website or service, you may be required to provide Constant-Content with certain personal information, including without limitation, your name, address, telephone number, electronic mail addresss, credit card information, bank account information, and your social insurance or social security number (collectively, your “Personal Information”).</p>
<p>Constant-Content will use your Personal Information to establish your account, to communicate with you, to remit payments to you from time to time if and when due, and for ongoing record keeping, as required by law.</p>
<p>Constant-Content will not release Personal Information about you without your permission, except:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) as permitted in this policy statement; </li>
<li>(b) as permitted in any written agreement between you and Constant-Content; </li>
<li>(c) where we believe it is reasonably necessary to conduct business; and </li>
<li>(d) where we believe it is necessary to enforce our rights under any agreement between you and Constant-Content.</li>
</ul>
