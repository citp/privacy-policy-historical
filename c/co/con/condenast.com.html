In addition to reviewing this privacy policy, please read our <a href="http://www.condenast.com/useragreement.html" target="_blank">User Agreement</a>. Your use of CondeNast.com ("Website") constitutes agreement to its terms and conditions.<br><br>

This Website is produced by CondeNet, Inc. ("Service Provider"). This policy does not cover information collected on sites linked to from the Website.<br><br>
 
This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; the date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page, so check back often. Continued access of the Website by you will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy. <br><br>

It is the goal of our Website to bring you information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, protect your privacy. The following is a summary of the various ways we treat the information you provide us while using our site.<br><br>
 
<b>THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THE WEBSITE COLLECTS</b> <br><br>

The Website generally collects personally identifying information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey, make a purchase, subscribe to our publication(s), or register for any portion of our services, you are asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name or phone number. Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested.<br><br>
 
<b>HOW THE WEBSITE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU</b> <br><br>

Service Provider uses information you supply through the Website  to provide you with the service you have requested. For example, if you subscribe to any of our publications, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing address to send you the publication. Similarly, if you enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products or services, or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs. <br><br>

Service Provider does not sell our users' e-mail addresses.  However, unless otherwise specified, we may share e-mail addresses and sell or share all other information with our affiliates and with carefully selected companies who we think can offer you services and products of interest to you. If you do not wish to have your information shared, write to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@condenet.com">privacy@condenet.com</a>. If you do not wish to receive future commercial communications from us by e-mail, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the e-mail. If you've registered on any part of the Website, we may provide an online method to change or update your member preferences or information on the website, or you can send us an e-mail with your revised preferences or information to <a href="mailto:privacy@condenet.com">privacy@condenet.com</a>.<br><br>
 
We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or forums and job search software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services. And if you choose to purchase items through features on our site, we may forward your information to third parties for services such as credit card processing and order fulfillment. There are also times when you provide information about yourself to us in areas of the site that are managed or participated in by third parties, such as our auction services or shopping areas. In such cases, the information may be used by us and by such third party(ies), each pursuant to its own policies. We may also provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or match your interests. While Service Provider will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, Service Provider does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties. There may also be occasion when we are legally required to provide access to our database in order to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings. In those instances, the information is provided only for that purpose. <br><br>

While your individual information is protected as outlined above, we reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners. <br><br>
