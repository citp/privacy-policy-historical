              In addition to reviewing this privacy policy, please read our User 
              Agreement. Your use of Condé Nast constitutes agreement to its terms 
              and conditions. <br>
              <br>
              Condé Nast is produced by CondeNet, Inc. This policy does not cover 
              information collected on sites linked to from Condé Nast. <br>
              <br>
              This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; the date 
              of the most recent revisions will appear on this page, so check 
              back often. Continued access of Condé Nast by you will constitute 
              your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy. 
              <br>
              <br>
              It is the goal of Condé Nast to bring you information that is tailored 
              to your individual needs and, at the same time, protect your privacy. 
              The following is a summary of the various ways we treat the information 
              you provide us while using our site. <br>
              <br>
              THE TYPE OF INFORMATION CONDÉ NAST COLLECTS <br>
              <br>
              Condé Nast generally collects personally identifying information 
              with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you 
              enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey, make a purchase, 
              subscribe to our magazines, subscribe to our newsletters or register 
              for any portion of our services, you are asked to provide information 
              such as your e-mail address, name or phone number. Optional information 
              such as your age or gender may also be requested. <br>
              <br>
              HOW CONDÉ NAST USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU <br>
              <br>
              Condé Nast uses this information to provide you with the service 
              you have requested. If you subscribe to any of our magazines, we 
              may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and 
              your mailing address to send you your magazine. Similarly, if you 
              enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify 
              you if you are a winner. We may also use the information to communicate 
              with you about new features, products or services, or to improve 
              the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs. <br>
              <br>
              Condé Nast does not sell our users' e-mail addresses. However, unless 
              otherwise specified, we may share e-mail address and sell or share 
              all other information with our affiliates and with carefully selected 
              companies who we think can offer you services and products of interest 
              to you. If you do not wish to have your information shared, write 
              to us at [privacy@Condé Nast]. If you do not wish to receive communications 
              from us, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within 
              the e-mail. <br>
              <br>
              We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide 
              us with services, such as technical maintenance or forums software, 
              but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide 
              those services. And if you choose to purchase items through features 
              on our site, we may forward your information to third parties for 
              services such as credit card processing and order fulfillment. There 
              are also times when you provide information about yourself to us 
              in areas of the site that are managed or participated in by third 
              parties, such as our featured merchant partners. In such cases, 
              the information may be used by us and by such third party(ies), 
              each pursuant to its own policies. We may also provide your information 
              to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet 
              your needs or match your interests. While Condé Nast will seek to 
              require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies 
              and will not authorize them to use this information except for the 
              express purpose for which it is provided, Condé Nast does not bear 
              any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties. 
              There may also be occasion when we are legally required to provide 
              access to our database in order to cooperate with police investigations 
              or other legal proceedings. In those instances, the information 
              is provided only for that purpose. <br>
              <br>
              COOKIES <br>
              <br>
              You may have read about "cookies," nuggets of information that are 
              placed by a Website in a storage place on your own computer. We 
              use cookies to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns 
              on the site, to deliver editorial content, and to record registration 
              and personalization information. For example, if you register on 
              any part of Condé Nast, you can opt to save your user name and password 
              on your computer. We can provide this convenience by placing a cookie 
              on your computer. <br>
              <br>
              Our cookies may contain personally identifiable information and 
              such cookies may be shared with our affiliated companies. <br>
              <br>
              Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. 
              We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. <br>
              <br>
              If you don't want cookies, your Web browser likely includes an option 
              that allows you to not accept them. However, if you set your browser 
              to refuse cookies, some portions of Condé Nast may not function 
              properly. <br>
              <br>
              While your individual information is protected as outlined above, 
              we reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our 
              users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage 
              trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners. <br>
              <br>
              IP ADDRESS <br>
              <br>
              Your Internet Protocol ("IP") address is usually associated with 
              the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet 
              Service Provider, your company or your university. We may use your 
              IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, gather broad 
              demographic information, and administer our website. <br>
              <br>
              <a name="kids">KIDS AND PARENTS</a> <br>
              <br>
              Condé Nast is not intended for use by children, especially those 
              under age 13. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal 
              information or use our public discussion areas, forums and chats. 
              Minors between the ages of 13 and 17 must get the permission of 
              their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) before making purchases, including 
              subscriptions, on this site. <br>
              <br>
              If your children disclose information about themselves in our public 
              discussion areas, they may get unsolicited messages from other parties. 
              Accordingly, you should tell them not to do so. <br>
              <br>
              If you're worried about your children's activities or their privacy 
              on our site, we encourage you to e-mail our Privacy Policy Coordinator 
              at privacy@Condé Nast. <br>
              <br>
              If you have other concerns or questions about any aspect of this 
              policy, you may also e-mail our Privacy Policy Coordinator. We welcome 
              your feedback. You can also send us regular mail at the following
