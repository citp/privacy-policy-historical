Constellation Energy Group has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: [www.constellationenergy.com](http://www.constellationenergy.com/).

We use your IP address to help administer our Web site. IP addresses are logged to track a user’s session. This tells us the region our site visitors come from and gives us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user’s session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.

This site contains links to other sites. [www.constellationenergy.com](http://www.constellationenergy.com/) is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

Our site may use order forms for site visitors to request information, products and services. We collect visitor’s contact information (like their email address). Contact information from the order form is used to send information about our company to our site visitors.

We will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information about our users to anyone outside of our corporate family without first receiving that user’s permission, preventing this information from appearing in unauthorized mailings and other solicitations.

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact
