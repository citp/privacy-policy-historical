Synovate. We are committed
to protecting the information you provide to us. If you have any questions or
you feel we have not addressed your concerns, please feel free to <a href="contact.htm"><b>
<font color="#FF9900">contact

<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">You can be assured that Synovate will conduct research
in a professional and ethical manner. As a member of <a href="http://www.casro.org"><b>
<font color="#FF9900">CASRO</font></b></a>
(The Council of American Survey Research Organizations), we are committed to
maintaining panelists’ privacy. Our privacy policy and Web site conform to the
Code of Standards and Ethics for Survey Research put forth by <a href="http://www.casro.org"><b>
<font color="#FF9900">CASRO</font></b></a>.</p>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">Synovate observes the following principles of behavior
regarding information privacy. Each principle is stated below, along with links
to more detailed explanations.</p>
<b>
</b><p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10"><b>Principle of Openness: </b>We practice <b><a href="#OPENNESS">
<font color="#FF9900">openness</font></a></b>
in explaining who we are and how we use information we receive. Whenever we
request personally identifiable information (e.g. name, address and other data
that identifies an individual), we clearly disclose what details are required
and how your ability to participate in our services will be impacted if you
choose not to provide such information.</p>
    <p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10"><b>Principle of Accuracy: </b>To ensure the <b><a href="#ACCURACY">
    <font color="#FF9900">accuracy</font></a></b>
of Synovate records, we will contact you periodically to confirm the
information we receive. You can also contact us to review, amend or correct such
information.</p>
    <p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10"><b>Principle of Collection: </b>We limit<b> <a href="#COLLECTION">
    <font color="#FF9900">collection</font></a></b>
of information to only those details we need for the stated purpose(s). We do
not collect personally identifiable information (e.g. name, address and other
data that identifies an individual) unless you provide it to us via our Web
site, an e-mail message, a phone call or by postal mail. Because you must be 18
years of age or older to register for participation in survey projects through
our Web site, we never target or knowingly collect personally identifiable
information directly from children. If we would like the opinions of children
who are under age 18 in your household, we will explicitly address the survey to
the adult registered panel member and ask him/her to supervise the questions to
be asked of the child. We enable members to Tell-A-Friend about participating in
    Synovate surveys but use referred e-mail addresses one time only for the
purpose of inviting their participation.</p>
    <p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10"><b>Principles of Use, Disclosure and Retention: </b>We <b><a href="#LIMIT USE">
    <font color="#FF9900">limit
use</font></a></b>, <b><a href="#LIMIT DISCLOSURE"><font color="#FF9900">disclosure</font></a></b> and <b><a href="#LIMIT RETENTION">
    <font color="#FF9900">retention</font></a></b>
of the information contained in Synovate records. Under no circumstances
will we ever disclose personally identifiable information, except when: 1) we
need to secure behavioral data from clients to compare with survey responses; 2)
we believe in good faith that the law requires it; 3) we are conducting business
with our worldwide offices, subsidiaries and affiliates; or 4) we must protect
the rights and property of Synovate. At any time, you may opt-out from
receiving survey project notifications.</p>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10"><b>Principle of Secondary Usage: </b>Synovate strictly
limits <b><a href="#SECONDARY USAGE"><font color="#FF9900">secondary usage</font></a></b> of personally
identifiable information provided to us. In addition to identifying survey
projects based on personally identifiable information, Synovate uses data
from our members in statistical modeling to better understand trends among the
general population.</p>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10"><b>Principle of Security</b>: We employ a series of <b><a href="#SECURITY">
<font color="#FF9900">security</font></a></b>
procedures to protect the information provided to us.</p>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10"><b>Principle of Compliance: </b>We continually review all
aspects of our operations to ensure <b><a href="#COMPLIANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY">
<font color="#FF9900">compliance</font></a></b>
with our stated privacy policy.</p>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10"><b>Principle of Accountability:</b>

of all actions involving our privacy policy.</p>

<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">Synovate, one of the largest marketing research
firms in America, specializes in collecting and processing information to assist
clients with strategic business decisions. For more than 50 years, we have
questioned millions of consumers like you. Our panelists have provided opinions
on everything from hair spray to refrigerators - and many other products and
services in between. Our original panel of consumers was started back in 1948 and is now one of the largest in
the world.</p>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">Through our network of offices across the U.S. and Canada,
as well as global affiliations, Synovate's primary activity is the design,
execution, and interpretation of market research conducted on behalf of clients,
which include a majority of the largest 100 multinational consumer products and
services companies.</p>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">Companies both large and small are interested in your
opinions as they strive to provide better products and services to you, their
customers. Synovate provides opportunities for our members to voice their
opinions. We have traditionally obtained opinions from our panelists through the
mail, over the telephone or at shopping malls. With the advent of computers and
the growth of the Internet, we now have an exciting new way to gather your
opinions. The Internet allows you to respond to a survey at your leisure any
time of day, any day of the week and at your own computer.</p>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">In order for us to determine which survey opportunities are
appropriate for you and your household, we need to request some personally
identifiable information (e.g. name, address and other data that identifies an
individual). When we request personally identifiable information, we clearly
disclose what details are required and how your ability to participate in our
services will be impacted if you choose not to provide such information.</p>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">Synovate headquarters are located at 3040 West Salt
Creek Lane, Arlington Heights, Illinois 60005. We can be reached by mail, by

<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">Synovate limits the information we collect for our
records to those details we need for the stated purpose(s). We will always
disclose what details are required and how your ability to participate in our
services will be impacted if you choose not to provide certain information. To
complete your registration, we need your name, geographic location and
various other types of personally identifiable information. When you respond to
survey project notifications, we may ask for additional personally identifiable
information to ensure a particular project is appropriate for you and your
household's habits, interests and preferences. This information will be
aggregated with other survey respondents.</p>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">You can browse our Web site without entering any personally
identifiable information and therefore remain anonymous during your visit.
However, we hope all of our visitors will register with us so we can make their
opinions known.</p>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">In order to participate in surveys or receive product
trials, however, registration for the panel is required.</p>
<b><i>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">Children’s Data</p>
</i></b>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">You must be 18 years of age or older to register for
participation in survey projects through our Web site. When you register, we ask
you to provide demographic information on all members of your household,
including children, for classification and survey qualification purposes only.
However, we never target or knowingly collect personally identifiable
information (e.g. name, address or other data that identifies the individual)
directly from children. If we would like the opinions of children who are under
age 18 in your household, we will explicitly address the survey to the adult
registered panel member and ask him/her to supervise the questions to be asked
of the child. The way in which the opinions of children will be used will always
be stated explicitly at the same time the question is asked and we will not
require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to
participate in an activity. You and your household's children are never
obligated to complete a survey and we will not use any games, prizes or other
activities/inducements directed at children for any purpose.</p>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">The registered panel member may at any time ask to have a
child’s information deleted, and refuse to allow further collection or use. To
do so, please:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="bullets" style="margin-left: 10">e-mail your request to <b>

Usage Tracking</p>
</i></b>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">In order to ensure our Web site is as useful as possible,
Synovate may retain details concerning visits to the Web site but will<font color="#FF3300"><b> 
NOT</b></font> compile these details with personally identifiable information. The
purpose of such activity is to collect details about all users’ activities so
we can track the number of visits to our site, how many times each page is
accessed, the paths visitors take to access various pages and other usage
details.</p>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">Whenever you provide your household ID for a survey project,
our servers document each session’s log-in, pages visited and log-out. Our
servers also record your IP address. Each time you access the Internet, your
computer is automatically assigned an IP address by your ISP (Internet Service
Provider) or network. When you visit pages on the Synovate web site, our
servers record your IP address in a log. These logs are then used for system
administration (such as site usage reporting and analysis) so we can constantly
improve the content we provide. For instance, if our tracking indicates numerous
members are accessing a particular page, we will post a special link that makes
it as easy to find as possible. We will not associate IP addresses with
personally identifiable information unless our system administrators believe it
is necessary to do so for recognizing visitors who threaten our site,
registrants, customers or others.</p>
<b><i>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">Cookies</p>
</i></b>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">At this time, Synovate employs "cookies"
(messages stored in text files on your hard drive containing details about your
visits to our web site) for the purpose of tracking particular survey sessions,
and they are made inactive when surveys are completed. If there is ever an
occasion, however, to expand the use of this technology, we will first ask for
your complete consent to do so and explain the intended use of the information
gathered.</p>
<b><i>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">Links to Other Sites</p>
</i></b>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">The Synovate web site provides links to other World Wide
Web pages that provide additional opportunities and information from third
parties. Synovate’s privacy policy cannot and does not apply to external
Web areas. Even if a business partnership or third party affiliation exists
between Synovate and the operator of a linked Web page, once you depart the
Synovate site you are subject to the linked site’s privacy policies and
procedures. Because Synovate has no control over such Web operators, you
should consult each Web site’s privacy policy before providing personally
identifying information. However, we invite you to <a href="contact.htm"><b>
<font color="#FF9900">contact
us</font></b></a> if you have concerns about privacy policies of sites linked on <a href="http://www.ConsumerOpinionPanel.com/"><b>
<font color="#FF9900">ConsumerOpinionPanel.com</font></b></a>.
We will use your feedback to determine whether to continue providing those
links.</p>
<b><i>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">Tell-A-Friend</p>
</i></b>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">Synovate provides a referral service for members to
provide names and e-mail addresses for informing friends about participating in
our survey opportunities. When members provide the necessary information, we
will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting him/her to
register. Synovate collects this information for the sole purpose of sending
this one-time e-mail. The friend’s information will not be stored and used
again unless the recipient opts-in to participate.</p>

    qualify for, based on demographics and indicated interests, and contact you

</ul>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">In addition, Synovate collects members’ survey
responses (referred to as syndicated data) to design additional survey
opportunities, but this process does not involve the disclosure of any
personally identifiable information.</p>

<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10"><a name="LIMIT DISCLOSURE">LIMIT DISCLOSURE</a></p>
</b>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">Synovate releases registrants’ general demographic
information, but this does not involve identifying any individual survey
participant. We will not disclose any personally identifiable information (e.g.
name, address and other data that identifies you) to business partners or third
parties unless you agree, in advance, that we may do so, or for one of the
reasons explained below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="bullets" style="margin-left: 10">It may occasionally be necessary for
    Synovate to
    provide survey participants’ names and addresses to clients for single-use
    matching purposes to compare actual behaviors with survey responses. The
    matching is performed by Synovate after clients provide behavioral data
    for survey participants. When these completed survey reports are presented
    to clients, participants’ names and addresses are not included with the
    results. Clients that receive survey participants' names and addresses are
    required to sign an agreement stating that the information will not be
    retained, copied or utilized in any manner other than identifying product or
    service usage history for the single-use matching purpose. These procedures
    strictly adhere to the Code of Standards and Ethics for Survey Research
    established by <a href="http://www.casro.org"><b><font color="#FF9900">CASRO</font></b></a>.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p class="bullets" style="margin-left: 10">In the course of operations to conduct market research
    surveys, Synovate may share members’ information with our various
    worldwide offices, subsidiaries and affiliates. The recipients of this
    information are bound by the same use and disclosure terms as stated in this
    policy.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p class="bullets" style="margin-left: 10">Synovate may disclose personally identifiable
    information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to
    identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who is infringing or
    misappropriating Synovate’s legal rights, or injuring or interfering
    with the property of Synovate or third parties (other individuals,
    organizations or businesses).</p></li>
  <li>
    <p class="bullets" style="margin-left: 10">We may also disclose personally identifiable information

</b>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">Whenever Synovate requests personally identifiable
information, we will state the reasons for doing so. For example, we need to
know geographic location, ages and other details in order to identify
appropriate surveys for which you and your household will later be invited to
participate.</p>
<p class="10ptbody" style="margin-left: 10">In addition to identifying survey projects based on
personally identifiable information, Synovate uses data from our members in
statistical modeling to better understand trends among the general population.
This statistical modeling helps companies identify the types of consumers who
may be interested in products and services. For instance, a company introducing
a new baby care product in grocery stores may seek to know which zip codes in a
city have the highest concentration of families with young children. When we
perform this statistical modeling, we never release names or other personally
