### 1\. Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy last updated: 10/4/17

ConnectYourCare recognizes itsobligation to protect the personal information you share via this website. We are committed to protecting your online privacy while providing you with the most useful Internet experience possible.

**Information Collection and Use**

To conduct our business, we may collect personal information about you from applications or other forms, health plans and providers, your employer and our partners. In some circumstances, you may provide us with additional information yourself. We will not share this information with others using methods different than the methods described in this Privacy Policy.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

We may use and disclose information collected to affiliated third parties with which we contract for services, including your employer, to administer the program, evaluate and enhance the programs we offer and for certain other purposes as permitted by law. We will use or share only the minimum amount of personal information needed for a particular purpose. These parties are not permitted to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. We contractually require affiliated third parties to protect your information. We do not share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties or for reasons unrelated to the servicing of this program. We do not sell or rent any personal information collected whatsoever.

**Confidentiality**

Our policies limit access to personal user information that is collected from this website to our employees and agents and the employees and/or agents of our affiliates and business partners who need the information to fulfill their business responsibilities. We may disclose personal information collected online to our affiliates and to vendors who assist us with the services. In some cases, this may require your information to be sent to other countries. By supplying your information on this web site, you consent to your information being transferred across international borders to ConnectYourCare and our affiliates, vendors, or agents, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. Vendors and other outside contractors we engage are subject to our contractual requirements for safeguarding personal information.

Employees and others with duties related to this website must adhere to this Privacy Policy and End User Terms of Use.  Our employees receive annual training about the privacy policies and procedures of ConnectYourCare and its affiliates and subsidiaries.

To comply with applicable laws and regulations, we record your IP addresses and login credentials when you access our site. The application logs all transaction-based activity regarding the date, time and user performing the transaction. Furthermore, changes to system configurations are logged for audit and quality control purposes. Our solution supports configurable logging levels.

**Links to Partner Sites**

This site contains links to other sites. We do not share any information with our partners unless it is necessary for the performance of a service. We cannot guarantee, though, that links to sites we don’t own or control have the same privacy practices, and we cannot assume responsibility for information our partners gather themselves. Be sure to read our partners’ privacy policies once you leave our website.

**Security Safeguards**

We use extensive physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to make sure your personal information is secure. We restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need to know that information to service this program or to properly conduct our business. All employees are trained on our security and privacy practices. We maintain safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect your information.

It is our policy to send and receive personal information through encrypted channels only. All personal data used on this web site is processed using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption.

We will use or share only the minimum amount of personal health information or personally identifiable information needed for a particular purpose. We will continue to limit disclosures of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy even after your relationship with us ends.

**Communications You May Receive**

We will send you service-related announcements on those occasions when it is necessary to do so. We may contact you to provide information about treatment alternatives or other health-related benefits and services that may be of interest to you. Your employer may opt-out of receiving these types of communications. Please see our opt-out statement below.

**Opt-in/Opt-out Choices**

The employer has the option to turn on or off communication templates for their participant population as a whole.

Additionally, there are a few communication types that participants may control. For example, participants may elect to receive push notices sent through mobile text messaging. The participant may change these preferences at any time.

We offer three options for receiving participant statements. The employer may choose whether participants receive paper statements, eStatements, or paper statements with eStatements. Employers may also allow participants to choose between paper and eStatements. Participants are automatically enrolled in paper statements but can opt into eStatements online.

**Surveys**

We request information from users through conducting surveys semiannually. Participation in these surveys is voluntary. Survey information is used for product development and to improve the use and satisfaction of our website.

**Updating Personal Information**

If your personally identifiable information changes, you can update personal information that is provided to us by calling _(877) 292-4040_. Your personal information can also be updated through data provided to us from your employer.

**Data Retention**

We retain personal information necessary to provide you services. If you request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, your employer must contact their designated client services manager, who will coordinate the removal of said data. We will retain and use your personal information as required to fulfill our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**Privacy Complaints**

If you feel we are not following state policy, contact customer service at _(877) 292-4040_ , your state or local consumer protection office or the Better Business Bureau.

**Notification of Changes**

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy. When changes are made to our Privacy Policy, we will post notice of change to our homepage, or other places we deem appropriate. We will also update the Privacy Policy version date located at the top of this Privacy Policy.

**Legal Disclaimer**

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/ or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us or on our website, as well as for the other reasons herein mentioned.

ConnectYourCare’s data is highly confidential, and therefore data should only be shared with parties external to ConnectYourCare for business purposes. Users must make every reasonable effort to maintain the confidentiality of all ConnectYourCare customer and confidential data. It is against ConnectYourCare policy to disclose any of ConnectYourCare’s customer data without the express prior written consent by the customer. Users must not publicly disclose ConnectYourCare or customer information that may adversely affect ConnectYourCare’s reputation, customer relations, or public image. Finally, ConnectYourCare and its employees will respect and protect the privacy of confidential data in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards.
