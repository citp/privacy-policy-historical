Connectify (“Connectify,” “we,” “us”) respects your privacy, including the privacy of your information and your pictures. This Privacy Policy explains the type of information we collect through our website at www.connectify.com (the “Site”) and our Connectify software, and how we use this information to provide outstanding service to you.

By accessing and using the Site or other software or services owned or operated by Connectify (collectively, the “Services”), you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Services.

If you feel that Connectify is not abiding by this Privacy Policy, you should contact us at support@connectify.me and we will do our best to resolve your inquiry.

1\. What Information does Connectify collect?

We collect information from you when you register for the Services, including when you place an order, communicate with our staff, or subscribe to our mailing list. As appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, or credit card information.

Connectify also collects non-personally identifiable information about how visitors use our web site; for example, Connectify utilizes web analytics software to track, in aggregate, the number of unique views received by the pages of the web site, the domains from which users originate along with many other analytical data points.  The Connectify website may use “cookies,” clear GIFs, or similar technologies to track how users engage with our website.  A cookie is a small data file that is placed on your computer’s hard drive by a web server when you visit a web site; each time you visit the website, your web browser sends information from the cookie back to the web server to facilitate identification of users or site visitors and to keep track of other information such as the date and time of your visit.  Consult the “Help” portion of your browser toolbar for information on how to control or disable cookies.  Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded on web pages and may not be disabled or controlled through your browser.

2\. What Does Connectify Use This Information For?

We use this information to process and verify transactions and orders, perform and improve customer service, and to send periodic communications to our customers.  For example, we may use the email address you provide to us to send you information pertaining to your order.  We may also send you information about Connectify, related products or services, important notifications regarding your subscriptions or account, and other related information.  Historically, these have been quite rare as we respect your time as well as your privacy.

However, if at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails concerning offers, promotions, or other information related to marketing, you may do so from the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of our emails.  Due to the nature of the Services, we must reserve the right to send you certain other non-marketing communications related to the Services with Connectify including via email.  We pledge to keep these limited to those communications that we feel are absolutely necessary, such as emergency notifications concerning the Services.

3\. Does Connectify Disclose Information to Outside Parties?

We will not sell or rent your personal information to any outside company.   Except as described below, we will not disclose your personal information to outside parties.

  * Third Party Service Providers.  We may share aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about users with outside parties.  It may be necessary, at times, to share certain personal information with trusted third parties who assist us in conducting our business or providing our services.  These companies are authorized to use information only as necessary to provide services to us.
  * Law Enforcement; Emergencies; Compliance. Connectify may disclose personal information in the following situations as we believe to be appropriate, even though you might have requested that we not share your information: (i) under applicable law; (ii) to comply with legal process; (iii) to respond to governmental requests, including requests from law enforcement and regulatory authorities; (iv) to enforce our terms and conditions; (v) to protect our operations; (vi) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Connectify, you, or others; and (vii) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.  For example, we may, to the fullest extent the law allows, disclose personal information to law enforcement agencies and regulatory authorities to assist them in identifying individuals who have been or may be engaged in unlawful activities.
  * Assignment. We reserve the right to transfer personal information to a new entity or third party as part of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of some or all of our assets, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). We will notify you via email or prominent notice on our web site if the third party’s or new entity’s treatment of personal information will materially differ from the treatment described in this Privacy Policy; this notice will be provided at least thirty (30) days before such material changes take effect.
