### Commitment to Privacy

As a security software producer, CONNECTIFY knows that you care about how your information is used and shared. We respect your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the use of your information is important to us. We want to make sure that you understand the type of information we collect about you, how it is used and the safeguards we use to protect it. This Privacy Policy explains our policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information you share with us. 

### What Information Does CONNECTIFY Collect?

The type of information that we collect and retain depends upon your interaction with our Site. Here is a short overview of the two main types of interactions. 

  1. Information You Give Us. We collect the personally identifiable information you provide to us on our Site, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, and if you pay by credit card, your account information when you:
    * Create a user account, place an order, register a product (information we collect is necessary to complete the transaction and so that we can keep you informed about CONNECTIFY products and services, such as your name, last name, e-mail address, and country).
    * Requesting product support or other services (information we collect is necessary to, provide support and to respond to queries such as your name and address and information about your computer hardware, software (including your License Number), and the nature of the problem you are experiencing)
    * Participate in surveys (information we collect may include demographic information such as age, gender and number of household members)

You have the final decision on whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal information. However, if you do not wish to provide information needed for a transaction, you may not be able to complete it. 

  2. Information Collected and Stored Automatically. When you interact with CONNECTIFY we may maintain a record of the following types of information.
    * Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address or other technical information such as a referring web site, if any, and the path you take through CONNECTIFY Sites when you visit us online.
    * The date and time, the internet address of the website from which you link directly to our website.
    * The name of the file or the words you search, and the browser you use to access our website.



The information collected and stored automatically by our Site is used to measure the number of visitors to various sections of our Site and to identify system performance or for server issues. We also use this information to help us expand the coverage of our Site and to make our Site more useful. This information is not linked by us to personally identifiable information and we do not disclose this in a form that personally identifies you, except in cases where we must provide IP addresses to certain credit card processors in connection with the processing of your credit card transaction. You may want to contact your credit card provider with any questions regarding the transactional information they require. 

### Do We Use Cookies?

“Cookies” are small pieces of unique information, sent by a website, that are stored on your computer’s hard drive by your web browser. Cookies enable a website to tailor information presented to you based on your browsing preferences. CONNECTIFY uses cookies to personalize your pages at our Site, when you seek service & support or to remember you when you register for products or services. CONNECTIFY may also use cookies to track your visit to our Site. While our web servers may automatically log your IP address, the type of information we collect pertains to how you navigate, browse and purchase on our Site. This information is not personally identifiable, and we do not correlate this information with your personal information. 

If you do not want us to store this information or if you are using a public computer, the “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable cookies altogether. However, rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use some of the products and/or services at our Site.

Under certain circumstances and from time to time, CONNECTIFY may share your personally identifiable information with third parties as set forth below. In such circumstances, we provide only the information necessary to perform the function or to provide the service for which it has been shared. These third parties are required to keep the information confidential and are not permitted to use the personal information provided by us for any purpose, except as authorized by CONNECTIFY. 

CONNECTIFY may share your information with third parties such as:

Examples include providers who fulfill orders, ship products, process transactions (including credit card transactions), distribute e-mails, conduct research or statistical analysis or provide other marketing assistance. It may be necessary to share user personal information with these service providers in order to allow them to provide their services. You have the right not to provide the requested information, but in such case you may not be able to receive these services. Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service and we require that they keep the personal information of our customers secure and confidential and comply with the Act and all other applicable laws. We also require that these contractors use our customers’ personal information only on behalf of CONNECTIFY and do not disclose them to third parties or use them for any other purpose.

We restrict access to personal information about you to those CONNECTIFY employees who need to know the information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. 

Unfortunately, no transmission of information over the internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to our Site from your PC or the Internet Service Provider, and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to ensure its security on our system and to try to prevent unauthorized access.
