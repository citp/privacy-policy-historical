# ConceptDraw Personal Privacy Policy

CS Odessa has established this Personal Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.

Personal Information implies any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. Generally, you can visit CS Odessa Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.

Information you provide will be used by CS Odessa to ensure all customers and persons interested in our products receive individual attention and service they deserve. To the extent necessary to process your order, we will forward your information to on-site authorized CS Odessa sales partners, who will use this information solely for order fulfillment, e.g. to ship your order. Should you refuse us to do so, please let us know by sending an e-mail to:   


This statement set out our privacy policies and practices in relation to the following:

  * What information is collected
  * How the information is used
  * With whom the information is shared
  * How you access or change your personal identifiable information



Please be advised that this text is for information purposes only and does not imply or construe any consent on your part.

### Site-Visit Statistics

As you browse our web site, information is automatically collected on the time of the visit, pages viewed, downloads made as well as similar interactions to hold market research and help improve our Internet content and service. This type of data collection is made anonymously. Even during subsequent processing and evaluation, this data is never linked in any way to our customer databank.

Processing this information does not constitute an invasion of personal privacy, since it pertains or relates in no way to specific individuals or users. This activity does not fall within the scope of data and privacy-protection laws and regulations.

### News

Your e-mail address is always stored once you subscribe to our news. We do not share this information with anyone.

Should you voluntarily provide additional information when subscribing to news, our authorization to use and share this data will be restricted to the respective individual consent you grant us.

If you no longer want to receive our news or product updates, you can remove your e-mail address from our mailing list by clicking on the automatic "unsubscribe" link in any of our mailings, by entering your e-mail address on this unsubscribe page, or by simply e-mailing us at:

We also reserve the right to share this data within our group of partners/local resellers. Otherwise, we do not share this information with anyone.

Beyond this, our authorization to use and share this data will be restricted to the respective individual consent you grant us.

### Electronic product registration

When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your registration information with any information you've already left with us (we call that information your personal profile).

### Surveys & Contests

From time to time we also collect information via surveys. Participation in these surveys is on voluntary basis only. You may choose whether or not to participate and thereby disclose any information about yourself.

The Information requested may include contacts (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such education level, and job function). Survey information will be used only for purposes of improving the use and customer satisfaction of this site.

### Security

We use reasonable precautions to protect our customers' personal information and to store it securely. Sensitive information transmitted to us online (such as credit card number) is encrypted and is transmitted to us securely. In addition, access to all of our customers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted. Only authorized employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

### Your California Privacy rights
