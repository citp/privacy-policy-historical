What Does This Privacy Policy Cover? 

This Privacy Policy covers Company’s treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Company gathers when you access the Website and when you use Company’s services.  This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage. 

What Personal Information Does Company Collect? 

The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers: 

**Personal Information You Provide to Us: **

We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way.  The types of Personal Information which may be collected include your full name, email address, mobile phone number, credit card and/or other payment information, username, password and any other information necessary for us to provide our services.  You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but in some cases you may not then be able to take advantage of many of our special features.  The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, sending product updates, and communicating with you about Company’s products and services, including specials and new features. 

**Other Information Collected Automatically: **

·       We receive and store certain other types of information that are not Personal Information whenever you interact with our Website or use our services.  For example, Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. 

·       Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components or users of our services, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show.  Company only uses this data in aggregate or anonymous form and not in a manner that would identify you personally.  This type of aggregate or anonymous data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website and services appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services.  As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate or anonymous information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Website or services.  We share this type of data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. 

**E-mail Communications: **

We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Company if your computer supports this type of program. Company uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful.  We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.  When you receive e-mail from Company, you can opt out of receiving further e-mails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe. 

**What About Cookies? **

·       Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people.  We use cookies to enhance visitors’ experiences, to learn more about their use of the Website and to improve quality.
