<ol>
<li>What personally identifiable information of yours is collected through the Site; 
</li><li>Who collects such information;

<h2>What Information We Collect and How We Use That Information</h2>
<p>Our registration forms require users to give us contact information that may include name, email address, format preference (HTML vs. Text), address, interests, and similar information. We do not request or store sensitive information from our visitors such as credit card or social security numbers. We use customer contact information from the registration forms to send the user requested information about our company. We never sell, share or trade any of our customer information with other companies. </p>

<p>Convio is the sole owner of the information collected on the Site. This Site does not collect personally identifying information about users except when you specifically and knowingly provide it. For example, we collect information from you in the following ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>Some areas of our Site request or require contact and other information. 
</li><li>During the registration process, we collect personal and other information such as your name, address, and email address. 
</li><li>Demographic and profile data (e.g., age, gender and income level) may also be collected at our Site. We use such data to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site's content, layout, and services. </li></ul>
<p>Additionally, this data may be shared with advertisers or other third parties solely on an aggregated basis. We do not share any personally identifying information with any third party without your consent, except to a court or governmental agency if required by law. </p>
<h2>Internet Protocol Address</h2>
<p>We collect an IP address from all visitors to our Site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, analyze trends, track users' movement, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the Site, and deliver customized, personalized content. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
<h2>Information from Children</h2>
<p>Our Site is for adults and usage by children is not intended. We make efforts to verify the age of our users in order to avoid collecting personal information from children, and do not seek to collect personal information about children through our Site. If a child submits information to us through any part of our Site, and we know that the user submitting the information is a child, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties. </p>
