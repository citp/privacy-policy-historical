### PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

**Information you provide directly.** We collect and store personal information that you directly provide us through our Site, when using our Products, and other ways, such as through a customer support request, through interactions on social media, participation in a survey or promotion, application for a job, when downloading white papers on our Sites, and at events. Information we collect includes, for example, your name, job title, company name, email address, phone number, mailing address, billing address, city and country, and any data you enter into any ‘free text’ boxes on our forms. We may collect credit card numbers and other payment information if you purchase Products, such as online training, cloud services, or software subscriptions.

**Information collected automatically.** As further described in the “Our Use of Cookies and Other Technologies” and “Product telemetry data” sections below, we and our third-party partners automatically collect certain types of usage information when you use our Sites or Products. For example, when you visit our Site, your device’s operating system, device identifier and other device information, user agent string, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type, and log data detailing your interactions with our Site (e.g., number of clicks, pages viewed, information searched for), and the website you visited before and after coming to our Site (i.e., referrer header) are logged automatically. When you submit a support ticket, we receive data from the user agent string of your browser, which includes device information, browser information, OS information, city, state, country, and IP address.

**Product telemetry data.** When you use our Products, we may also collect certain telemetry data and other data about your usage, including your IP Address and other unique identifiers in combination with information about the version of our software you are running and how it is configured, to collect and aggregate certain diagnostic and analytics information. We may combine this information with information you provide when you download our Products or provide to customer support, including the name of your organization or company. You can turn off the collection of telemetry data as described in the “Choices” section below and as described further in the applicable product documentation.

When we collect IP addresses through Control Center, KSQL, or Proactive Support, we take appropriate steps to pseudonymise the IP addresses before it is stored. We employ technical and organizational measures to prevent the reconstitution of IP addresses or reversal of pseudonymization that would allow attribution of the data to a specific individual, including segregating or not collecting any additional information that may be used for attribution. We store the pseudonymized data for 2 years.  
The resulting pseudonymised data is used by us on behalf of our customers to (i) maintain and improve Control Center, Confluent Enterprise, and KSQL, and (ii) inform users whether they are running the latest version of KSQL.

Confluent Enterprise customers may choose to enable collection of more information about the Kafka broker and report it to Confluent by setting `confluent.support.customer.id’ to their assigned customer ID in the broker configuration and restarting the broker. The additional information includes bytes written to the broker, bytes read from the broker, incoming and outgoing bytes rate, number of topics and partitions in the cluster, broker configuration with some fields filtered out (such as SSL related configs, host name, etc.). This additional data is used by us to improve customer support and reduce time to support ticket resolution.

To find out more detailed information about our collection practices with respect to Control Center, KSQL, and Proactive Support please [click here](https://www.confluent.io/moreinformation/).

**Information collected through social media and other platforms.** We receive information about you when you engage with us through various third-party platforms, for example, by joining our Slack community or Google group, liking us on Facebook, connecting on LinkedIn, GitHub, or Meetup, following us on Twitter or Instagram, registering for training through WooCommerce, or sharing content from our Site on Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. The data we exchange with these third-party platforms may depend upon your privacy settings with these platforms. You should review and consider adjusting your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before engaging. Do not provide us with any sensitive personal data through these platforms. We are not responsible for the data protection and use practices of these third-party platforms. Please see their privacy statements to learn how they use your information.

**Third-party sources.** We may occasionally receive your personal information from third party sources including our affiliates, marketing and research partners, and companies such as DiscoverOrg (contact database), Hootsuite (social media management platform), Kickfire (company database), and LinkedIn. Users of our Products may also provide your personal information when they identify you as a billing, support, or technical contact, or when inviting you to use our Products or attend our events. If you integrate or link a third-party service with our Sites or Products we may receive personal information about you from that third-party service based upon the settings and permissions you’ve established with such third party service, and that third party service’s privacy practices.

The types of information we collect from third parties may include name, company name, title, role, zip code, city, country, telephone number, and social media engagement. We use this information to maintain and improve the accuracy of the records we hold about you, identify new customers, and provide a more tailored advertising experience. We may combine this information with other information we collect about you through our Sites and Products.

When you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline. But if you choose not to provide information that is necessary to provide certain Products, those Products may not be available or function correctly.

### HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION

**Storage and processing.** Your information collected through the Sites and our Products may be stored and processed in any country in which Confluent or its subsidiaries, affiliates, or service providers maintain facilities including your region, the United States, Australia, Canada, and the European Economic Area (including the United Kingdom). Our processing locations are chosen in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in order to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem. We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this Privacy Statement is processed according to the provisions of this Privacy Statement and applicable law wherever the data is located.

**International data transfers.  **When we transfer personal information from the European Economic Area (including the United Kingdom) and from Switzerland to the United States or other countries which have not been determined by the European Commission to have laws that provide an adequate level of data protection, we use legal mechanisms, including contracts, designed to help ensure your rights and protections. Specifically, our website servers are located in the United States and our affiliates, partners, third parties and service providers operate in the United States, European Economic Area, Canada, and Australia. This means when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries. However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement. The safeguard Confluent primarily relies upon is the European Commission-approved standard contractual data protection clauses. For more information about these mechanisms, please contact us using the contact details provided in the “How to contact us” section below.

**Keeping your information safe.** Confluent cares about the security of your information and takes reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction of personal information. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems or your information.

**Lawful basis for processing personal information (EEA only).** If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), Confluent, Inc, is the data controller of your information.

Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will indicate this at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences, if any, if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), we will indicate to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you have questions about the legal basis for processing or want to find out more please contact us using the details at the end of this Privacy Statement.

**Retention**. We retain personal information for as long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. For example, we retain your account information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with Products you have requested or authorized, including maintaining and improving the performance of the Products and protecting system security. We also retain personal data as needed to maintain appropriate business and financial records, protect our legal interests, resolve disputes, or comply with legal or regulatory requirements. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will store your personal information using appropriate security measures and take appropriate steps designed to isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.  


### EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS

If the processing of personal data about you is subject to European Union data protection law, you have certain rights with respect to that data:

  * You may request access to, and correction or erasure of, personal information.
  * If automated processing of your personal data is based on a contract with you or your consent, you have certain rights to data portability.
  * If the processing of personal information is based on your consent, you have a right to withdraw consent at any time for future processing.
  * You have a right to object to, or obtain a restriction of, the processing of personal information under certain circumstances.



To make such requests, contact us by email at the address below.  You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, but we encourage you to first contact us with any questions or concerns.  


### CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY STATEMENT

Confluent may modify or update this Privacy Statement from time to time to reflect the changes in our business and practices, and so you should review this page periodically.  If we make any changes to this Privacy Statement, we will notify you by changing the “Last Updated” date above.  If we make any material changes, we will provide you with additional notice or obtain consent as may be required by applicable law.
