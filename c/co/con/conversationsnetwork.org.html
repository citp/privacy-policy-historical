    Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="storycontent">
    	<p>The personal privacy of Internet users is extremely important to The Conversations Network and we recognize and support the protection of visitors' privacy rights as a fundamental principle of our business.<br>
</p><h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
	<p>The Conversations Network does not sell, share, or rent email addresses, mailing lists or any other personal information. We will not sell, share,              or rent this information to others in ways different from what is              disclosed in this statement.</p>
	<h3>Clickthroughs</h3>
	<p>In the process of delivering web pages and email, The Conversations Network              recognizes any URLs that are clicked and may record some information              supplied by your computer, such as the type of browser, operating              system and IP address. </p>
	<h3>Cookies</h3>
	<p>A cookie is a small amount of data, optionally stored on a visitor's              hard drive, containing information that is placed there by a website.              This information is often used to identify successive visits by the              same web browser to the same site, or to remember information between              sessions on the website. The Conversations Network uses two types of cookies:              First, if you check the Remember Me box on the Register              or Login pages              we will save an encrypted version of your login information as a cookie              on your computer. This will allow you or anyone using your computer              to bypass the login process on subsequent visits. Second, we will use a temporary cookie (one that              will disappear as soon as you close your browser) to make our site              easier to use by rembering your preferences from one page to another.              Some of our advertisers also use cookies and may track your usage              patterns in ways beyond our control.</p>
	<h3>Log Files</h3>
	<p>We may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our service,              track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for              aggregate use.</p>
	<h3>Tracking Pixels</h3>
	<p>Tracking pixels (also known as "web bugs") are small, typically              transparent images on a web page or in email that have special names              which permit the loading of the web page to be tracked by a web server. The Conversations Network uses tracking pixels on our web site and in HTML              email we send to detect when the email is opened. </p>
	<h3>Sharing</h3>
	<p>We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners.              Shared aggregated information is not linked to any information about              any individual person.</p>
	<h3>Links</h3>
	<p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that The Conversations Network is not responsible for the privacy practices of other              sites. We encourage our users to be aware of when they leave our site              and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that              collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement              applies solely to information collected, and services provided, by              our web site.</p>
	<h3>Email</h3>
	<p>From time to time we may offer users the opportunity to subscribe              to one of our mailing lists. If a user wishes to subscribe to a list,              we ask for contact information such as name and email address. We              send e-mail messages only to those who have opted-in for particular              purposes such as to be informed of new programs on our site. </p>
	<h3>Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE) Policy</h3>
	<p>The Conversations Network does not send "spam." The term "spam"              refers to emailing a message to address(es) that have not asked to              receive it. In addition, every message sent by The Conversations Network provides              information about unsubscribing from (that is, choosing not to receive)              future mailings. Every email message The Conversations Network sends contains              instructions that allow you unsubscribe from our list(s). To contact The Conversations Network to request removal from future The Conversations Network email              communications, you can send email to webmaster@conversationsnetwork.org specifying the address that you wish to unsubscribe, or send mail              to the US postal address:</p>
	<blockquote><p>The Conversations Network <br>               113 Terrace Avenue<br>               Kentfield, CA 94904 (US)<br>               or call +1 415.453.1400</p></blockquote>
	<h3>Forms and Surveys</h3>
	<p>From time to time we may request information from users via forms              or surveys. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely              voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose              this information. Information requested may include contact information              (such as name and email address), and demographic information (such              as zip code and profession). Survey information will be used for purposes              of monitoring or improving this site and our services. Users of our              website are notified on the website when their information is being              collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make              an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services              that require an outside party. </p>
	<h3>Security</h3>
	<p>This website (www.conversationsnetwork.org) does not collect highly sensitive              information (such as credit card numbers or Social Security numbers)              from our users. If you receive email requesting any such information,              please report it immediately to webmaster@conversationsnetwork.org.</p>
	<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
	<p>If we materially change our privacy policy, we will post a notice              on our web site's homepage so our users are always aware of what information              we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose              it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information              in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected,              we will notify registered users via email. Users will have a choice              as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.              We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under              which the information was collected.</p>
	<p>You can review the most current version of the Privacy Policy at              any time by clicking the Privacy Policy link on The Conversations Network website. If you have any questions about this Privacy              Policy, please contact webmaster@conversationsnetwork.org.</p>
