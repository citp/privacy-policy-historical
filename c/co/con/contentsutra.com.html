								<p><strong>CONTENTNEXT MEDIA, INC -&nbsp; PRIVACY POLICY EFFECTIVE DATE: April 1, 2009</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

<p><em>1.1. PURPOSE OF POLICY. </em><br>
ContentNext Media, Inc. is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the Company Website (the “Site”). We created this Website Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) to give you confidence as you visit and use the Site, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy.&nbsp; By accessing this Site, you agree to be bound by the Policy.&nbsp; If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use this Site.&nbsp; Each time you use the Site, the current version of the Policy will apply.&nbsp; Accordingly, when you use the Site, you should check the date of this Policy (which appears at the top of the page) and review any changes since the last version.</p>

<p><em>1.2. NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN</em><br>
PLEASE NOTE: We are a general audience site, and do not direct any of our content specifically at children under 18 years of age.&nbsp; If you are under the age of 18, please do not provide us with personally identifiable information of any kind whatsoever.&nbsp;  We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children’s privacy online. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a Site user is under age 18, we will promptly delete any personal information in that user’s account.&nbsp; We understand that children may not fully understand all of the provisions of this Policy or make informed decisions about the choices that are made available to adult users of the Site.&nbsp; We encourage parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be familiar with the sites their children visit.&nbsp; In order to comply with applicable federal law, we will never request personally identifiable information from anyone whom we know to be under the age of thirteen (13) without verifiable parental consent. If we become aware or have reason to suspect that a user is under the age of thirteen (13) and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>2. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</strong></p>

<p><em>2.1. WHAT BASIC INFORMATION DOES THE COMPANY COLLECT?</em><br>
In operating the Site, Company may include registration, online surveys, and other online forms that ask users to provide their names, e-mail addresses, and other contact information, as well as the following categories of information, including, but not limited to age, sex (Male/Female), household income, business type, and business region, </p>

<p><em>2.2. WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT?</em><br>
&nbsp;  &nbsp; (a) AUTOMATIC COLLECTION. Our servers automatically recognize visitors’ domain names and IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet). No personal information about you is revealed in this process. The Site may also gather anonymous “traffic data” that does not personally identify you, but that may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp; (b) COOKIES. From time to time, we may use the standard “cookies” feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on your computer about your visit to our Web site. We do not set any personally identifiable information in cookies, nor do we employ any data capture mechanisms on our website other than cookies. Cookies help us learn which areas of our site are useful and which areas need improvement. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience at our Web site may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended.</p>

<p><strong>3. USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p><em>3.1. WHAT DOES COMPANY DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION?</em><br>
&nbsp;  &nbsp; (a) PERSONAL INFORMATION. We may share registered members’ personally identifiable information collected during the Site’s registration process with third party service providers for purposes of verifying your identity, checking your qualifications, or following up with transactions you initiate on the Site. These third party service providers are not authorized to retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any purpose other than that for which such party was engaged. We may also use your contact information to inform you of any changes to the Site, offers regarding ContentNext events or products, or to send you additional information about Company.&nbsp; If you give your permission during the account registration process, we may share, rent, sell or disclose registered members personally identifiable information collected during the Site’s registration process with our business partners or other companies so that they may send you their own marketing or promotional materials.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp; (b) ANONYMOUS INFORMATION. We use anonymous information to analyze our Site traffic, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information. In addition, we may use anonymous IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our site, or to display the content according to your preferences. Traffic and transaction information may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp; (c) USE OF COOKIES. We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, or for other purposes. Promotions or advertisements displayed on our site may contain cookies. We do not have access to or control over information collected by outside advertisers on our site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp; (d) DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Company or its parent company, subsidiaries or affiliates, (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Company or the users of the Site, or (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the safety of the public or users of the Site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp; (e) SALE OF INFORMATION. In order to accommodate changes in our business, we may sell or buy portions of our company or other companies or assets, including the information collected through this Site.
