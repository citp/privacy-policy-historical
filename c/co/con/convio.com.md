By visiting our Sites or submitting information to us, you consent to the uses and disclosures listed above. 

_**Internet Protocol Address**_  
IP addresses are collected from all computers that visit our Sites. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Sites, analyze trends, track Site visitors’ movements, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the Sites, and deliver customized, personalized content. IP addresses are not linked to Personal Data. 

_**Information from Children**_  
Our Sites are directed to adults and usage by children is not intended. We do not seek to collect Personal Data about children through our Sites. If a child submits Personal Data to us on one or more of our Sites, and we know that the individual submitting the information is a child, we delete such information. 

_**Use of "Cookies"**_  
Our Sites may use cookies to enhance your experience while using our Sites. Cookies are pieces of information that can be transferred by a website to computers browsing that website. Cookies are generally used for record-keeping and analytical purposes. Cookies can make Web surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving passwords, saving personal preferences regarding use of a particular website and ensuring that the same advertisement does not appear repeatedly. Many people consider the use of cookies to be an industry standard. 

Your browser might be set to accept cookies. If you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter a setting on your browser to block cookies. If you choose to do so, though, please be aware that some areas of our Sites may not function properly when you view them. 

If you access our Sites from the EU, you should be aware that the EU e-Privacy Directive was recently revised so that users of a website must now consent to some cookies being placed on their computers. The law is evolving in this area, and browser manufacturers are working on enhanced browser settings. In the meantime, Convio is exploring methods of obtaining consent to certain cookies, such as through pop-up notices and/or its Terms of Service.

### Choice/Opt-Out

Convio provides its Clients and prospective clients with the opportunity to [opt-out](http://subscription.convio.com/) of receiving communications from us at any time. If we have contacted you via email and you no longer wish to receive promotional emails from us, you can click on the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of our emails and follow the instructions.

For information about how we handle data collected by our Clients, please see “Convio Privacy Policy for Data Collected By Our Clients.”

### Corrections/Updates

If you believe that your Personal Data is in our possession, you can always modify or delete it. To make any such changes, email us at [privacy@convio.com](mailto:privacy@convio.com). We will respond to your access request within 30 days. 

We reserve the right to maintain information about individuals who have violated our Terms of Use or who have had their access to one or more of our Sites blocked.

### Surveys

We may conduct occasional online surveys via our website or via an email newsletter. These surveys are entirely voluntary and recipients may easily decline to participate.

### Other Websites

Our Sites may contain links to other websites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are visiting another website for which Convio has no responsibility. We encourage you to read the privacy policies on all such sites as their policies may be different than ours.

### Security

Financial Data transmitted through Convio’s system is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets a Web browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before it is sent to us. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage is 100% secure. Since no data security measures are 100% foolproof, Convio cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted or stored via our software and systems.

### Data Integrity

As explained above, if Convio receives Personal Data, it processes it in a way that is compatible with and relevant to the purposes for which it was collected. Convio also takes reasonable steps to ensure that Client and Website Data is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.

### Limitations 

As set out in the Principles, our adherence to the Principles may be limited to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest, or law enforcement requirements.

### Enforcement

Convio uses a self-assessment approach to assure compliance with this Policy and periodically verifies that the policy is accurate, prominently displayed, completely implemented and accessible. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns by contacting us (see contact information below). We will attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding our uses and disclosures of Personal Data. If a complaint or dispute regarding our handling of Personal Data cannot be resolved through our internal processes, we agree to dispute resolution using [TRUSTe](http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint). 

Convio participates in the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce. As part of our participation in the Safe Harbor Framework, we have agreed to the [TRUSTe Dispute Resolution Requirements](http://www.truste.com/why_TRUSTe_privacy_services/online-privacy-watchdog.html) for disputes relating to our compliance with such Framework. If you have complaints regarding our compliance with the Safe Harbor you should first contact us at [privacy@convio.com](mailto:privacy@convio.com). If contacting us does not resolve your complaint, you may raise your complaint by contacting [TRUSTe](http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint) by fax at 415-520-3420, or mail at Watchdog Complaints, TRUSTe, 55 2nd Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA, USA 94105. 

If you are faxing or mailing TRUSTe to lodge a complaint, you must include the following information: the name of the company related to your complaint, the alleged privacy violation, your contact information, and whether you would like the particulars of your complaint shared with the company.
