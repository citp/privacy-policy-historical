**Information in General**  
“Personal Information” is information about you that is personally identifiable to you like your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number. “Anonymous Information” means information that does not permit the identification of individual persons.

I **nformation Related To Data Processed For Our Customers**  
_Service provider collection and use_  
We collect information under the direction of users of the Services and have no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data we process.

_Choice_  
We process information on behalf of users of the Services, if your data is in the possession of one of the users of the Service and you would no longer like to have your information possessed by the user of the Service, please contact the user of the Service directly.

_Service providers and onward transfer_  
We may transfer your information, including Personal Information, to third parties that help us provide our Services, including without limitation, service providers of hosting, credit card processing, support, and email services. Transfers to these third parties are covered by the provisions in this Privacy Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with those third parties.

_Access to data controlled by our customers_  
Conga has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes on behalf of our customers. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the Conga’s customer (the data controller).

**How We Gather Information**  
We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through our Website or Services.

We collect the Personal Information you provide when signing up for a demonstration or for the Conga Challenge on our Website, or for a 30-day trial of our Services, including first and last name, email address, and phone number.

With any use of our Services, whether free trial or paid subscription, salesforce.com user details for each user (“User Details”) and organization profile details are recorded in our salesforce.com instance. This includes some Personal Information from the User Details page in salesforce.com (Setup > My Personal Information > Personal Information), such as salesforce.com username, the user’s surname, family name, email address. We use this information to manage access to the Services and to provide you with technical support. We do not and will not share this information with anyone except as may be required by law or as otherwise outlined in this Privacy Policy.

Additionally, in some instances, when you purchase Services from us, we request certain Personal Information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address) and if paying by credit card, you need to provide our trusted third-party credit card processor with certain details (such as credit card number, and expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your order. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.  

If you request customer support services for Services, we may collect Personal Information to enable us to provide such customer support services to you, such as your name, email address and phone number.

If you register on the Website for a Conga webinar or participate in a web-based meeting (e.g., through GoToMeeting) for demonstration or support purposes, or make use of our Knowledgebase or community forum support features, you will need to provide the information required by the third party vendor hosting the webinar or web-based meeting, or support features. In these cases, your data will be subject to the third party vendor’s privacy policies.

Conga may occasionally provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our Website. If you participate, we may request certain Personal Information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code). We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers. This information does not identify individual users.

**Log Files**  
As is true of most web sites and on demand application software, when you use our Website or our Service we or our third party tracking-utility partners gather certain Personal Information automatically and store it in log files. This Personal Information includes some of the same information you provided when you subscribed to our Services, such as organization and username details, date/time stamp, and details regarding the behavior and performance of our Services during each session.

We use this information to monitor performance and usage patterns, to analyze trends, to administer the system, to identify problems being experienced by individual users, and as an aid to the rendering of customer support.

**Cookies**  
As you navigate our Website or Services, certain Anonymous Information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. Our Website and Services typically use a single session ID cookie to help manage resources and to make it easier for you to navigate while using our Website and Services. We use this Anonymous Information to measure the traffic on our Website and Services and to help us make our Website and Services more useful. We delete this information after a period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Website, but your ability to use some areas, features, or functions of our Website may be limited.

The use of cookies by our service providers on our Website is not covered by our Privacy Policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.  

**Clear Gifs**  
We, and our third party partners, may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our Website by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 

We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

**How We Use Your Data**  
Conga only uses and processes Personal Information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In addition to uses described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such purposes include:

  * Providing our Services;
  * Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our Services;
  * Ensuring the technical functioning of Services and otherwise improving Services;
  * To support and maintain Services;
  * Protecting the rights or property of Conga or our users; and,
  * Developing new Services.



Unless specifically stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, any information you provide or that we otherwise acquire from you or on your behalf is never shared with anyone other than Conga employees. Conga, or its third party hosting providers, stores and processes Personal Information in the United States of America.

**Data Security**  
Conga safeguards the security of the data you provide us, or that we receive or retrieve from you with industry-standard physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. Likewise, you should take every precaution to protect your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters, numbers and symbols, and make sure you use a secure browser. 

The  Services use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. We strongly recommend an SSL-enabled web browser. Web browsers developed after Internet Explorer 3 and Netscape 3 use SSL version 3. 

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security of the Services or Website, or your transmission of data to or from us. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at support@congamerge.com.

**Services Security**  
Some of our Services are software solutions hosted in a secured environment by hosting vendors recommended by salesforce.com. Our Services have been certified under the stringent requirements of the salesforce.com AppExchange certification program. 

Conga’s SSL Web Server Certificate provides comprehensive authentication procedures (domain name and identity verification). It provides 256 or 128-bit encryption depending on your client's browser capability and the cipher suite installed on salesforce.com servers and Conga servers.

**Data Handling - Conga Composer ® or Conga Mail Merge®**  
When a salesforce.com user initiates a merge session using Conga Composer or Conga Mail Merge, our systems retrieve from your salesforce.com instance a list of campaigns and reports, plus a list of templates stored in your salesforce.com instance, and presents them as options for potential merge operations. When the user executes the merge, the required data and template are retrieved from your salesforce.com instance, merged and returned to the user in the specified file format. The retrieved data are not permanently stored or accessible for any subsequent operation; each request initiates a complete retrieval of the data required for merging.

If you choose to record the results of an operation using the Log Activities feature, the Service will create new task records associated with the objects that were the focus of your merge session. In addition, if you elect to utilize any feature that allows updating of designated fields in the salesforce.com objects used as the basis for the operation, those fields will be updated with the values you specify.

**Data Handling - Conga Courier ®**  
Conga Courier distributes individual salesforce.com Reports to one or more recipients, either inside or outside your organization, according to a pre-determined schedule. Conga Courier operations are managed through Conga Courier Schedule records created by an administrator or other authorized user and stored in your salesforce.com instance.

During the setup process, the salesforce.com credentials of a specific user are encrypted and stored as part of your Account profile in salesforce.com. Each hour, Conga Courier decrypts and uses these credentials to log on to your salesforce.com account and inspect your Conga Courier schedules to identify those due for processing and to perform routine maintenance, such as calculating the approximate number of times a Schedule will run each month.

When a Conga Courier Schedule is identified as due for processing during the upcoming hour, it is queued for processing. At the specified time, all pending schedules are processed according to the order in which they were queued. The report is retrieved in the specified format, attached to an outbound email message, and released to the designated recipients. Subsequently, Conga Courier returns to the schedule that initiated the report and creates a log entry (Task record) with details regarding the event.

As with Conga Composer or Conga Mail Merge, no customer data is stored within Conga’s systems. Each execution of a Conga Courier Schedule must retrieve again the current version of a report for distribution to designated recipients. As with our other services, Conga Courier security is subjected to a rigorous annual review as part of the ongoing salesforce.com certification review.

**Access To Your Personal Information**  
You may write to us at [support@congamerge.com](mailto:support@congamerge.com "mail") to request that whatever information we have stored be changed, removed, or provided to you. We will respond to your request for access within 30 days. 

We will retain User Details and other data you supply to us in conjunction with use of the Services for as long as a customer account is active or as needed to provide you the Services. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, we will retain User Details as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We do not retain or store any of the data we process on behalf of the users of the Services.  

**Newsletters and Promotional Email**  
If you no longer wish to receive our newsletters and promotional communications from Conga, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at [support@congamerge.com](mailto:support@congamerge.com "mail").

**Testimonials**  
We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain Personal Information.  We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If you want your testimonial removed please contact us at support@congamerge.com.

**Regarding Children**  
We do not intentionally gather Personal Information about visitors who are under the age of 16.

**Links to Other Sites**  
The Website may contain links to other sites, or functionality from third parties (e.g., Youtube), that are not owned or controlled by Conga. Please be aware that Conga is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects Personal Information.

**Disclosure of Personal Information**  
Conga does not share, give away, sell or trade your Personal Information other than as outlined within this Privacy Policy. 

**Legal Disclaimer**  
We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website.

In the event Conga goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred.  Customers will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your Personal Information.   

**Changes to This Privacy Statement**  
Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and. If the changes are material in nature, we will provide a more prominent notice such as a prominent posting on the front page of the site (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes), and you will have 30 days to review the revised Privacy Policy terms.  If you do not agree to the new Privacy Policy, your sole and exclusive remedy is to cancel your subscription to the Services and stop using the Website.
