# Online Privacy Policy – Conduent

## Introduction

### This is the Online Privacy Policy of Conduent in the United States.

This privacy policy covers the websites belonging to Conduent (“Conduent” or “we”) in the United States. It does not cover the websites of Conduent subsidiaries or affiliates who publish their own policies.

At Conduent, privacy on the Internet means that:

  * Conduent informs its website users (“you”) how it uses personally identifiable information that is collected online;
  * Conduent maintains confidentiality and security safeguards for personally identifiable information;
  * You have control over personally identifiable information you decide to submit to Conduent; and
  * You can opt-out of receiving commercial email from Conduent at any time.



Conduent maintains the information it receives online in strict confidence; information you submit to Conduent is not sold to or shared with third parties, except our subsidiaries, affiliates, agents and partners as described in this policy.

Conduent reserves the right to notify you about administrative matters that pertain to your Conduent products or services. We may disclose your personally identifiable information, as required by law or regulation, in connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention, or other legal action; or if Conduent reasonably believes it is necessary to protect Conduent, our customers, or the public. Although we do not currently anticipate a change in our corporate status, in the event of a merger or acquisition of the company or a substantial portion of its assets, Conduent may disclose, transfer or sell personal information collected online to the surviving or acquiring party, respectively. Personal information collected online will remain subject to promises made in this Online Privacy Policy.
