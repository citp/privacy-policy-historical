<p></p><h3><a name="1_1">Information Collection &amp; Use </a></h3><p></p>

<p>For some of our users, we collect your email address, birth year, income information and gender as part 

of the site registration process and application download.  We may also require you to create a password 

associated with your email address.  We will use this information to contact you about the services on our 

site in which you have expressed interest. 
For some of our users, general demographic information such as gender, ethnicity, birth year, and income 

may be collected during the Compete application download process, registration, or API call.  This 

information is integral to our research and used to ensure that we properly represent user online 

behavior.</p>

<p></p><h3><a name="1_2">Communications from the Site</a></h3><p></p>

<p><b>Service-related Announcements:</b>  We may send you strictly service-related announcements on 

rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for 

maintenance, we might send you an email.  If you do not wish to receive these announcements, you may

detailed in <b><a href="#1_4">Choice</a>.</b>  </p>

<p></p><h3><a name="1_3">Information Sharing and Disclosure</a></h3><p></p>

<p>If we have collected your email address, we may partner with a third-party to combine email and 

demographic information collected at this site with other data.  In this instance, we protect your privacy by 

having these third parties sign a written, legally binding confidentiality agreement stipulating that they will not 

share data we provide them with any outside party and that any individual identifying information is to be 

used solely for the purpose of matching records or providing the agreed upon database service.   </p>

<p>We may use third parties, such as a survey software company, to provide services on our behalf through 

their web site.  These third parties are prohibited from using your email address for promotional purposes.

<p><b>Cookies:</b>  A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping 

purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally 

identifiable information you submit while on our site. </p>

<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to allow you to

<p></p><h2><a name="2">Data Collection Technology and Data Usage Privacy</a></h2><p></p>
<p>Compete’s research panel consists of data collected directly through the Consumer Input panel, 

recruiting partnerships with trusted entities or technology integration with partner applications.  Panelists 

who choose to or opt-in to participate in the research panel are made up of people like you who wish to 

participate in market research – consumers who want to express their opinions about the products and 

services they use or that matter to them. </p>

<p>By agreeing to participate, panelists allow their online activities, behaviors and exposures -- including the 

content of specific web pages, online purchasing activities and other activities undertaken during secure 

sessions -- and third party application usage --  types and frequency of applications used -- to be collected 

by Compete. </p>

<p>You must affirmatively agree to download or trigger the data collection by Compete.  If you opt-in for data 

collection, we collect from your computer what is known as click stream data.  Click stream data includes 

information such as your IP address, the URLs (generally the online address information seen at top of a 

webpage) of websites you have viewed (and any information the webpage you're viewing places in those 

URLs, sometimes to pass along to the next page you view), the date and time you viewed the web pages, 

the duration of each visit and the search terms you entered on any webpage that enables online search.   

</p>

<p>Through a combination of a proprietary privacy rules engine (technical rules), encrypted data and secure 

transmission, we strive to protect the identity of our panelists, and removing personally identifiable and 

sensitive information before this data is stored.  If any personal or sensitive information is inadvertently 

collected (because it passes through or is not caught by the filter or technical privacy rules) by the 

application, we make commercially reasonable efforts to purge our database of the inadvertently collected 

personal or sensitive information.</p>



<p></p><h3><a name="2_1">Our Services</a></h3><p></p>
<p>We provide market research in the form of consumer opinions about products and services and 

consumer online behaviors by collecting related information from our panel members. </p>

<p>Typically, the collected information is shared with our clients in aggregate or grouped form so that no 

individually identifiable information is released.  The only exception to this practice is stated below under 

Information Collection.  We do not use panel information as part of a targeted marketing program. We 

respect and honor the privacy of our panelists.</p>


<p></p><h3><a name="2_2">Information Collection – Direct or Via Partnerships</a></h3><p></p>

<p><b>Basic Demographic Information:</b>  For some of our users, general demographic information may 

be collected during the Compete application download process, registration, or API call.  This information is 

integral to our research and used to ensure that we have the right representations of people in our panel.</p>

<p><b>Survey Response:</b>  For some of our users, we may obtain your email address as part of the site 

registration process and application download.  We may use your email address to directly contact you or 

we may work through our partners to contact panel members to ask about their attitudes and opinions about 

a variety of products, services, trends and events.  The questions we ask are presented through surveys 

received by email or on a survey questionnaire website.</p>

<p>Typically, we combine panel members' survey responses and report on the aggregated (or grouped) 

results.  On some occasions, individually identifiable information and responses may be disclosed to retail 

partners or clients so they can gain better insight into their existing and prospective customers.  In such 

cases, we obligate partners and clients to commit that panel members are not directly targeted with 

marketing communications or offers for products and services based on the information we share.</p>

<p>When we occasionally ask for additional personally identifying information as part of a specific survey or 

project, we will provide an explanation in the text of the questionnaire to allow members to make an informed 

decision about whether they want to provide it or not. The explanation will include a description of any new 

identifying information that will be collected via the survey and with whom it will be shared. </p>

<p>As with any survey, members can decline to take the survey or stop at any time during the survey 

process. Like all other information we collect, any additional information collected for a specific survey will be 

used for research purposes only.</p>

<p><b>Online Activities:</b>  As outlined above, we collect information about your online activities, including 

the content of the specific webpages you visit, your purchasing behavior and the applications you use.  

Using the small technology application you download when you agree to join the panel, we collect from your 

computer what is known as clickstream data.  </p>

<p>Clickstream data includes information such as your IP address, the URLs (generally the address 

information) of websites you have viewed (and any information the webpage you're viewing places in those 

URLs), the date and time you viewed the web pages, the duration of each visit and the search terms you 

entered on any webpage that enables online search.   </p>

<p>Through a combination of a proprietary privacy rules engine, encrypted data and secure transmission, we 

strive to protect our panelists.  We make efforts to remove personally identifiable information before the 

collected data is stored in our systems.  If any personal information is inadvertently collected by the 

application, we make commercial efforts to purge our database of that information promptly. </p>

<p>We may also collect information about the cookies that are on your computer which could include 

cookies placed by third parties. We have no access or control of third party tracking technologies. </p>

<p>If personally identifiable information is inadvertently collected by the software, we take commercially 

viable efforts to promptly purge our database of that inadvertently collected sensitive information.</p>

<p><b>Computer Diagnostic Information:</b>  We may collect general computer software, hardware, 

networked devices, and configuration information from the computer where you have installed our application. 

 This information is typically used to address technical and performance related issues if they arise.</p>

<p><b>Cookies, Beacons and Site Logging:</b>  We use temporary session cookies during the download 

and registration process to correctly identify the research panel that the user has joined, enable the creation 

of a unique, anonymous identifier and to trigger the download process. </p>

<p>We may use cookies for advertising research purposes.  By using cookies, we are able to track of the 

types of online advertisements that you see on the websites that you visit, as well as the number of times 

that you see those ads.</p>

<p>In some cases, we may create an event that allows us to anonymously connect your activity from the 

data collection application with a Compete owned third party site cookie.</p>


<p></p><h3><a name="2_3">Our Clients and Data Sharing Practices</a></h3><p></p>

<p>Marketers from leading companies, agencies and publishers turn to Compete to improve their marketing 

effectiveness. Compete helps them by providing market research, media planning and media measurement 

tools to drive their marketing.</p>

<p>Compete uses data gathered from our panel to create a wide array of products for marketers.  Compete 

also offers clients the ability to survey the panel to provide attitudinal data in addition to behavioral measures. 

 With Compete’s products and services, companies can measure their effectiveness across all of their 

marketing programs.</p>

<p>Typically, we combine panel members' responses and report on the aggregated (or grouped) results.  On 

some occasions, individually identifiable information and responses may be disclosed to retail partners or 

clients so they can gain better insight into their existing and prospective customers.  In such cases, we 

make commercially reasonable efforts to filter sensitive information such as credit card numbers and account 

numbers from the data being provided to partners or clients and we obligate partners and clients to commit 

that panel members are not directly targeted with marketing communications or offers for products and 

services based on the information we share.</p>

<p></p><h3><a name="2_4">Other Third Party Disclosure Practices</a></h3><p></p>

<p>We may directly, or with our partners, use a 3rd party for database or software application services (such 

as customer support, email or survey) and for purposes of data quality, data cleansing.  </p>

<p>In addition, we may occasionally supplement information panel members provide us with information from 

consumer profile companies (including public record databases and credit reporting agencies) or use a third 

party service to combine client data with panel member behavioral information to be used for market research 

and segment modeling. In this instance, we protect your privacy by having these third parties sign a written, 

legally binding confidentiality agreement stipulating that they will not share data we provide them with any 

outside party and that any individual identifying information is to be used solely for the purpose of matching 

records or providing the agreed upon database service.</p>

<p>We may also use third party service providers to obtain additional online data, TV or video viewing data, 

application or mobile usage information and may integrate such information with the data that you provide us 

or that we collect from you.  In all instances, any data we collect is used for research purposes only and is 

not used for targeting of marketing communications or to make commercial or economic decisions on an 

individual level.</p>

<p>We will never rent or sell your email address, contact information or other personally identifiable 

information to a third party except as described in this privacy policy under <b><a href="#3_1">Business 

Transitions</a></b> and <b><a href="#3_3">Legal Disclaimer</a></b>.</p>


<p></p><h3><a name="2_5">How to Opt-Out from the Panel</a></h3><p></p>
<p>For users who have downloaded the application directly from Compete, you can opt-out of the Compete 

research panel by removal of the software application.  In cases when the collection is integrated into a 

partner’s application, you have the ability to opt-out of clickstream collection directly through the partner 

application.    If you have any questions regarding removal or opting-out, we can assist you by contacting 

privacy@compete.com .</p>

<p></p><h3><a name="3_1">Business Transitions</a></h3><p></p>

<p>In the event Compete goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another 

company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among 

the assets transferred.  For those users for whom we have a valid email address, you will be notified via 

email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.  We will also put prominent 

notice on our site for 30 days.</p>

<p></p><h3><a name="3_2">Data Access</a></h3><p></p>

<p>For those users for whom we have email and other personally identifiable information, you may correct,

collected by the data collection application, please contact us at privacy@compete.com.</p>

<p></p><h3><a name="3_3">Legal Disclaimer</a></h3><p></p>

<p>If you need further assistance, please contact us via privacy@compete.com. </p>

<p></p><h3><a name="3_5">Security</a></h3><p></p>
<p>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information 

under our control. </p>

<p>In addition, Compete seeks to maintain the privacy and anonymity of its panelists and uses a variety of 

mechanisms to ensure that the data that is collected is handled securely, including:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 90px;">
<li>All online behavioral information is collected anonymously and is not stored along with any user 

identification token (like email address, IP address, name, etc.).</li>
<li>Compete’s data collection technology employs technical privacy rules to strip personal identifiable 

information and potentially sensitive information from clickstream data sent to Compete’s servers.</li>
<li>Compete uses industry standard practices (including physical access control, network level, operating 

system level, and file system level security) to protect unauthorized access to the data.</li>
<li>Compete uses secure transfer mechanisms to move data from public facing servers to the internal data 

center.</li>
</ul>
<p>Panel member information is maintained within a secure database accessible only by certain Compete 

employees.  Panel members may access their own personal information for the purposes of verifying and 

updating, but they cannot view other members' information. </p>

<p>As with any Internet endeavor, absolute security of information transmitted through channels 

(communication networks, hardware, software) not directly operated or controlled by us cannot be 

guaranteed.</p>

<p>Information is stored and processed in the United States within the Compete infrastructure.   In 

accordance with the criteria set forth by the United States Department of Commerce, Compete participates 

in the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework for data protection.</p>

<p></p><h3><a name="3_6">Children’s Privacy </a></h3><p></p>
<p>For the majority of our recruitment, the Compete research panel consists of users who are of the legal 

age of majority within their geography.  On occasion, we may recruit children for a non-adult panel for custom 

research.  In these cases of non-adult recruitment, we will obtain parental consent and adhere to the 

appropriate data laws and regulations, including COPPA.</p>

<p></p><h3><a name="3_7">Privacy Changes</a></h3><p></p>
<p>If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated in our 

privacy policy at the time of collection, you will be notified via email or via the application by Compete or by 

our data partner directly. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different 

manner; instructions for how to make that choice will be included in the email.</p>

<p>If we make any non-material changes to our privacy practices that do not affect user information already 

stored in our database or future collection, we will post a prominent notice on our website notifying our 

members that there is a change and pointing them to the revised privacy page.</p>
