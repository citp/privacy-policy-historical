(“<strong>ConvertMedia</strong>” “<strong>we</strong>“, “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>“) has created a technology platform (the “<strong>Platform</strong>“) and provides related services via the Platform (the “<strong>Service</strong>“) that our customers, which are typically advertisers and ad agencies use to optimize their delivery and management of online advertising campaigns, including interest-based advertising. The Platform is designed to enable these advertising purposes through the use of non-PII (as defined below) that may be collected by customers using the Platform, or that customers may acquire from other sources.</p><p>We respect the privacy of Internet users in general (“<strong>users</strong>“) and wish to set forth in this Privacy Policy (“<strong>Policy</strong>“) ConvertMedia’s practices in connection with the collection and use of information. Please note that this Policy applies only to ConvertMedia and does not state the use practices or policies of our customers, of the websites on which ads are shown, or of other third parties.</p><p>This Policy is in reference to the use of our Service. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ConvertMedia does not own or control or to people it does not employ or manage.</p><p><strong>WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?<br> </strong></p><p>We do not collect or use any Personally Identifiable Information (or “PII”) via the Platform and Service. “PII” is information that by itself can be used to identify a specific individual and includes such things as name, address, phone number, and email address. ConvertMedia further prohibits its customers from providing PII for use on the Platform.</p><p>We also do not collect sensitive consumer information, such as credit card numbers, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, or information about medical conditions.</p><p>We collect only anonymous, non-Personally Identifiable Information; “<strong>non-PII</strong>” is information that cannot by itself be used to identify an individual person and includes such things as browser type, operating system, IP address, the web address of a web page visited, the time and date a web page was visited, and the web address of the referring page. It may also include the number of times a particular browser has been shown a particular ad, or it may include generic information indicating inferences that have been made about users’ interests. We may also collect non-PII information on users’ activities within the websites of our customers.</p><p>We allow third parties to collect and share demographic, intent and interest related data for use in online advertising, it being made completely clear that any such data is provided only in anonymous, non-PII form.</p><p><strong>HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</strong></p><p>The non-PII that we collect is used in order to provide, operate, manage, maintain, and enhance the Platform. The non-PII is also used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring the effectiveness of ads on behalf of our customers and to identify the audience most likely to respond to an advertisement. We may also use non-PII data such as demographic, intent and interest related data we receive from third parties for the purpose of bettering our Platform and Service.</p><p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES?</strong></p><p>ConvertMedia may, in order to operate and enhance the Platform and/or the Service, provide non-PII data collected on the Platform to customers, partners, and service providers who may use such non-PII for their commercial purposes. In addition, we may disclose such information in the event we reasonably believe that we are legally required to do so and/or in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. ConvertMedia may also share aggregated data derived from the Platform, including, for example, statistics about Platform activity. Finally, we may transfer non-PII data to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.</p><p>Please be advised that we cannot control, monitor or be in any way responsible for any PII that a user provides to third party websites when clicking on an ad placed through our Platform.</p><p><strong>COOKIES AND TRACKING PIXELS</strong></p><p>ConvertMedia uses cookies and web beacons in connection with our Platform and Service. Cookies help ConvertMedia better understand the effectiveness of our customers’ ads (for example, by tracking the way in which a user may respond to, select and interact with an ad or any content provided therein, or the location and context in which a user views an ad). ConvertMedia’s cookies also help control the number of times a user views a certain ad. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. A user can instruct his or her browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt the user before accepting a cookie from the websites the user visits. If the user does not accept cookies, however, he or she may not be able to enjoy the full functionality of many of the websites he or she visits.</p><p>ConvertMedia also uses web beacons, in combination with cookies, to analyze usage patterns. The use of a web beacon allows us to record that someone has visited a particular webpage, along with additional Non-PII that the website may choose to include with the beacon.</p><p><strong>Opting Out – What are Your Choices?</strong></p><p>You can opt out of Online Behavioral advertising. ConvertMedia Platform Opt Out: a user can click below to opt out of having the Platform used to select ads based on online behavior. When opting out, an opt out cookie will be stored in the user’s web browser. The Platform will know the choice made by the user when it sees the user’s opt out cookie, and will apply such choice to all of its customers’ use of the Platform. If a user blocks or deletes the opt out cookie, the Platform will not see the user’s choice. Opting out does not imply that the user will not see ads by ConvertMedia.</p><p>To Opt Out as explained above, <a href="http://optout.basebanner.com/OptoutServlet">click here</a>.</p><ul style="font-size: 15px;"><li>The opt out does not block or delete cookies, or prevent the use of cookies for purposes other than selecting ads based on a user’s online behavior. Ads may be selected in other ways, for example, based on the content of the web page in which they are shown. If a user wishes to block or delete cookies altogether, he or she can use web browser settings to do so.</li><li>To opt-out from behavioral advertising in general, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.</li></ul><p>ConvertMedia uses the Evidon assurance platform to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)</a>. As part of this service, ConvertMedia’s online advertisements are sometimes delivered with icons that help consumers understand how their data is being used and provide choice options to consumers that want more control.</p><p><strong>DATA STORAGE AND SECURITY</strong></p><p>All of the user data collected by ConvertMedia is stored in such a manner that cannot be tracked back to specific individuals and information about a specific user cannot be retrieved; we maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect all our data from accidental, unauthorized or unlawful access, use, modification, disclosure, loss, or destruction. However, no security measures, as thorough as may be, are 100% perfect and there can be no absolute assurance of security and therefore, we cannot and do not offer an absolute guarantee or warrant the security of the information we possess.</p><p><strong>POLICY TOWARDS CHILDREN</strong></p><p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@convertmedia.com">privacy@convertmedia.com</a>. If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.</p><p><strong>CHANGES AND CONSENT TO PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p><p>We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy from time to time and it is therefore recommended to check it regularly. Any updates to our Policy are posted here.</p><p><strong>CONTACTING US</strong></p><p>For any questions in regards to this Policy or ConvertMedia’s privacy practices, please contact our representatives at the following email and they will be more than happy to clarify and assist you in any way possible: <a href="mailto:privacy@convertmedia.com">privacy@convertmedia.com</a> or by phone: <a href="tel:+12126479701">1.212.647.9701</a>.</p><p><strong>GOVERNING LAW</strong></p><p>This Policy shall be exclusively governed by and construed in all respects under the laws of Israel, without giving effect to any choice-of-law or conflict-of-law provisions. Any and all legal claims, suits or actions that arise in connection with this Policy or with breach of this Policy shall be submitted to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in the courts of New York, NY.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><script src="http://cicloudfront.s3.amazonaws.com/pix/asyncPixelLoader.js?url=http%3A%2F%2Fconvusmp.basebanner.com%2Fst%3Fcias%3D1%26ttype%3D0%26pix%3D31498398" type="text/javascript"></script></p></div> </article><div id="comments" class="comments-area"><div id="respond" class="comment-respond"><h3 id="reply-title" class="comment-reply-title">Leave a Reply <small><a rel="nofollow" id="cancel-comment-reply-link" href="/privacy-policy/#respond" style="display:none;">Cancel reply</a></small></h3><form action="http://convertmedia.com/wp-comments-post.php" method="post" id="commentform" class="comment-form" novalidate=""><p class="comment-notes"><span id="email-notes">Your email address will not be published.</span> Required fields are marked <span class="required">*</span></p><p class="comment-form-comment"><label for="comment">Comment</label><textarea id="comment" name="comment" cols="45" rows="8" aria-required="true" required="required"></textarea></p><p class="comment-form-author"><label for="author">Name <span class="required">*</span></label> <input id="author" name="author" type="text" value="" size="30" aria-required="true" required="required"></p><p class="comment-form-email"><label for="email">Email <span class="required">*</span></label> <input id="email" name="email" type="email" value="" size="30" aria-describedby="email-notes" aria-required="true" required="required"></p><p class="comment-form-url"><label for="url">Website</label> <input id="url" name="url" type="url" value="" size="30"></p><p class="form-submit"><input name="submit" type="submit" id="submit" class="submit" value="Post Comment"> <input type="hidden" name="comment_post_ID" value="125" id="comment_post_ID"> <input type="hidden" name="comment_parent" id="comment_parent" value="0"></p></form></div></div></main></div></div></div><footer id="footer"><div class="container"><div class="col-md-3 company-details"><div class="icon-top red-text"></div><h4>Technology</h4><h6> <a href="http://www.convertmedia.com/gallery/"><font color="7f8c8d">Ad Unit Portfolio</font></a><br> <a href="http://www.convertmedia.com/platform/"><font color="7f8c8d">Platform</font></a><br></h6></div><div class="col-md-3 company-details"><div class="icon-top green-text"></div><h4>About</h4><h6><a href="http://www.convertmedia.com/company/"><font color="7f8c8d">Company</font></a><br> <a href="http://www.convertmedia.com/careers/"><font color="7f8c8d">Careers</font></a><br> <a href="http://www.convertmedia.com/events/"><font color="7f8c8d">Events</font></a><br> <a href="http://convertmedia.com/category/blog/"><font color="7f8c8d">Blog</font></a><br> <a href="convertmedia.com/newsletter-sign-up/"><font color="7f8c8d">Newsletter Sign Up</font></a><br> <a href="http://www.ui.convertmedia.com"><font color="7f8c8d">Login</font></a><br> <a href="http://convertmedia.com/privacy-policy/"><font color="7f8c8d">Privacy Policy</font></a><br> <a href="http://convertmedia.com/terms-of-use/"><font color="7f8c8d">Terms of Use</font></a></h6></div><div class="col-md-3 company-details"><div class="icon-top blue-text"></div><h4><a href="http://www.convertmedia.com/company/"><font color="939393">Contact</font></a><br></h4><h6> <font color="7f8c8d"> <strong>New York</strong><br> 3 W 18th Street, 3rd Floor<br> New York, NY 10011<br> <a href="tel:+12126479701"><font color="7f8c8d">+1.212.647.9701</font></a><br> <a href="mailto:info@convertmedia.com"><font color="7f8c8d">info@convertmedia.com</font></a><br><br><strong>Tel Aviv</strong><br> 5 Shoham Street, 7th Floor<br> Ramat Gan, Israel 52510<br> <a href="tel:+97236050618"><font color="7f8c8d">+972.3.605.0618</font></a><br><br><strong>Barcelona</strong><br>C/ Rosello 235, Ent. 2do<br> 08008 Barcelona, Spain<br> <a href="tel:+34936814212"><font color="7f8c8d">+34 93 681 42 12</font></a><br><br><strong>London</strong><br>Edmonds House, Station Road<br> Guildford, GU5 9LQ, UK<br> <a href="tel:+447799018536"><font color="7f8c8d">+44 (0) 7799 018536</font></a><br><br><strong>Bangalore</strong><br>209 Wing A, Carlton Towers<br> Old Airport Road,
