Rights</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif">A California 
resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she 
has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household 
purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about 
whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for 
the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has 
made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a 
California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third 
parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar 
year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were 
disclosed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif">However, under 
the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the 
business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of 
not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct 
marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the 
disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, 
the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her 
right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free 
means to exercise that right.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif">As stated in 
this policy, you have agreed to allow us to share information with third parties 
for their direct marketing purposes until you remove your information and thus, 
agreement for such disclosure. To prevent disclosure of your personal 
information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such 
use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites or 
contact us via email to remove your information from our database. Please note 
that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, 
your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you 
later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you 
will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how 
third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of 
any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will 
handle your information.</span></p>
