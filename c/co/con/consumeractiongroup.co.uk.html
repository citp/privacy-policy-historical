Please read the following to learn more\u00a0 \n\tabout our privacy policy. In addition to our own attitude to the importance of your privacy, we are also registered with the Information\u00a0 \n\tCommissioner under The Data Protection Act. Our Data Protection Registration number is Z9440256\n \n\n\n\t \n\tHOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\n \n\n\n\tThis policy covers how we treat personal information that we collect and receive, including information relating to your past use of the\u00a0 \n\tConsumer Forums. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or\u00a0 \n\ttelephone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.\n \n\n\n\tThis policy does not apply to the practices of companies that the Consumer Forums, or Reclaim the Right Limited, do not own or control,\u00a0 \n\tor to people that we do not employ or manage.\n \n\n\n\tBecause of our obligations under the Data Protection Act, we conform with all UK and European standards for the protection of privacy.\n \n\n\n\t \n\tINFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE\n \n\n\n\tThe Consumer Forums collect personal information when you register with any of our forums or buy our products. When you register we may\u00a0 \n\task for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, postal code, occupation, industry, and personal interests.\u00a0 \n\tWhen you register with the Consumer Forums, and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.\n \n\n\n\tThe Consumer Forums collects information about your transactions with us, and with some of our business partners.\n \n\n\n\tThe Consumer Forums automatically receives and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, Consumer\u00a0 \n\tForums cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request.\n \n\n\n\tThe Consumer Forums uses information for the following general purposes: to customise the advertising and content you see, fulfil your\u00a0 \n\trequests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for our internal\u00a0 \n\tpurposes.\n \n\n\n\tThe Consumer Forums does not contact its registered users or its visitors about any products or services other than through its newsletter\u00a0 \n\twhich has been subscribed to as a part of the forum registration process.

However we remind parents to be vigilant over their children\u0027s use of the Internet, and if they have any concerns\u00a0 \n\tabout the Consumer Forums websites they should use the \"Complaints about Website Content\" button on the left side of the main forum webpage.\n \n\n\n\t \n\tUNSOLICITED TELEPHONE CALLS\n \n\n\n\tIf you receive an unsolicited  telephone call offering legal services from any individual or company claiming to be from the Consumer Forums,\u00a0 \n\tConsumer Action Group, CAG, or any similar name, please email  admin@consumeractiongroup.co.uk and do not agree to any service that may be\u00a0 \n\toffered.\n \n\n\n\tWe do not do this.\n \n\n\n\tAny company offering legal services in these circumstances will not be authorised by the Consumer Forums, and will be acting in breach of\u00a0 \n\tthe law.

When you register we may\u00a0 \n\task for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, postal code, occupation, industry, and personal interests.\u00a0 \n\tWhen you register with the Consumer Forums, and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.\n \n\n\n\tThe Consumer Forums collects information about your transactions with us, and with some of our business partners.\n \n\n\n\tThe Consumer Forums automatically receives and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, Consumer\u00a0 \n\tForums cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request.\n \n\n\n\tThe Consumer Forums uses information for the following general purposes: to customise the advertising and content you see, fulfil your\u00a0 \n\trequests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for our internal\u00a0 \n\tpurposes.\n \n\n\n\tThe Consumer Forums does not contact its registered users or its visitors about any products or services other than through its newsletter\u00a0 \n\twhich has been subscribed to as a part of the forum registration process. The Consumer Forums does not contact any person if that person\u00a0 \n\thas not registered as a forum user - even if that person has bought products or services through our website pages.\n \n\n\n\t \n\tCHILDREN\n \n\n\n\tThe Consumer Forums does not differentiate between adults and children in relation to its data use policy, and the same safeguards are\u00a0 \n\tapplied regardless of age. However we remind parents to be vigilant over their children\u0027s use of the Internet, and if they have any concerns\u00a0 \n\tabout the Consumer Forums websites they should use the \"Complaints about Website Content\" button on the left side of the main forum webpage.\n \n\n\n\t \n\tUNSOLICITED TELEPHONE CALLS\n \n\n\n\tIf you receive an unsolicited  telephone call offering legal services from any individual or company claiming to be from the Consumer Forums,\u00a0 \n\tConsumer Action Group, CAG, or any similar name, please email  admin@consumeractiongroup.co.uk and do not agree to any service that may be\u00a0 \n\toffered.\n \n\n\n\tWe do not do this.\n \n\n\n\tAny company offering legal services in these circumstances will not be authorised by the Consumer Forums, and will be acting in breach of\u00a0 \n\tthe law.

<p>
	THE CONSUMER FORUMS PRIVACY POLICY
</p>

<p>
	This policy applies to all forums operated by Reclaim the Right Limited, and includes (but is not limited to) the Consumer Action Group,&nbsp;<br>
	Bank Action Group, Debt Action Group and the Consumer Forums. Hereafter, these are referred to as the Consumer Forums.
</p>

<p>
	<br>
	WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS
</p>

<p>
	Your privacy is a very important matter, and is taken very seriously by the Consumer Forums. Please read the following to learn more&nbsp;<br>
	about our privacy policy. In addition to our own attitude to the importance of your privacy, we are also registered with the Information&nbsp;<br>
	Commissioner under The Data Protection Act. Our Data Protection Registration number is Z9440256
</p>

<p>
	<br>
	HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
</p>

<p>
	This policy covers how we treat personal information that we collect and receive, including information relating to your past use of the&nbsp;<br>
	Consumer Forums. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or&nbsp;<br>
	telephone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
</p>

<p>
	This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that the Consumer Forums, or Reclaim the Right Limited, do not own or control,&nbsp;<br>
	or to people that we do not employ or manage.
</p>

<p>
	Because of our obligations under the Data Protection Act, we conform with all UK and European standards for the protection of privacy.
</p>

<p>
	<br>
	INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
</p>

<p>
	The Consumer Forums collect personal information when you register with any of our forums or buy our products. When you register we may&nbsp;<br>
	ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, postal code, occupation, industry, and personal interests.&nbsp;<br>
	When you register with the Consumer Forums, and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.
</p>

<p>
	The Consumer Forums collects information about your transactions with us, and with some of our business partners.
</p>

<p>
	The Consumer Forums automatically receives and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, Consumer&nbsp;<br>
	Forums cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request.
</p>

<p>
	The Consumer Forums uses information for the following general purposes: to customise the advertising and content you see, fulfil your&nbsp;<br>
	requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for our internal&nbsp;<br>
	purposes.
</p>

<p>
	The Consumer Forums does not contact its registered users or its visitors about any products or services other than through its newsletter&nbsp;<br>
	which has been subscribed to as a part of the forum registration process. The Consumer Forums does not contact any person if that person&nbsp;<br>
	has not registered as a forum user - even if that person has bought products or services through our website pages.
</p>

<p>
	<br>
	CHILDREN
</p>

<p>
	The Consumer Forums does not differentiate between adults and children in relation to its data use policy, and the same safeguards are&nbsp;<br>
	applied regardless of age. However we remind parents to be vigilant over their children's use of the Internet, and if they have any concerns&nbsp;<br>
	about the Consumer Forums websites they should use the "Complaints about Website Content" button on the left side of the main forum webpage.
</p>

<p>
	<br>
	UNSOLICITED TELEPHONE CALLS
</p>

<p>
	If you receive an unsolicited  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Olympus-TP-8-Telephone-Pick-Microphone/dp/B007OXMHDE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415213342&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Olympus%2BTP%2B8" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" data-ipskwclicks="1" data-ipskwclicks-urls="https://www.consumeractiongroup.co.uk/index.php?app=keywords&amp;module=keywords&amp;controller=keywords&amp;do=clicks&amp;id=61&amp;alias=1" class="keywordUrl">telephone call</a> offering legal services from any individual or company claiming to be from the Consumer Forums,&nbsp;<br>

								I'm back for Round 2 of my Southern Water debt issue. Situation so far:
 


	I&nbsp;received&nbsp;a  claim form&nbsp;from Northampton County Court in Dec 2018 with Southern Water being the claimant.&nbsp;The amount being claimed&nbsp;was for dates 11/07/2007 through to 07/07/2018 for £4559.62. After advice on this forum I ran off a defence citing  Statute Barred for some of the dates, and that I had no  Pre Action Protocol. A&nbsp;solicitor letter preceded this from Shulmans, who I believe are linked to UK Search who are the preferred  debt collection company for Southern Water. This is a Letter Before Court Action letter . I'll get back to this in a bit.
 


	Shulmans then wrote to say that they were no longer involved in the case, referring me to&nbsp;Southern Water. After I had sent a defence off,&nbsp;&nbsp;I received correspondence from the courts to inform me that they were transferring the case to a court local to me, and allocating the claim to  small claims track. They also sent forms for the  mediation service which we have both agreed to, and&nbsp;are waiting for this department to contact either/both of us.
 


	During the time since I sent the defence back to the court, I have corresponded with Southern Water via the litigation department after I wrote to them asking for a breakdown of costs being claimed. They agreed that some of the costs being claimed were  statute barred, and adjusted their claim via email with attachments of the bills being claimed. I have offered a token payment ( without prejudice to save costs) which has been accepted, and they are open to offers of regular payments. They also suggested  mediation and suggested a&nbsp;Tomlin order may be a viable option.
 


	Finally, I have now received a Notice of Allocation to the  small claims track which states the following:
 


	1. Allocate this claim to  small claims track
 


	2. The Claimant do send a reply to the defence to the court and the Defendants by 4pm on 8th April 2019
 


	3. This order having been made by the Court pursuant to  CPR Rule 3.3 of the  Civil Procedure Rules 1998, any party affected by this order has the right to apply to set it aside, vary or stay it by application made not more than 7 days after this order was served on the party making the application.
 


	&nbsp;
 


	Here goes:
 


	Back to the Shulmans issue. On 30/10/2018 I received a 'LETTER BEFORE COURT ACTION'. The claim for from the court arrived on 12/12/2018. Which means this is definitely the letter sent prior to instructing the court to issue the  claim form. My question, before I decide whether to continue defending this claim, is that I wasn't to be sure I'm legally sound on believing that this letter is not classed as a  Pre Action Protocol 


	&nbsp;
 


	What does number 3 on the newest form from the courts mean?&nbsp;This is the part that&nbsp; have copied above.
 


	&nbsp;
 


	&nbsp;
 


	Finally, I'm the defendant, so what should the Claimant be replying about on number 2. Do I need to do anything regarding this form. I'm reading it as there is work for Southern Water to do, but nothing on there suggests I have anything to send off.
 


	&nbsp;
 


	Thanks in advance,
 


	Bekki

&nbsp;<br>
THIS IS HOW THE PHONECALL WENT&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I was contacted by future comms by phone, they stated that they could beat any phone contract I have , (I&nbsp;am a limited company but just myself that needs a business phone and I am the only worker)&nbsp;<br>
I told future comms my deal, £110 per month with a phone and a virtual landline,&nbsp;they confirmed that they could beat that, £90 per month with a phone , virtual landline&nbsp; they also confirmed they would pay  Vodafone (previous provider) the termination fee. As I am in business, naturally I was open to making a deal. So we proceeded.&nbsp;<br>
Future comms then revealed that the contract would be with PLAN.COM and the airtime would be provided by 02, I instantly told them that this would break the deal as I have poor 02 signal in the house where I live as my partner is on 02 and constantly complaining about bad signal<br>
the salesman assured me he would send a signal booster box out with the phone so I would have perfect signal.<br>
so far so good.....<br>
i then explained this is the only mobile phone I use for business and pleasure, so therefore I didn’t want any disconnection time in the slightest between the switchover from  Vodafone to 02<br>
the salesman then confirmed that the existing phone would only be disconnected once the new phone was switched on.<br>
so far so good....<br>

							<div class="ipsType_richText ipsType_medium ipsSpacer_both ipsSpacer_half" data-ipstruncate="" data-ipstruncate-type="remove" data-ipstruncate-size="4 lines">I was talked into signing up with Future Comms (future-comms.co.uk) who cold-called me to change my mobile contract to them, via 02, rather than EE. I have a small business (only me!) and it's a business contract. True, the 4G network is better for my area. This company seemed to be a marketing set-up for various telecoms companies, so I assumed anything I signed would be with 02 and didn't think it might be a problem.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
They sent an email whilst I was on the phone to set up the direct debit mandate with my bank which I signed electronically. That was the first, of many, problems I found. Apparently THAT was my contract, binding me to 3 years and no 'cooling off' period, because I was a 'business' (meaning any consumer rights did not apply). When I subsequently asked in writing for a copy of my contract, that is what they sent - when I argued it was a DD mandate they insisted it was my contract!<br>
&nbsp;<br>
2 days later they asked for my phone details to get it unlocked which I sent. 10 days later, EE closed my account, so I changed the SIM card to 02 that had come a few days before. No network! They had done nothing about unlocking it. Fortunately I was lucky with EE who managed to give me the right codes, rather than the usual 10 days to go through Samsung.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
By this time I was suspicious of their set-up and wanted to cancel. As I said earlier, I found myself trapped into a 3 year contract with no 14 day cooling off period (they don't offer that). Promises to deal with my complaints never happened, promised return calls neither....and on and on.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Ofcom's rules apply to consumers and small businesses (under 10 employees), yet this shower don't acknowledge that. They just repeat and repeat that I am a business so it doesn't apply. To cancel the contract I have to pay the full 3 year's fees!!<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I would like to know if others have had similar experiences? Or does anyone know how I can maybe declare the 'contract' unenforceable? I have never before been locked into something without a clear written contract, with t&amp;c's! And, yes, I have asked, and yes, I have been  ignored.</div>
