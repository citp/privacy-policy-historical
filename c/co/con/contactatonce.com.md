# Contact At Once! - Privacy Policy

Your privacy is very important to us and we have the highest respect for the confidentiality of your personal information. The information we receive depends on what you do while visiting our site. We will not obtain personally identifying information about you unless you choose to provide it. If you are browsing our site anonymously, we will automatically collect some non-identifying statistical information to help us measure which pages of our Web site are visited and how long visitors use the site. This information includes things such as your IP address, the time and date, pages entered and time spent on individual pages. Your IP address is not linked to anything personally identifiable. 

Consumers, Merchants and Site Providers logging in to the ContactAtOnce! Service and Portals are subject to different privacy agreements, information use agreements and acceptable use policies that are posted on those sites. 

## Information Use

If you request information from us or wish to access certain features of the site, you will be asked to provide personally-identifying information so that we can respond effectively to your requests and needs. We will never share your information with anyone who isn’t directly related to providing service and support of ContactAtOnce! solutions. If you provide us with personal information, we may attempt to contact you occasionally to determine if our solutions meet your expectations, offer additional assistance or notify you about special promotions. 

## Opting Out

Most customers tell us they appreciate receiving our news and promotions; however, we believe it’s very important for you to be able to choose whether you receive periodic mailings and information from us. You can choose to opt out at any time by simply replying to a mailing to inform us of your preference. All of our mailings will clearly explain how you can easily opt out and stop receiving information from us. 

## Data Security

To help protect your confidentiality, ContactAtOnce! employs security safeguards; however, we can’t eliminate all security risks. For instance, the ContactAtOnce! Web site contains links to other Web sites. We have no responsibility or control over linked Web sites and their privacy policies or the way they collect and control your personal information. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of any Web site before providing personally identifying information. 

## Our Commitment to Privacy

In summary, we believe strongly in respecting your privacy and your wishes about the use of your personal information. While we may need to change this policy from time to time as new situations arise, we will never change our commitment to protecting your confidentiality and informing you of how we intend to use any information you provide to us. Our most up-to-date privacy policy will always be posted here.
