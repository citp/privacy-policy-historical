We may use cookies and other identification technologies for record keeping purposes and to enhance your experience, if you choose to visit our websites  

**Cookies:**  
Cookies are small text files stored on a visitor’s web browser and applications. Cookies are often used to make web-browsing easier by performing functions such as saving passwords and maintaining lists of personal preferences regarding the use of the website. 

Our websites, apps and Services may use the following types of cookies: 

·      Strictly Necessary Cookies – these cookies are essential to enable you to browse our websites, apps and Services and use the available features. 

·      Performance Cookies – these cookies collect information about how you use our websites, apps and Services. For instance, these cookies track which pages you visit most. This data may be used to help optimize our websites, apps and Services and make it easier for you to navigate within them. These cookies do not collect information that identifies you; all information is aggregated and anonymous. 

·      Functionality Cookies – these cookies allow our websites, apps and Services to remember choices you make while browsing, such as geographic location and preferences such as text size and fonts. The information collected by these cookies will not personally identify you. 

**Other identification technologies that may be used by Contact At Once! websites, apps and Services:**

·         Pixel tags (also called beacons or pixels) – these are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a webpage or application, which can retrieve certain information about your device and browser, including device type, operating system, browser type and version, website visited, time of visit, referring website, IP address and other similar information. ****

·         Software Development Kits (also called SDKs) - function like pixels and cookies, but operate in the mobile application context where pixels and cookies cannot always function. The application developer can install pieces of code (the SDK) into the application to collect certain information about user interaction with the application and information about the user device and network information. 

**Third-party technologies:**

Contact At Once! may use third-party service providers who are authorized to place cookies, pixel tags or similar technologies on our websites, apps and Services with our permission.   These technologies help us compile metrics and analytics (without collecting personally identifiable information) to help improve our websites, apps and Services.    Third-party cookies and technologies are covered by the third party’s privacy policy. 

**Your choice:**

Web browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you prefer not to receive cookies, you typically have the option of setting your browser to refuse cookies. If your browser is set to refuse cookies, it is likely that some of the functionality offered by Contact  At Once! will not be available or will not work as effectively for you. 

For further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, you can visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) and [www.youronlinechoices.eu](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). 

**Do Not Track**

Various browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari, currently offer a "do not track" or "DNT" option that relies on a technology that sends a signal to websites a user visits about that user’s browser DNT preferences. While Contact At Once! attempts to honor the DNT instructions received from a user’s browser, Contact At Once! cannot guarantee that it will always respond to such signals because a common industry standard for DNT has not been adopted. Contact At Once! will continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology. 

Contact At Once! does not sell, trade or rent personal information provided by you in any transcript, survey or recording for direct marketing or any other purpose, except as provided in this privacy policy or with your permission.  Contact At Once! does not disclose the contents of transcripts, surveys or recordings other than to service providers performing services on behalf of Contact At Once!, other than as provided in this privacy policy or with your permission.
