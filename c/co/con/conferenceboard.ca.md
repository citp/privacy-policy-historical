### Identifying Purpose

The Conference Board will identify to an individual the purposes for which personal information is collected at or before the time the information is collected. Generally, the Conference Board collects personal information for the following purposes: 

  * to manage and develop the Conference Board’s business and operations, including personnel and employment matters; and 
  * to meet legal and regulatory requirements. 



However, there may be other circumstances that require such information to be collected and used. 

The Conference Board of Canada collects the following personal information from individuals during the course of normal commercial activities. The information obtained includes name, business title, rank, function and general contact information, levels of interest for our services and topics, and transaction activity with The Conference Board of Canada. 

This information is used primarily to determine an individual's entitlement to The Conference Board of Canada’s services. In addition, this information may be used to: 

  * Enable individuals to tailor the presentation of our services to better meet their needs (e.g., a customized home page, selected distribution of our research reports). 
  * Inform individuals about Conference Board products and services that we believe may be of interest to them. 
  * Better understand an individual’s interests in our products and services. 
  * Develop, enhance or improve products and services. 
  * Share delegate or participant information amongst conference and network participants. 



### Cookies

The Conference Board of Canada collects and stores information through our web servers and persistent cookies. Gathered electronically, this information includes the pages visited, referral type, technology used and the Internet Protocol address. This information may be used for the purposes identified in this policy. 

The Conference Board of Canada uses cookies. A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your computer when you access a Web site. There are two kinds of cookies. A session cookie is stored temporarily in your computer’s memory. A session cookie is destroyed as soon as you close your browser. A persistent cookie is a more permanent line of text that gets saved to your hard drive. 

We use session cookies on the Conference Board Web site, to allow you to gain access to a document you requested prior to being signed in. Persistent cookies are used to store your encrypted user ID and password, so that you won’t have to type it in each time that you access our e-Library. This persistent cookie is set if you click on “Remember my sign-in information.” Persistent cookies are also used by our web and marketing analytic services. 

### Consent 

An individual’s knowledge and consent are required before the Conference Board is allowed to collect, use or disclose his or her personal information, except where inappropriate. Where possible, the Conference Board will obtain consent directly from the individual concerned at the time of collection. After having provided consent, an individual has the right to withdraw consent at any time by providing reasonable notice to the Conference Board’s Chief Privacy Officer. 

By subscribing to our reports and services, registering for a seminar, presentation or access to our on-line information services, using other Conference Board member services, or otherwise indicating approval, individuals consent to the collection and use of their personal information for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy. 

The Conference Board will not require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information beyond that required to provide our products or services to you. If you wish to withdraw your consent or to opt out of the uses or disclosures of your information for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, you may do so by contacting our Chief Privacy Officer. If your request requires that we delete your registration information, we will no longer be able to provide you with the services or products for which you have subscribed. Cancellation will be subject to the terms and conditions of the subscription or services provided, as applicable. 

In limited circumstances, the Conference Board may use or disclose personal information without the knowledge or consent of the individual, for example, for purposes of debt collection, breaches of agreements, as required by governmental bodies acting with authority, or as authorized or required by applicable legislation.

### Limiting Collection

The Conference Board of Canada collects only the information that is necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

### Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention

The Conference Board of Canada does not use personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with an individual’s consent or as required by law. Once personal information is no longer required to fulfill the identified purposes or other legal requirements, it will be destroyed, deleted or made anonymous. 

The Conference Board of Canada sometimes uses the services of external firms to assist us in communicating with individuals (e.g., surveys and mail distribution) or as a means of providing more effective and efficient services to these individuals (e.g., technology support). Our external suppliers are contractually obligated to keep the information confidential, to use the information only for the purpose requested and to destroy the information when it is no longer required. 

Customer information is shared with external service providers only to the extent required for the provision of such services. Furthermore, The Conference Board of Canada does not sell personal information to a third-party organization. In certain circumstances, we allow basic contact information to be shared amongst members. Examples of this include providing delegate lists for conferences to other participants or sharing contact information amongst members of our executive networks, to facilitate ongoing communication. 

Personal information is retained only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes stated in this policy.

### Accuracy of Personal Information 

Personal information is kept as accurate, complete and up to date as necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. Individuals are encouraged to provide updates to their personal information as changes occur, to enable us to continue to provide services to them. 

The personal information of customers can be reviewed and modified either directly on-line or by contacting our Web site administrator.

### Safeguarding Personal Information

Personal information, whatever its form, will be protected by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. The safeguards will protect personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. The measures of protection include: 

  * physical measures, for example, locking filing cabinets and restricted access to offices; 
  * organizational measures, for example, security passes and limiting access to the personal information on a “need-to-know” basis; 
  * technological measures, for example, the use of passwords and encryption; and 
  * procedural measures, for example, the shredding of sensitive personal information. 



### Openness 

The Conference Board is committed to being open about its policies and practices with respect to the handling of personal information. Our Privacy Policy is available through our home page and our e-Library Web sites. If a hard copy or additional information is required, requests for such information may be made to the Chief Privacy Officer.
