                        What Personally Identifiable Information do we collect?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The primary purpose of collecting information from you is to provide you with a
                        safe, smooth, effective, and personalized experience and to fulfill the transactions
                        you undertake here. We only collect information about you that we consider necessary
                        to achieve this purpose.</p>
                    <p>
                        Generally, we collect information in three ways. Some information is gathered when
                        you access secure areas within our website. This may include your name, email address,
                        street address, and phone number. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required
                        and which fields are optional. We may also collect personal information when you
                        contact us with questions or feedback. If you contact us, we may keep a record of
                        that correspondence or conversation to better serve you going forward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, you also will have to provide us with credit card and other payment information
                        necessary to complete a payment from you. We use a third party to process and verify
                        credit cards for billing purposes. This requires us to share your name, credit card
                        number, expiration date and billing address with the credit card processing company.
                        When processing a payment transaction we will also obtain information regarding
                        the amount of the payment and other transaction data. We may transfer or disclose
                        this payment information to a third party only to the extent necessary in order
                        to complete the payment processing.
                    </p>

                        What are "cookies" and how do we use them?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Data collection devices, such as "cookies," are used to store, and sometimes track,
                        information about you. Generally, these cookies help provide personalized services
                        and promote trust and safety. A cookie is a small file containing a small amount
                        of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and placed on your computer's
                        hard drive to assist us in providing our services. All pages on the website where
                        you are prompted to login or that are customizable request that you accept cookies.
                        Cookies are only read by the server that placed them and are unable to execute any
                        code or virus. Most cookies are "session cookies," and are automatically deleted
                        from your hard drive at the end of a session. No personally identifiable information
                        is collected with the cookies that we place.

                        More specifically, we use cookies to remind us of who you are and to access your
                        account information in order to deliver to you a more personalized service. We also
                        use cookies, along with IP addresses, to measure your visiting patterns in the aggregate.
                        We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different
                        from one another so that we can make each new experience on our website a better
                        one. We may also use this information to better personalize the content, banners,
