# Interface Advantage Systems

**Privacy Policy**

**OUR COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY**

This site is owned and operated by Interface Advantage Systems Inc. (Herein referred to as IAS) Your privacy on the Internet is imperative to us; we want to make your on-line experience satisfying and safe. **This is our pledge to you:** we will not sell, rent, or give your name or address to anyone. Ever. Period.

Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.

**Definition of the Information IAS gathers and tracks.**

**IAS** gathers two types of information about users:

  * **Voluntary:** Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to register for our events (forums), receive our electronic newsletters, to e-mail a friend about an event, and from participation in polls and surveys.

  * **Aggregated tracking:** Information **IAS** gathers through aggregated tracking, derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Under no circumstances does **IAS** divulge any information about an individual user to a third party. 




**IAS GATHERS USER INFORMATION IN THE FOLLOWING PROCESSES:**

**Optional Voluntary Information**

We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:

**1\. Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)**  
We offer a free electronic newsletter to users. **IAS** gathers the e-mail addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page. 

**2\. Surveys**  
**IAS** may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.

**CHILDREN**

Consistent with the Federal Children's On-Line Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.

**USAGE TRACKING**

**IAS** tracks user traffic patterns within our site. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. **IAS** does break down overall usage statistics across all of our users, tallying users’ domain names, browser types, and MIME types by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).

**IAS** sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.

**COOKIES**

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. **IAS** uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to participate actively in polling and surveys.

**USE OF INFORMATION**

**IAS** uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience with our site, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the site or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.

As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, and surveys. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. **IAS** never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.

**IAS** creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

**SHARING OF THE INFORMATION**

**IAS** uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit user’s needs and better understand our audience demographics. This is essential to offering our free services. We will not share information about individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

**SECURITY**

**IAS** operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers. 

**OPT-OUT POLICY**

We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:

  * Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters.

  * Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information from our users. 




**YOUR CONSENT**

By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by **IAS** If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
