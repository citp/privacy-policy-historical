Cookies are small text files held on your computer. They allow us to give you the best browsing experience possible and mean we can understand how you use our site. Some cookies have already been set. You can delete and block cookies but your experience may be impacted. By using our website you accept our use of cookies.

By viewing or using this Website, you are agreeing to the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy:

## Personal Information Collected

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information, required by the Website to submit in order to proceed, and by which you can be personally identified, and includes your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, account number, and similar information. This Website will not collect any Personal Information about individuals except where it is specifically, voluntarily, and knowingly provided by them.

The Personal Information collected will be used to send you the information you have requested and to provide information that may be useful to you. We may share non-personal, aggregate statistics (group data) about our site visitors’ traffic patterns with partners or other parties; however, we do not sell or share any Personal Information about individual users.

## Use and Retention of Personal Information

It is Coats & Clark’s policy to maintain all Personal Information as confidential, regardless of the purpose for which it is submitted, and to use such Personal Information only for the following purposes:  

(a) For the specific purpose for which it was volunteered; 

(b) To track our visitors’ use of the Website for internal market research; and 

(c) To notify our visitors of updates to the Website, promotional product opportunities, or other services or products that we think you will find valuable and interesting.  

It is Coats & Clark’s policy to keep Personal Information only for so long as needed for such purposes.

Coats & Clark does not sell, rent or otherwise distribute to third parties Personal Information about visitors to the Website, except as needed for Coats & Clark to provide the services for which such Personal Information was volunteered. The Website contains links to sites controlled by, and pages maintained by, independent third parties.

Coats & Clark does not control use of Personal Information provided to such third parties. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect Personal Information from you which will then be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from this Privacy Policy.

Given the global nature of both the Internet and Coats & Clark / Coats Ltd., using the Internet to collect and process Personal Information usually involves the transmission of data on an international basis.  By browsing the Website and communicating electronically with us, you agree that we may export Personal Information to one or more of our offices in other countries and process it there in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Although data may be held in countries that do not have strict data privacy laws, we do take steps to maintain the privacy and security of your Personal Information.

## Protection of Children's Privacy

Coats & Clark / Coats Ltd. does not knowingly collect personal information of any sort from children under the age of 13.

If Coats & Clark becomes aware that it has inadvertently gathered personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our system.

You have a right to review Personal Information about you that is held by Coats & Clark. To obtain a copy of your personal information, or to request deletion of all Personal Information about you in Coats & Clark’s possession,

please submit your request to our Consumer Services department as set out in the “Contact Us” section of the Website.

if their Personal information becomes or has been compromised, pursuant to the provisions of California law.
