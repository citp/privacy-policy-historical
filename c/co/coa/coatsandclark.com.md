Guidelines for using Coats & Clark patterns in printed materials including web sites.

We receive many requests to use Coats & Clark's copyrighted designs/patterns in newsletters, educational materials and on websites. These requests involve materials covered by intellectual property and copyright laws. Coats & Clark has invested a great deal of time, effort and money to develop these materials to inspire and build the market we operate in. We are able to provide some of these materials to others for the same purpose.

_**Patterns and all copy currently available**_ in our _**Free Leaflets**_ or on our _**Internet site**_ can be used with proper credit to Coats & Clark (see sample credits below). Depending on the format, we prefer that the pattern be scanned or photocopied directly from the source, as reentering content can lead to errors and consumer dissatisfaction.

**_Patterns and all copy currently available_** in a **_Coats & Clark book, leaflet,or CD-ROM_** offered for sale may not be used.

_**Pattern and all copy in an archive/discontinued**_ Coats & Clark book may be available depending on whether the product used in the pattern is a current product. Please contact our consumer service department to request permission to use these patterns, as this must be determined on a pattern by pattern basis.

_**Pattern and all copy from a Coats & Clark book where the copyright has elapsed**_ ("in the public domain") may be used, but cannot be given the user's copyright. Rules of copyright ownership specify that for works published after 1/1/78 the term of copyright is 75 years from publication (or 100 years from creation), whichever expires first. For works published prior to 1978, the copyright expires 28 years after the date of first publication.

Web sites using our patterns must print a disclaimer, "This site is not endorsed by Coats & Clark." 

All copyright materials used must provide credit to Coats & Clark whether used in their entirety or used in short excerpts (see credit lines below). A "disclaimer" is also necessary to properly reference our trademarks.
