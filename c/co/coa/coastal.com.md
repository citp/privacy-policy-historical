Essilor Group Canada Inc. ("Coastal", "we", "us", "our") respects your privacy and will at all times seek to comply with privacy laws. This privacy policy covers the site [www.coastal.com](http://www.coastal.com/). The personal information we collect about our users shall be carefully and adequately processed, and will not be disclosed, rented or sold to third parties other than described within this privacy policy.

We collect information to be able to process your order and to offer you our newsletter and special deals when it is time to refill your order (this will include your name, date of birth, e-mail, postal addresses, credit card information and details of any prescription supplied to you by your optician or medical practitioner). You will need to give your consent before any processing takes place and your personal data will only be used for the purposes stated in these terms and conditions and or at the point of collection. We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of personal data protection and will not collect information about you without your consent. 

When you apply for a job we encourage you to create a career account. The information we will collect is name, email address, referral source, address, and a resume that you may either upload to the site or import from linkedin. We use this information to determine whether or not you are eligible for the position in which you have applied and so that we may contact you to set up an interview. 

If you wish to refill your last order we will collect your email address and postal code and use the personal information and prescription information you have on file with in order to fulfill your request. 

We allow you to upload a photo of yourself so that you are able to try glasses or contacts on your photo to see what they would look like on you before ordering. If you wish to remove your photos from the site, you may do so by logging into your account and deleting it or by emailing us at the email address provided below.

If you choose to use our referral service to invite a friend to our site or provide us referrals for job openings, we will ask for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

Or, if you provide your doctor's information, we will ask for your doctor's name and phone number, fax number (optional). We will use and store this information for the sole purpose of verifying your prescription.

Your friend or doctor may contact us at [privacy@coastal.com](mailto:privacy@coastal.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

If you request information from us on the Investors page we will ask for your name, email address and phone number. We use this information in order to provide you with the information you have requested. 

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button [and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site]. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

You can import contacts from your Outlook or other email account address book to invite them to become members of our site. We collect the username and password for the email account you wish to import your contacts from and will only use it for that purpose.

Some pages may have the look and feel of being on [www.coastal.com](http://www.coastal.com/), however the information collected on these pages is not covered under this privacy policy. All information collected on the other domain is owned and controlled by a separate privacy policy.

This site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and read the privacy policy of each and every site that collects personal information. This privacy policy applies only to information collected by this site. 

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website. 

If Coastal is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information. We may also disclose your personal information to any other third party with your prior consent.

We also use other third parties such as a shipping company to fulfill orders, a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services, provide customer service, and an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf. When you purchase items from us, we will share your PII with the third party, as necessary for the third party to provide that service. 

We, Coastal, and our [marketing partners], affiliates, or analytics or service providers, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the website, tracking users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.

Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. These track the online movement of Web users. Instead of being stored on the user's hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period.

### Security Policy

We take the security of your information very seriously. Our e commerce system uses the latest SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) technology - the industry standard for encryption technology. It is used to create a secure transaction environment for commerce on the Internet. If your browser and local network support the use of encrypted data transmissions, our Secure Checkout mode locks all information (i.e.: your credit card number) passed from you to Coastal in an encrypted envelope, making it extremely difficult to be intercepted by an unauthorized party. SSL technology is compatible with Netscape, Internet Explorer, AOL, Web TV and most other browsers. It is the same level of encryption technology that NASA and the CIA use. This ensures that your credit card information remains totally secure. It's about as secure as using your local bank machine. 

### Service-related Announcements

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. 

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. 

### Newsletters

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the "Choice and Opt-out" section. 

### Opt-Out

We provide you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your personal information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any special offer emails from us, you may opt-out at anytime by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each email communication. 

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter. 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at [privacy@coastal.com](mailto:privacy@coastal.com).
