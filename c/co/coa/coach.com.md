# COACH: Security and Privacy

  1. [Stores & Sites](https://web.archive.org/aboutus?contentObject=stores-sites "Stores & Sites")
  2. Security & Privacy



Thank you for visiting [www.coach.com](https://www.coach.com/) (our “Website”), which is owned and operated by Tapestry, Inc. and its affiliated companies (collectively “Coach”).

This privacy policy explains Coach’s information and data processing practices, as well as the choices you can make about the way your personally identifiable information (“PII”) (defined below) is collected and used by Coach.

In this policy, we refer to the companies in our corporate group as "Coach", "we", or "us". We value every customer, prospective employee and employee and want you to trust our business and privacy practices. If you have any questions about the content of this policy, we encourage you to contact us as outlined below.

## Personally Identifiable Information We Collect from You

For purposes of this policy “personally identifiable information” ( “PII”) means any information from which you can be identified - including your name, address, telephone number, email address, billing and account information, credit or debit card information, and other information incidental to providing goods or services to you – as well as information that can be reasonably linked to information that identifies you.

We collect two types of PII from you: (1) information we collect from you directly, and (2) information we collect about you from other sources. Some examples of the manner in which we collect your PII directly include when you:

  * place an order through our Website or in our stores, 
  * register your Coach product after purchase, 
  * register an online account on the Website, 
  * set up a wish list, gift reminders, or address book entries,
  * enter a contest, 
  * take a survey, 
  * contact us with a comment or question, or request a catalog,
  * sign up either online or in-store to receive emails or marketing communication about our Coach products and services, 
  * request to receive investor alerts, or 
  * apply for a job with Coach. 



Some examples of information we collect from other sources include your:

  * interactions with social media to enhance your customer experience with us, and 
  * use of third-party websites that may display our adverts.  



Further details of our data processing practices are outlined below:

## A. Website Registration

To register on our Website, you must complete the registration process by providing PII, which may include your name, address, email, telephone number or mobile phone number, as well as information relating to what you would like to receive from us. If you choose to register, you will be asked to choose a user name and password. 

## B. Shopping with Coach

If you make a purchase from Coach, we obtain PII from you relating to the order. This may be done either online or in-store. The PII collected by Coach varies depending on the location and manner of your purchase, but it will generally include your billing, shipping and payment information. In addition to using this PII to fulfil your order, we also retain order information to better serve you on future purchases and to customize your shopping experience with us. Should you opt in to receive marketing communication from us, or join our clientelling program, we may also use this PII to contact you in connection with other Coach products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, or offer enhanced customization and client care. Again, you may unsubscribe from marketing communication at any time. If you receive your marketing by email, each email will have an unsubscribe button at the bottom.

## C. Employment Applications

If you apply for a job with Coach, PII requested may include your qualifications for the position, your education, applicable licenses or certifications, prior job history, references, and any other information that you may choose to include about yourself. If you are accepted for employment, we will, of course, collect other relevant PII from you and include it in your personnel file with that collected during the application process. The PII that will be collected for purposes of your employment includes your Social Security number.

## D. Marketing Communications

If you choose to sign up for email communications, either while browsing the Website or during one of your store visits, you must submit certain basic information during the registration process, including your name and email address. This PII is used to send you email marketing communications about Coach's latest collections, offers, and news, as well as information on how to participate in Coach events, competitions or promotions.

Coach retains this additional PII, if provided, and uses it to help us better understand and respond to the collective feedback we receive.

Occasionally we may provide a link to a third party website, which is not owned or operated by Coach. If you elect to provide your PII on that third party website, this information will be subject to that third party website's privacy policy and security practices. We are not responsible or liable for any content presented by or contained on any independent website, including, but not limited to, any advertising claims or marketing practices.

This and other required information may be stored by Coach in order to help us better understand how we can design and market our products for you and others.
