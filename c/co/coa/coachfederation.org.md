Throughout the website there may be forms to request information, products, and services. These forms typically ask for contact information (such as your phone, address or e-mail address), financial information (such as your credit card numbers), and demographic information (for example, company product categories, areas of interest, location, etc.) Contact information from these forms is used to send the products, promotional materials or membership information that you request.

Inclusion of links to an outside website, whether in an advertisement or content area of ICF's website, is not an endorsement of the website or a guarantee that the information it contains is accurate.

This site is controlled and operated by ICF from its offices within the United States. ICF makes no representations that materials, information, or content available on or through this site are appropriate or available for use in other locations, and access to them from territories where such materials, information, or content are illegal is prohibited.

#### Site Content

## Spam Policy

Member/coach contact information included on ICF's website is **not** posted for the purpose of promoting/marketing products/services to coaches, but is primarily posted for the purpose of allowing potential clients of a coach to connect with a coach. All other email and electronic communications with members should adhere to the following principles:

  1. You should have a prior relationship with the person receiving your email. (Someone giving you their business card is acceptable in this regard–it implies permission to get in contact. Similarly if someone has sent you an email.)
  2. A valid "from" and "reply to" address must be included with each message.
  3. If you have a subscription list, you should send a confirmation email that the person wishes to be on the list.
  4. There should always be a quick way to unsubscribe from any mail list.
  5. Any request to cease mailing from an individual or organization should be quickly honored.
  6. A complaint involving a breach of this policy may be considered a violation of the ICF Code of Ethics, and therefore referred to the Independent Review Board for their consideration. Should they find a breach occurred, remedies may be required. Sanctions may also be imposed such as suspending or terminating the coach's membership and/or credential with the ICF.



Please note that spam laws and regulations above and beyond ICF's policies may apply to commercial electronic messages sent to individuals who have elected to list their contact information on the ICF website.
