We do not sell, rent or share any personal information about you with other people or except to provide products or services you've requested. All information collected on this site will be kept strictly confidential.

We do not store Credit Card information on our server and we do not keep them on file. Therefore, if you reorder, you will be asked for your credit card information again. Although some website do offer express checkout with keeping your credit card information saved with your account, we chose to not offer this option to give our customers the best protection and security possible.

When you access your Account, we ask for your email address and password. We do this to establish your personal identity and respond with relevant account information. If there is a problem with your order, we may use your name and email address or phone number to contact you.

We may need to disclose user information in certain exceptional circumstances. This may be needed to protect against illegal hackers, to protect our legal rights or to address actual or threatened illegal or harmful conduct. Disclosure may also be required by legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order.

You can access and manage your account information when you are logged into our website. Certain information, such as name or address, can be updated or corrected.
