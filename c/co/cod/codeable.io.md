These third party service providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information. We use cookies to record this information. See our cookie policy below. 



We use your personal information to provide the Service, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.

## Contractor Profiles

You can create a profile if you choose to use our Service as a Contractor. This profile will be publicly viewable via the Service and your personal data will be available to the relevant parties. The processing of your personal data is based on our legitimate interests in relation to the Service, the cf. GDPR, article 6 (1) (f). You may edit your Contractor profile via your account.

## Job/task listing

As a Client you may choose to post a job/task listing via the Service. The contents of such job/task listing will be viewable via the Service.

GDPR, article 6 (1) (f).

## Ratings and feedback

Codeable provides a rating and feedback system where Clients can express their opinions publicly. The Clients review the Contractors after they have transacted.
