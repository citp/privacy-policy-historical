                                               PRIVACY POLICY
SHARING OF INFORMATION
We may share information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:
      • With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such
		         information to carry out work on our behalf;
      • If you live in a jurisdiction where we have an arrangement with a third party reseller
		         or consultant, or if you are using a partner-branded version of the Coding Dojo Service
		         Offerings, we will share information about you with the reseller, consultant or partner to
		         provide you with the products and services you requested;
      • If you establish an account with Coding Dojo after clicking an affiliate link on a third party
		         website, or if your account registration identifies a Coding Dojo partner who referred you
		         to Coding Dojo, your domain name and the time of your referral will be displayed to that
		         partner for tracking purposes, but Coding Dojo will not share the remainder of your email
		         address or any other identifying information (e.g., If JohnDoe@domainsample.com is
		         referred by a Coding Dojo partner at 12 noon on January 1, 2010, the partner could
		         access an administrative page indicating that Coding Dojo received a referral of someone
		         from domainsample.com at that time);
      • If you participate in any interactive areas of the Coding Dojo Service Offerings (such as a
		         bulletin board, blog or chat room), the information you provide may be displayed publicly;
      • In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any
		         applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law,
		         rule or regulation;
      • If we believe your actions are inconsistent with the spirit or language of our user agreements
		         or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of Coding Dojo or others;
      • In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing
		         or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company; and
      • With your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you through the Coding Dojo
		         Service Offerings that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner
		         and you provide such information.
We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to
identify you.
