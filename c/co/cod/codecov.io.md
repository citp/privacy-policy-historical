  1. To service providers that we have engaged to perform business-related functions on our behalf. This may include service providers that: 
    * Conduct research and analytics;
    * Provide customer, technical or operational support;
    * Fulfill orders and user requests;
    * Handle payments;
    * Host our Services;
    * Maintain databases;

With third parties in order to investigate, prevent, or take action (in our sole discretion) regarding potentially illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to any person, us, or the Services, or violations of our policies to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Services.
  4. We may transfer some or all of your Information if we, or one of our business units, undergoes a business transition, like a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or part of our assets, or if a substantial portion of our or of a business unit’s assets is sold or merged in this way. If we believe a transfer results in a material change in the use of the Information we've collected or received about you, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of the transfer.



## ∞ Access To Your Information

Access to certain personal Information that is collected from our Services and that we maintain may be available to you. For example, if you created a password-protected account within our Service, you can access that account to review the Information you provided. You may also send an e-mail to the following e-mail address support@codecov.io to gain access to or to correct your personal Information. Please include your registration information for such service such as first name, last name and e-mail address in the request. If for some reason you wish to remove a repository, you may do so. Please contact support at support@codecov.io to remove all reports and data collected on a repository. On the off chance that you might want to terminate your account, please contact staff at support@codecov.io to erase your account data.

## ∞ Data Security

We have put in place commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the Information we collect online. For example, all rights to gain entrance to data and information are managed over SSL connection and all passwords are 1-way encoded, never plain text.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of Information, we cannot assure you that Information will never be disclosed, altered or destroyed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

## ∞ Other Privacy Matters

  1. “Do Not Track” Signals Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. Codecov currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit its policy on responding to these signals.
  2. International Transfer This Site is governed by and operated in accordance with US law. If you are located outside of the US, you are accessing this Site at your own risk. In particular, your Information will be transferred to and processed in the United States where we operate. By using this Site, you acknowledge that the data protection and other laws of other countries, such as the United States, may provide a less comprehensive or protective standard of protection than those in your country, and consent to your Information being collected, processed and transferred as set forth in this Privacy Policy and US law.
  3. California Residents—Your California Privacy Rights California’s "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We have such a policy in place.
  4. Children’s Information. Our Site and Services are available on general audience websites, which are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13). Codecov does not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under thirteen (13) years of age. If Codecov discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided Codecov with personal information, Codecov will immediately delete that child's personal information from its system.
  5. Material Changes to this Privacy Policy From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. We will notify you about material changes by prominently posting a notice on our Site. We encourage you to periodically check back and review this policy so that you always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and with whom we share it.
