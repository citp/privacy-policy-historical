# Privacy Policy | Code School

This Privacy Policy applies to [www.pluralsight.com](http://www.pluralsight.com/) and [www.codeschool.com](http://www.codeschool.com/), owned and operated by Pluralsight, LLC (“Pluralsight”, “We”, “Us”). This Privacy Policy describes how Pluralsight collects and uses the personal information you provide. It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which you have engaged Pluralsight.

Pluralsight participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Pluralsight is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List at <https://www.privacyshield.gov/list>. Pluralsight is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Pluralsight complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Pluralsight is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Pluralsight may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>. Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website at <https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint>, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

## Collection of your Personal Information

  * We value your trust. In order to honor that trust, Pluralsight adheres to ethical standards in gathering, using, and safeguarding any information you provide.
  * We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you ("personal information"). For example, when you register for a subscription, we will need your contact information: name, email address, and when you provide payment information for a subscription, we will need additional information: address and credit card information for billing. We will retain your name and email address in a user profile. If you choose to use the “Gift a Subscription” feature promoted through codeschool.com, we will ask for your friend’s email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email advising of the gift. Pluralsight stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one time email. Your friend may contact us at [support@pluralsight.com](mailto:support@pluralsight.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.
  * As is true of most websites, we gather site-visitation data automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.



## Use of your Personal Information and Other Data

  * **Personal Information** : Pluralsight uses the personal information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. We use your personal information solely to provide our services to you. We also use your personal information together with other personally non-identifiable information to help us better understand our users and to improve the content and functionality of the site. In order to create an account with our site, we only require you to provide first name, last name, and email address. Additionally, you have the ability to provide additional personal information to complete a profile without our system. We will only use your profile information to personalize and improve your experience with our platform.
  * **Non-Identifiable Data** : We use our log files to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We utilize unstructured machine learning technologies to understand user behaviors and to provide user-specific recommendations.



## Disclosure of your Personal Information

We consider your personal information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your personal information with certain third parties, as set forth below:

  * **Business Transfers** : As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. Your personal information may be transferred to a buyer or other successor in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event in which personal information held by us about our site users is among the assets transferred.



## Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:

We sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. For instance, we use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies are not permitted to use any personal information that we share with them for any other purpose aside from providing services to us.

  * **Legal Requirements** : In certain situations, Pluralsight may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or similar legal process served on our site. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that we only collect that personal data that is relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. Furthermore, we will not process your personal information in a way that is incompatible with these purposes.



## Control of your Personal Information

When you register, or otherwise give us personal information, our site will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated in this privacy policy. We will also give you the ability to opt out before we disclose your personal information to a third party or use your personal information for purposes that are fundamentally different than the purpose for which it was originally created. You may sign-up to receive newsletter or other communications from us. If you would like to discontinue receiving this information, you may update your email preferences by using the “Unsubscribe” link found in emails we send to you or at your member profile on our website or by contacting us at [support@pluralsight.com](mailto:support@pluralsight.com).

## Access to your Personal Information

Upon request Pluralsight will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information. To request this information please contact us at [support@pluralsight.com](mailto:support@pluralsight.com).

We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. If you have filled out a user profile, we will provide an obvious way for you to access and change your profile from our site. We will even allow you to completely delete your profile along with all personal information associated with that profile, although this option may significantly degrade your experience with our platform. If you wish to make this request, please contact us at [support@pluralsight.com](mailto:support@pluralsight.com). We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. If you would like view your personal information that we hold at any time, you may access your profile from our website.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## Security of your Personal Information

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration forms, your information is sent over an authenticated and encrypted connection using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL). We store your personal information only on servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities, and use a variety of technologies and procedures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Nonetheless, no communication via the Internet can ever be 100% secure. Accordingly, you are advised to use caution and discretion when determining what personal information to disclose to us via the site. If you have any questions about security on our site, contact us as follows:
