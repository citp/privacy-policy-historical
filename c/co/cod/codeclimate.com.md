### Visitors

Like most website operators, Code Climate LLC collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Code Climate LLC's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Code Climate LLC's visitors use its website. From time to time, Code Climate LLC may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Code Climate LLC also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Code Climate LLC does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Code Climate LLC's websites choose to interact with Code Climate LLC in ways that require Code Climate LLC to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Code Climate LLC gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Code Climate LLC collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Code Climate LLC. Code Climate LLC does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Code Climate LLC will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Code Climate LLC discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Code Climate LLC believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Code Climate LLC, third parties or the public at large.

We primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Code Climate LLC takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
