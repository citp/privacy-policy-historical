# Privacy | CodeSignal

Effective Date: June 22, 2019

BrainFights, Inc. DBA CodeSignal (“BrainFights”, “CodeSignal” or “we”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy informs you how BrainFights collects, secures, uses and shares personal information about you, and how you can exercise your privacy rights. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (e.g., name, address, email address, or phone number).

Remember that your use of our Services is at all times subject to the [Terms of Use](https://codesignal.com/terms/) and the [Master Subscription Agreement](https://codesignal.com/master-subscription-agreement), which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the [Terms of Use](https://codesignal.com/terms/) or the [Master Subscription Agreement](https://codesignal.com/master-subscription-agreement).

If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your Personal Information, please contact us at using the contact details provided below.

## **Service Privacy Policy**

For the avoidance of doubt, this Services Privacy Policy does not apply to our customers, who manage the Personal Information they collect through our Services in accordance with their own privacy policies. BrainFights only processes the Personal Information that is stored in our Services as a data processor on behalf of our customers and in accordance with their instructions (as defined in our customer agreements), and we have no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personal Information we process in connection with our customers’ use of our Services. For example, if you are invited to take an assessment by a prospective employer that is one of our customers, your Personal Information will be automatically transferred to BrainFights. However, the prospective employer is the data controller and you should contact that entity directly with any questions you may have regarding its privacy policies or data processing practices, and if you want to modify your Personal Information, restrict its processing, or delete it from our Services.

### What information does BrainFights collect or process?

BrainFights processes certain Personal Information input or uploaded into our Services by our customers’ employees, customers’ authorized agency members, and prospective employees, including contact information, employment history, education information, resumes, interview feedback, and communications.

BrainFights will use such Personal Information only as necessary to provide and deliver the Services to the customer, to prevent or address any service or technical issues, to respond to a customer’s support request, or for any other purpose provided for in the customer agreement, or in accordance with or as may be required by law.

### How does BrainFights secure my information?

We take appropriate steps including technical and organizational measures to ensure that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Information, and to protect its loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Such measures include but not limited to:

  * the pseudonymization and encryption of Personal Information;
  * the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;
  * the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Information in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;
  * a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.



### How does BrainFights use my personal information?

BrainFights may access or use the Personal Information collected through the Services for a range of reasons, which may include:

  * To provide, operate, maintain and improve the Services;
  * To handle customer questions and support requests;
  * To process your payments;
  * To manage BrainFights’ platform, system administration and security;
  * To aggregate data about the usage of the Service to analyze trends and optimize customers’ experience;

  * To investigate and prevent fraud, unauthorized access or use of Services, breaches of terms and policies, and other wrongful behavior;
  * To carry out other legitimate business purposes, as well as other lawful purposes about which BrainFights will notify You.



### Will BrainFights ever share my information?

We do not sell or otherwise disclose Personal Information we collect or process in our Services, except as described in this Services Privacy Policy or as we disclose to you at the time this information is collected. As described in more detail below, we may share your Personal Information:

  * with our contracted service providers or third-party data subprocessors. We authorize these subprocessors to use the information only as necessary to assist BrainFights in providing the Services (for example, to provide system administration and hosting services, support ticketing, or to help to enhance security). We require these subprocessors by contract to safeguard the privacy and security of any Personal Information that they process on our behalf;
  * to any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;
  * to an acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets, provided that we inform such third parties that they must use your Personal Information only for the purposes disclosed in this Services Privacy Policy; and
  * to any other person with your consent to do so.



Our customers may choose to integrate their BrainFights accounts with other third party service providers.  While we try to choose integration partners that share our standards for privacy, their websites and services are outside of our control and are not covered by this Services Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for their content, security, or privacy practices.

### How long does BrainFights retain my personal information?

We retain Personal Information we collect or process where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Any Personal Information we process on behalf of our customers is retained in accordance with the timeframes set out in the relevant customer agreements.

### What are my data protection rights?

You have the following data protection rights:

  *  **Notification to third parties.** When we fulfill your individual rights requests for correct (or rectification), erasure or restriction of processing, we will notify third parties also handling the relevant Personal Data unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Upon your request, we will identify such third parties.
