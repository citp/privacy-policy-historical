# CodeTwo Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2016-10-03

CodeTwo Sp. z o.o. Sp. k. (hereinafter referred to as CodeTwo) seated in Poland in the city of Jelenia Gora is the controller of the personal data in accordance with the Act of 29 August 1997 on the Protection of Personal Data.

This Privacy Policy explains how CodeTwo collects and uses data (including personal information).

## What information we collect

While using CodeTwo’s websites and web applications, you may be asked to provide your email address or selected personal details. Providing this information might be required to receive the services you have voluntarily ordered.

You may be asked to provide your personal details while doing the following:

  * requesting sales or technical support via email, phone, LiveChat or online forms;
  * placing orders via email, phone or while submitting an online order form for CodeTwo products or services, or while submitting questions via any other online forms;
  * downloading selected CodeTwo products, whitepapers or marketing materials;
  * creating user accounts and associating your applications (e.g. registering your Office 365 tenant with CodeTwo Email Azure Service) with CodeTwo services;
  * taking part in CodeTwo promotional campaigns.



## User accounts

Some of CodeTwo services and web applications may require you to create a user account on CodeTwo websites. The technology CodeTwo implemented allows you to access your account without having to retype your credentials on a given device. You can opt-out from this feature by unchecking the “Keep me logged in” checkbox on a given login site.

If you share your device with others or disclose your account credentials, they might be able to access your account and see your personal information.

Registering your Office 365 tenant with CodeTwo cloud services is only possible from within your user account. After registering your tenant with CodeTwo cloud services, some of your Office 365 correspondence may start going through CodeTwo servers in order to be processed by CodeTwo web applications (e.g. in order to stamp emails with auto-signatures). CodeTwo neither reads nor stores this data.

## What we do with user information

If you agree to the Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Sales and Services while requesting any services from CodeTwo (e.g. downloading a product, purchasing a product or service or registering a user account), CodeTwo will be allowed to send you email correspondence related to its services. This means you may occasionally receive emails from CodeTwo. The emails will contain essential information on software updates, subscription extensions and other services provided by CodeTwo.

CodeTwo protects your personal data and will not make this information available to third parties, unless you give CodeTwo a permission to do so, or unless it is legally allowed, or unless such disclosure is necessary to meet any applicable governmental need or legal process.

CodeTwo cooperates with the following payment processors:

  * [PayPal ](http://www.codetwo.com/regulations/sales-and-services)
  * [Braintree](http://www.codetwo.com/regulations/sales-and-services)



In order to process payments, it might be necessary for CodeTwo to transfer your personal information to one of the payment processors CodeTwo cooperates with. Nonetheless, the transferred information is limited to that necessary to complete the payment process.

CodeTwo reserves the right to commission another subject to process of your personal information based on Article 31 of the Act of 29 August 1997 on the Protection of Personal Data.

At any time you may:

  * request access to your personal information and request changes;
  * opt out from any correspondence sent by CodeTwo;
  * request a removal of your personal information, email address and/or user accounts.
