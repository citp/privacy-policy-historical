###  Cookies 

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. 

Older portions of our web application use a Session Id that is stored in a cookie and expires when the browser is closed. The JSessionId is used to connect the client with the client's server-side state. When the client changes the page, the same server-side state can be used for the next page. Passwords or demographic data are not stored as part of this process. Only the data about the page is stored in the server memory, such data telling the system which user is logged in so the user doesn’t have to log in again in each time they hit a new page. 

In the case of the orgId that the user currently has open, the cookies are retained so when the user clicks the "Edit" button we can use that orgId to build the Org Edit page with the correct data. Our upcoming application will store virtually no server-side state, but will use a rotating token for authentication purposes. 

Newer portions require an encrypted authorization token that is stored in a cookie between requests.  This cookie expires every 30 minutes.  It is not currently possible to use our site without having cookies enabled, however we are in the process of rewriting all of our web applications so they will not require the use of cookies. 

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. We currently do not store the shopping cart in a cookie.
