                                         Codota – Privacy Policy
Codota Dot Com Ltd. ("Codota", "we" or "us") is committed to protecting the privacy of its users
("users" or "you"). This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") has been created to inform you about how
we manage, collect, store and use the information you provide in connection with our services, website
and/or application (collectively, the "Services"). Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is
limited only to information collected by us through your use of the Services.
By using the Services, you agree to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in
this Privacy Policy. We may amend the Privacy Policy from time to time, and we encourage you to
consult the Privacy Policy regularly for changes.
Information Collected
Our primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and enhance the Services and to
enable users to enjoy the Services.
We do not rent, sell, share, or trade your personal information with third parties other than as disclosed
within this Privacy Policy.
In order to register to our Services, you may be asked, if and as applicable, to sign­in using your
relevant authentication provider service or social network's login (such as your Facebook login). By
doing this, you authorize us, as applicable, to access certain social network account information,
including information about your social network contacts (such as your Facebook friends). By allowing
us to access your social network's account, you understand that we will obtain and may share, without
limitation, your name and profile picture, as well as the name and profile picture of your contacts.
When you register to, or use, the Services or any portion thereof, we may collect and record the
information you provide to us, whether through the Services or through social networks or other third
party services (the "Account Information"). We may also collect and store personal information about
other people that is available to us through your social network login.
Personal Information
"Personal information" means information about you that can be used to contact or identify you. The
personal information types collected in accordance with the Services may vary depending on the
activity and may, without limitation, include:
    (1)   Your name;
    (2)   Your social network or third party service user identification details;
    (3)   Your e­mail address;
    (4)   Location (city and country);
    (5)   List of the members you are connected with through the applicable social network (such as a
          friend list);
    (6)   Your profile pictures; and
    (7)   Any other relevant information included in your application, social network or other online
          profile.
Non­Personal Information


"Non­personal information" is information that, when taken alone, cannot be used to identify or contact
you. During your use of the Services we may collect non­personal information about your use of the
Services. We may also invite you to share non­personal information about yourself which may, without
limitation, include:
     (1) Your age or date of birth;
     (2) Your gender; and
     (3) Any other information included in your application, social network or other online profile.
If non­personal information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, we may
combine your non­personal information with your personal information in an attempt to provide you
with a better user experience, to improve the value and quality of the Services and to analyze how the
Services are used.
In addition to information collected as described above, you may choose to share additional
information about yourself through the Services. Any additional image or information you provide may
be publicly displayed.
Please note that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly­viewable screens
or pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For
example, if you post your e­mail address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control
who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we
encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
Other information we may collect includes your occupation, language, zip code, area code, location,
and the time zone where a Service is used, as well as information about your computer, software,
platform, incident data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, network Media Access Control (MAC) address
and connection, browser type, browser language, referring pages, exit pages and URLs, number of
clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time
spent on particular pages, and the date and time of this activity so that we can better understand
customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising. We may also receive either
non­personal or public information from third parties in connection with market and demographic
studies and/or data that we may use to supplement personal information provided directly by you.
Use of Your Information
The personal information you provide will allow us to send you messages regarding, among other
things, new products, features, enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events
of interest. You may at any time opt­out of any of these communications.
We may also use personal and non­personal information, both individually and combined together, to
better understand the behavior and preferences of our customers, to troubleshoot technical problems, to
serve static and dynamic advertising, to enforce our Terms of Use, to ensure proper functioning of our
products and services as well as to help improve Services and their content. In addition, we may
combine non­personal information with personal information, such as an e­mail address, to administer
loyalty programs, and to tailor our offerings and/or web pages.
If you choose to use a referral service to "tell a friend" about a Service, we may ask you for your
friend's name and e­mail address. We will send your friend an email on your behalf inviting him or her
to visit the relevant website or check out the Service. We store your friend's name and e­mail for the
sole purpose of sending this e­mail and for redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not
receive multiple copies of the same e­mail message. We do not keep or use this information for any
other purpose, unless such friend registered to the Service.
In all cases of data access and collection, the personal information you provide will not be disclosed,
rented, loaned, leased, sold, or otherwise voluntarily distributed to unaffiliated third parties and will be
used solely for the purpose of providing you with and improving the Services and for any other purpose


stated herein. We will retain your information for as long as your Codota account is active or as needed
to provide you the Services. If you wish to cancel your Codota account or request that we no longer use
your information contact us at the e­mail address provided in the "Contact Us" section below. Note that
there may be instances where we are legally required to retain your information.
Access through Social Network Services
By accessing the Services through a social network, mobile device or other third party platform or
service or by connecting to such a third party network, platform or service via the Service, you are
authorizing us to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information
that you agreed the social network, mobile device or other third party platform could provide to us
through the social network / mobile device / third party platform Application Programming Interface
(API) based on your settings on the third party social network, mobile device or platform. Your
agreement takes place when you connect with the third party network, platform or service via the
Services, and/or when you connect with a Service, or "accept" or "allow" (or similar terms) a Service to
access your information through a social network, mobile device or other third party platform or
service.
We may also collect or receive information about you from other users of the Services users choose to
upload their e­mail contacts. This information will be stored by us and used primarily to help you and
your friends connect.
Third Party Service Providers
We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Services or any portion thereof,
to provide the Services or any portion thereof on its behalf, to perform tasks (e.g., without limitation,
maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Services) or to
assist us in analyzing how the Services are used.
From time to time, we employ third party contractors to collect personal information on our behalf to
provide e­mail delivery, product, prize or promotional fulfillment, contest administration or other
services through the Services. When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply your name,
mailing address, telephone number and e­mail address to its contractors. We may ask some third party
contractors, such as, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement personal information that
you provide to us for our own marketing and demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve
our sites and related advertising to better meet our visitors' needs and preferences. To enrich our
understanding of individual customers, we may tie this information to the information you provide us.
Browser Use
Note that in the ordinary course of Internet activity, certain information may be sent from your browser
to third parties such as advertising networks and analytics companies. We have no control over the
information sent from your browser to those networks or other third parties and recommend that you
ensure that your browser settings prevent the disclosure of information you would not like to share.
Disclosure of Your Personal Information
You understand and agree that we may be required to disclose personal information if required to do so
by law or in the belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with
legal process, including, but not limited to a subpoena, statute, search warrant, or court order, or to
protect our, or a third party's, property and rights, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to
prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally
actionable.
We may also disclose information about you if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably
necessary to enforce the terms and conditions of the Services or to protect our operations or users.
Additionally, we may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including your Personal
Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of
bankruptcy.


Cookies
Like many websites, we may use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that is
transferred to your computer's hard disk or your mobile device for record­keeping purposes. Cookies
may be sent to a user’s computer or a mobile device when such user accesses or views a Service.
Information contained in a cookie may be linked to personal information for purposes such as
improving the quality of our Services, tailoring recommendations to interests, and making the Services
easier to use. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your computer
or mobile device. Cookies can be disabled at any time by changing your web browser's options to stop
accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Note
however, that if you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or
functionalities of the Services.
Links
The Services may contain links to other websites or applications. The fact that the Services link to a
website or application or presents a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean that we
endorse or authorize that third party, nor is it a representation of any affiliation with that third party. If
you click on a link to a third party website or application, including on an advertisement, you will leave
our website which you are visiting or application you are running and will go to the website or
application linked to. These third party websites and applications may place their own cookies or other
files on your computer or mobile device, and may collect data or solicit personal information from you.
Other sites and applications follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal
information you submit to them. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot
accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot
guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as us. You are therefore
encouraged to read the privacy policies or statements of other websites and applications you visit
before providing any personal information.
Changing or Deleting Your Information
If you would like us to delete your records in our system, please contact us at support@codota.com and
we will accommodate your request (except to the extent legally obligated to retain certain records).
If you have granted us access to your Account Information through a Service, you may request that we
delete your Account Information by contacting us at support@codota.com . You can request deletion of
your Account Information by dissociating or removing the Codota application from your social
network or third party service account in accordance with the instructions provided by the social
network or third party service.
Security
We have made reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal
information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However,
we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to overcome those measures or
use your personal information for improper purposes.
Information from users outside the United States
Users located outside of the United States, please note that your information will be sent to and stored
in the United States, where our servers are located. By using Codota, you agree to the information
