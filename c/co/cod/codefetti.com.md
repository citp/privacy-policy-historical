You should consult the respective privacy policies of third-party ad servers for more detailed information on their practices as well as for instructions about how to opt-out of certain practices.

### Information we collect and why we collect it

When visitors leave comments on our site, we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service is provided by Automattic (the makers of WordPress).  After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

In addition, we never share or sell your information to third parties.

The information you submit  is used solely to respond to website inquiries or comments and is deleted after one month.

If you previously subscribed to our MailChimp mailing list, at that time you explicitly gave permission for us to email you our periodic newsletters. The information you provided includes your name and email address and your method of sign up.  That information is contained on MailChimp’s servers indefinitely. However, you may unsubscribe from our list or request deletion from the list at any time.

#### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

Codefetti.com has no control over these websites and how they may track or use personal data that they may collect.

#### Log Files

Like many other Web sites, codefetti.com makes use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol ( IP ) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider ( ISP ), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses, and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.

This information is provided as analytics and described in further detail below.

### Who we share your data with

We do business with the following third parties. They collect and use your personal information through secure SSL encryption as follows:

  * [Google Analytics](https://policies.google.com/privacy) – Google Analytics uses log files as described above. Google does not have access to this data, but anyone who has access to your search console will have access to this data.
  * [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacyshield/) – Cloudflare is a content delivery network (CDN) that analyzes traffic to our website in an effort to prevent bad bot attacks.

## How long we retain your data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

For visitors that submit a contact form, your information is deleted within a month, providing us with adequate time to respond to your request and/or receive additional communication from you.
