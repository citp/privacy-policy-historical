      <p>
        Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      We collect the following types of information about you:
      </p>

      <h4>Information We Collect From You Directly</h4>
      <p>
      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account information:</strong> You can browse our site without providing personal information, but you must register in order to access most of the features of Service. We ask for certain information such as your username, email address and password when you create a Codecademy account, or if you correspond with us.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data collected through the use of the service:</strong> After you set up your account, Codecademy members may also choose to provide additional information which may be shared through public profiles, such as your name, location, website, links to your social media profiles, and other information. You control how much personally identifying information you wish to provide in your public profile.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Messages and User Content:</strong> We may retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>

      <p>
        We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages. You can control your receipt of email messages by visiting “Settings” within “Edit Account Settings” page on our website. We may also send you Service-related emails (e.g. account verification, change or updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt-out of Service-related e-mails. For more information about your communication preferences, see “Your Choices Regarding Your Information” below.
      </p>

      <h4>Information We May Receive From Social Networking Sites</h4>

      <p>
        If you create an account on our website through a third-party connection or log-in, for example through Facebook, Google+ or Twitter, or by “following,” or “liking” Codecademy on a third party social media site, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Codecademy. This information could include the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join Codecademy. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Codecademy Service.

      <h4>Information Automatically Collected</h4>

      <p>
        We automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our website or use our Service. When you visit the Site, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g. the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us to track your usage of the Service over time. We may collect log file information from your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. Log file information may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, information about your mobile device, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit, your use of third party applications, and other information that

      </p>
      <p>
        We use or may use the data collected through cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our website and our Service; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (f) otherwise to plan for and enhance our service.

      <h3 class="margin-top--2 margin-bottom--1" id="how-we-store">How We Store And Protect Your Information</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Storage and Processing:</strong> Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Codecademy or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. Codecademy may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Codecademy or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Keeping your information safe:</strong> Codecademy cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of third party sites and services that you add to the Codecademy Service, such as social networks. Codecademy is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.
      </p>

      <h3 class="margin-top--2 margin-bottom--1" id="childrens-privacy">Children's Privacy</h3>

      <p>
        Our Service is not directed at children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect or solicit information from anyone under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information collected from a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@codecademy.com">legal@codecademy.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 class="margin-top--2 margin-bottom--1" id="school-privacy">Schools Privacy</h3>

      <p>
        In some circumstances, we may permit a School to register Students to our service for the purpose of providing educational services. Because Codecademy provides the Service to School to benefit and enhance the School’s curriculum, Codecademy relies on the school to obtain and provide appropriate consent, if needed, to collect personal information of students.
      </p>

      <h3 class="margin-top--2 margin-bottom--1" id="links-to-other">Links to Other Websites and Services</h3>

If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies. Please check the individual policies before you submit any information to those websites.
