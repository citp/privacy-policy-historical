          <p><strong>How do we protect visitor information?</strong></p>
          <p>Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p>
          <p>We implement a variety of security measures when you place an order, and when you enter, submit, or access your information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p>
          <p>All transactions are processed through a gateway provider (Stripe) and are not stored or processed on our servers.</p>
          <p><strong>Do we use 'cookies'?</strong></p>
          <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enable the site's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to authenticate your browsing session. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
          <p>We use cookies to:
            </p><ul>
              <li>Understand and save your preferences for future visits.</li>
              <li>Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third party services that track this information on our behalf.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>
          <p><strong>If users disable cookies in their browser:</strong></p>
          <p>If you disable cookies, it will turn off some of the features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.</p>
          <p><strong>Third Party Disclosure</strong></p>
          <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.</p>
          <p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></p>
          <p><span class="spr">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. See more</span><a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">here</a>.</p>
          <p>According to CalOPPA: users can visit our site anonymously; we link to this Privacy Policy on the home page; and our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the home page.</p>
          <p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page. Users are able to change their personal information by logging into their account or by emailing us.</p>
          <p><strong>How does our site handle do not track signals?</strong></p>
          <p>We generally attempt to honor Do Not Track (DNT) browser signals when possible but cannot guarantee 100% coverage.</p>
          <p><strong>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</strong></p>
          <p>Yes, for example, via Google Analytics.</p>
          <p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></p>
          <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>
          <p>We adhere to the following COPPA tenets:
            </p><ul>
              <li>We will not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to particapate in our service.</li>
              <li>Teachers and parents can agree to the collection and use of their students' information, but still not allow disclosure to third parties.</li>
              <li>Teachers and parents can review, delete, and manage their students' information through account settings on our website or by emailing team@codecombat.com.</li>
              <li>We notify teachers and parents directly before collecting PII from their children. This includes what specific information will be collected and how it might be disclosed, a link to our online privacy policy, and how teachers and parents can give their consent.</li>
              <li>Parents can give consent by creating accounts for their children and providing the minimum necessary personal information needed during that account creation.</li>
              <li>Student accounts for use in school settings can only be created with consent of a teacher.</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></p>
          <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
          <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices, should a data breach occur, we will notify the affected users via email within 7 business days.</p>
          <p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
          <p><strong>CAN-SPAM Act</strong></p>
          <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
          <p>We collect your email address in order to:
            </p><ul>
              <li>Authenticate your user account.</li>
              <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li>
              <li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders</li>
              <li>We may also send you additional information related to your product and/or service (optional).</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:
            </p><ul>
              <li>NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses</li>
              <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way</li>
              <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters</li>
              <li>Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if used</li>
              <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly</li>
              <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can change your email settings in your account preferences, email us, or follow the instructions at the bottom of each email, and we will promptly remove you from all correspondence.</p>
