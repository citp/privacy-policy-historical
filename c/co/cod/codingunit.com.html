        <p><strong>Your privacy is important to us!</strong><br>
To better protect your privacy, we provide this statement explaining our online information practices and  the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this site.</p>
<h3>The Information We May Collect</h3>
<p>At some of our sites, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion,  subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities.  The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include:  name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your  interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.</p>
<p>At some of our other sites, you can submit information about other people.  For example, you might submit a person’s name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and,  if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient’s name and address.  The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include:  recipient’s name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.</p>
<p>At certain parts of some of our sites, only persons who provide us with the requested personally  identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in  the site’s activities and offerings.</p>
<p>We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of  our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer),  the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS) and the domain name of  your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).</p>
<h3>How We Use the Information</h3>
<p>We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for  our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings,  and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when  you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our subscriber agreements,  to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.</p>
<p>We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards.  From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them.</p>
<p>The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an  interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities  and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services.</p>
<p>If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a “letter to our editors”, questions for an online chat guest, a posting to a blog or a discussion board), we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us.</p>
<p>We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to  improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your  Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site  usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.</p>
<p>We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Web Site and applicable laws or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements. In addition, we may transfer personally identifiable information about you if we, or one of our business units, are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company.</p>
<p>Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized  disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable  information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>If you have signed up to receive our e-mails and prefer not to receive marketing information from this site, follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided on any marketing e-mail you receive from this site.</p>
<p><strong> Finally, our sites covered by this Privacy Statement  will not use or transfer personally identifiable information  provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above  without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.</strong></p>
<h3>Cookies &amp; Web Beacons &amp; third-party advertising companies</h3>
<p>To enhance your experience with our sites, many of our web pages use “cookies.”  Cookies are text files we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences.  Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally  identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us  by, for example, registering at one of our sites.  However, once you choose to furnish the site with  personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.</p>
<p>We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content  and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize  your experience at our web pages (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save  your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites.  We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.</p>
<p>“Web beacons” or clear .gifs are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the  behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to  count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.  We may use web beacons on this site from time to time for this and other purposes.</p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website.  These companies may use information (<strong>not including</strong> your name, address, email address, or telephone number)  about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of  interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not  having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">click here.</a></p>
<h3>How to Contact Us</h3>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the online privacy statement for this site or its implementation  you may <a href="mailto:contact@codingunit.com?subject=About%20Privacy%20Policy">contact us.</a></p>
<h3>Updates &amp; Effective Date</h3>
<p>From time to time, we may update this privacy statement.  We will notify you about material changes in the way we  treat personally identifiable information by placing a notice on our site.  We encourage you to periodically check back and review this policy so that  you always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose it.</p>
