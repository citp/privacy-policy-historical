### Website Privacy Policy

##### This Privacy Policy was last updated Sept, 2013.

Like most website operators, Codewars collects non-personallyidentifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use its website. From time to time, Codewars may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Codewars also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Codewars only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

Certain visitors to our websites choose to interact with Codewars in ways that require Codewars to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Codewars gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at Codewars.com to provide a username, email address, and link to their GitHub account. In each case, Codewars collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Codewars. Codewars also may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Codewars does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Codewars discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide services available at our websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using our websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Codewars will not share with or sell your potentially personally-identifying information to other organizations for commercial purposes, except when we have your permission to provide you products or services that you’ve requested. If you are a registered user of a Codewars website and have supplied your email address, Codewars may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Codewars and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Codewars takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Codewars uses cookies to help Codewars identify and track visitors, their usage of Codewars website, and their website access preferences. Codewars visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using our websites, with the drawback that certain features of our websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change our Privacy Policy from time to time, and in our sole discretion. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
