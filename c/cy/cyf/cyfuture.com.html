              <p> <strong>What About Cookies?</strong><br>

                our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or
                
                control over these cookies.</p>
              <p><strong>Does CyFuture Share the Information It Receives?</strong><br>
                Yes, we do share

                your personal information without your consent. </p>
              <p> ¤<strong>WHOIS</strong><br>
                the Internet Corporation requires us for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"),
                
                the organization that assumes responsibility for domain name allocation,

                43" WHOIS service. For the purposes of this Privacy Notice we will
                
                refer to this information as your "WHOIS Information." Please
                
                note that we may not be able to control how members of the public may
                
                use the WHOIS Information.</p>
              <p> ¤<strong> Advertisers:</strong><br>
                We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and
                
                advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can
                
                identify any individual person.</p>
              <p> ¤<strong>Partners:</strong><br>
                We partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user
                
                signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact
                
                information that is necessary for the third party to provide these
                
                services.</p>
              <p>¤ <strong>Agents:</strong><br>
                We engage other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
                
                processing credit card payments, providing marketing assistance,
                
                providing customer services, sending postal mail and email to you,
                
                removing repetitive information from customer lists, and analyzing data.
                
                These persons have access to personal information needed to perform
                
                their functions. These companies do not retain, share, store or use
                
                personally identifiable information that you provide to CyFuture for any
                
                secondary purposes.</p>
              <p>¤<strong>Service Providers:</strong><br>
                We engage other companies and individuals to perform enhanced services on
                
                our behalf. For example, we have engaged Critical Path, Inc. to provide
                
                free electronic mail services to our domain name registrants. In
                
                addition, certain of our enhanced services such as our Web Site
                
                Generator require that we contact Internet directories and various
                
                search engines on your behalf. Many of our service providers have access
                
                to personal information needed to perform their services. These parties
                
                are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for
                
                the purpose of providing these services.</p>
              <p> ¤<strong>Business Transfer:</strong><br>
                As we continue to develop our business, we might sell
                
                or buy businesses or their assets. In such transactions, customer
                
                information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also,
                
                if Cyfuture. or all or substantially all of its assets were ever to be
                
                acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred
                
                assets.</p>
              <p> ¤<strong>Compliance:</strong><br>
                We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
                
                comply with law; enforce or apply our Services Agreement and other
