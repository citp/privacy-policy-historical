You may always refuse to provide Personal Information to us, but this may lead to our inability to provide you with certain information, products, or services.

If you do provide us with Personal Information, we may enhance or merge it with information about you obtained from third parties for the same purposes.

**Other Information Collected by Lilly Online**

We may also collect information that does not identify you ("Other Information"), such as the date and time of website session, movements across our website, and information about your browser, We do not tie Other Information to Personal Information. This Other Information may be used and stored by Lilly or its agents. Other Information we collect may include your IP Address (a number used to identify your computer on the Internet) and other information gathered through our weblogs, cookies or by other means (see below). We use Other Information to administer and update our website and for other everyday business purposes. Lilly reserves the right to maintain, update, disclose or otherwise use Other Information, without limitation.

This site may use a technology known as web beacons — sometimes called single-pixel gifs — that allow this site to collect web log information. A web beacon is a graphic on a web page or in an e-mail message designed to track pages viewed or messages opened. Web log information is gathered when you visit one of our websites by the computer that hosts our website (called a "webserver"). The webserver automatically recognizes some non-personal information, such as the date and time you visited our site, the pages you visited, the website you came from, the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows 2000), and the domain name and address of your Internet service provider (e.g., AOL). We may also include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages in order to determine whether messages have been opened.

This website may use a technology called a "cookie". A cookie is a piece of information that our webserver sends to your computer (actually to your browser file) when you access a website. Then when you come back our site will detect whether you have one of our cookies on your computer. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the site and help us analyze site usage more accurately. For instance, our site may set a cookie on your browser that keeps you from needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the site. With most Internet browsers or other software, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions to learn more about these functions. If you reject cookies, functionality of the site may be limited, and you may not be able to take advantage of many of the site's features.

This website collects and uses Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet. Generally, an IP address changes each time you connect to the Internet (it is a "dynamic" address). Note, however, that if you have a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance, it is possible that your IP Address that we collect, or even perhaps a cookie we use, may contain information that could be deemed identifiable. This is because with some broadband connections your IP Address doesn't change (it is "static") and could be associated with your personal computer. We use your IP address to report aggregate information on use and to help improve the website.

Lilly, or services for the collaboration in which they and Lilly are engaged (for example, some of our products are developed and marketed through joint agreements with other companies).

In exceptionally rare circumstances where national, state or company security is at issue, Lilly reserves the right to share our entire database of visitors and customers with appropriate governmental authorities.
