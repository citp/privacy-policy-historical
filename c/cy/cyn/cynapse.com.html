  <div class="note">Updated 23rd April, 2010</div>
  
  <p>Cynapse India Pvt. Ltd. and its affiliated companies and subsidiaries (collectively  referred to here as “we,” “our,” or “Cynapse”) created this Privacy Policy to  inform our website users (including users of features and functionality on our  websites), event registrants/participants, newsletter/information recipients, promotion  participants, online community participants, those who download, purchase or  inquire about our products and services, and others (collectively referred to  as “customers”) about our practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure  of personally identifiable information (“personal data”) that we collect from  them.  </p>
  <p>While  Cynapse’s websites or other materials may include links or references to non-Cynapse  websites, materials, or entities, this Privacy Policy does not apply to those  non-Cynapse sites, materials, or entities unless otherwise indicated.</p>
  <h4>Your Consent</h4>
  <p>You should read this entire Privacy Policy before submitting  information to Cynapse or using any Cynapse website<em>.  </em>Whenever you submit  information via a Cynapse website site or otherwise to Cynapse, whether online or  offline, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information  in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <h4>COPPA Requirements</h4>
  <p>Cynapse complies with the requirements of the Children’s Online  Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the FTC’s Rule interpreting COPPA (16 CFR §  512).   Our websites are not directed to children and we do not knowingly  collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of  age through our sites.</p>
  <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
  <p align="left">Cynapse may collect personal data from  customers both online and offline.  In many cases, such information will be  collected directly from you, such as through a transaction or inquiry, or your  submission of a form, registration, or communication to us.  Information may  also be gathered from third-party sources (including without limitation, opt-in  lists, publicly available data, consumer reporting agencies, other companies, and  referrals) and through your activities and interactions with us.  We may  combine data collected from these disparate sources unless we tell you  otherwise.  </p>
  <p>Cynapse collects personal data about its customers in a  number of ways.  In this section, we describe what types of personal data we  collect, the ways we collect it, and how we use it.  While we have tried to be  complete, this list is not necessarily exhaustive, given that these activities  can vary from time to time.  </p>
  <p>The types of personal data typically collected by Cynapse  may include the following, depending on your activities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Contact  information, including name, title, street address (home, work), postal code,  country, telephone numbers (home, work, cell, etc.), email address (home,  work), company name, and other similar information.</li>
    <li>Personal/demographic  information, including birthdate/age/age group, gender, birth date, level of  education and the like.</li>
    <li> Authentication  information, including user IDs, log-in names, passwords, password reminders, etc.  (in addition to other personal data such as contact information, birth date,  and the like).</li>
    <li> Transactional  information, including products or services you download, inquire about, or  request; payment information.</li>
    <li> User  content, including information provided when you use one of our online  communities, forums or other online means of communications, and all other user  submissions and content you provide. </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="left">As you use our websites, some information can be “passively” collected  using various technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, and navigational data  collection (clickstream, log files, server logs).  Your Internet browser  automatically transmits some of this information, such as the URL of the  website you just visited and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and browser  version currently being used by your computer.  Such technologies help us to  keep track of your interactions with our websites and provide you with a more  customized experience. </p>
  <p>As is the case with many websites, Cynapse  websites may use cookies and other automated information collection means.   Cookies are information about you from the website that is stored on your  browser or hard drive.  Cookies save you time because you do not need to  manually re-enter the information stored on your hard drive.  Cookies also help  us upgrade the website by showing when and how users use the site.  You can set  your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or refuse cookies altogether,  but certain features of Cynapse websites might not work without cookies.</p>
  <p>Cynapse websites may also use IP addresses  for the same purposes identified above, as well as to analyze trends,  administer the site, track users' movements, gather broad demographic  information for aggregate use and to confirm that a particular individual  affirmed his/her consent to specific legal terms.</p>
  <p>We may use web beacons (also known as  Internet tags or clear GIFs) on our websites to access and set cookies and  otherwise help us to better understand how users are moving through our  websites.  Information provided by the web beacon includes the computer’s IP  address, the type of browser being used, and the time that the web beacon was  viewed.  We may also use web beacons in emails and newsletters so that we know when  such communications have been opened and to otherwise help us tailor our  communications to individual users.</p>
  <p>Finally, we also monitor the performance  of our services and our sites in order to manage, maintain, and improve our  services and sites. We (or our third party providers) may use tools to help  prevent and block "spam" communications, viruses, spyware, and other  harmful or unwanted communications and programs on the site. These tools may  automatically scan any content you upload through the sites (or using  functionality available via the sites) in order to help us protect you and the  site against these harmful or unwanted communications and programs. However,  these tools do not collect or disclose personally identifiable information  about you.</p>
  <p align="left">Cynapse uses personal  data about customers for a wide range of purposes.  We use it to respond to  your requests (including requests for newsletter subscriptions, materials, support,  and so on); to provide products or services that you have ordered; to process  your order transactions and contact you regarding your order; to provide  materials you have requested; to invite and help you participate in a range of  online and offline events, and/or activities; to allow you to post information  and other content online (including in response to other postings); to improve  our products, services, and websites; to follow up with you after you have  communicated with us or submitted information to us; to send promotional  communications or offers (unless you have requested that we not send such  communications); for marketing and research purposes; for internal and/or  external training, quality assurance, and other purposes (including without  limitation, call center recordings); to permit you to participate in and to  otherwise administer sweepstakes, promotions, and contests; to allow you to  contact another person; for legal and contractual reasons; to address your  interests and concerns; and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy  and/or at the point of personal data collection.  Here is some additional  details on our use of the data we collect: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conducting and following up on transactions.  Cynapse may use  personal information such as name, title, street address, phone number, email  address, title, and/or company name to conduct transactions with you, process  your order, contact you about your order, and so on.</li>
    <li> Registration (events, memberships, accounts (i.e., log-ins  and passwords, etc.)) and participation in online communities/provision of  user-generated content.  Customers may be given an opportunity to register for  a variety of reasons, including to receive promotional communications/offers;  to join/participate in an online community, blog, chatroom, or other  interactive areas or to otherwise provide user-generated content (such as  posting favorite photos/videos/audio recordings, providing testimonials,  sharing experiences about Cynapse products, etc.); to attend an event (e.g., a  conference); and so on.  Such activities may entail collection of name, title,  contact information, birth date, user name and password, email address,  experiences with Cynapse products, and personal information/preferences related to  the subject matter of the particular activity.  In some cases, you will select  a user ID and password when you register, and you will use this to gain access  to certain registration-restricted areas.  Note that using a Cynapse website as a  registered user enables information that is passively collected as you navigate  the site to be associated with personal data actively collected from you on the  site.  Cynapse may use and/or disclose any personal data captured in an online  community.  You are responsible for any postings you make in any online  community.  Before submitting any user-generated content, you should review and  adhere to any applicable Terms of Use [include link] and also keep in mind that  anything you make available as a participant in an online community or submit  for posting by Cynapse may be made available for others to see; you should  therefore carefully consider whether you wish to submit personal data, or any  data, for these purposes.  Any content submitted to an online community will be  subject to the Terms of Use located at <a href="http://www.cynapse.com.com/terms-use;" title="www.cynapse.com.com/terms-use;">www.cynapse.com.com/terms-use;</a> therefore,  please read such terms carefully prior to submitting or posting any  information.  We reserve the right to not post or make available and/or remove  any data submitted to us, as further described in the applicable Terms of Use at  <a href="http://www.cynapse.com/terms-use" title="www.cynapse.com/terms-use">www.cynapse.com/terms-use</a> </li>
    <li> To contact us with questions, comment, or concerns.  We  provide a number of ways for you to contact us to ask questions, provide  comments, or share concerns.  This may occur, for example, via the “contact us”  sections on Cynapse websites, or postal mail.  Depending on the circumstances, we  may collect your name, title, contact information, age group, message type,  case number (if tied to a previous issue), comments, and other types of data  relevant to the specific situation (e.g., product involved, use of the product,  any problems with the product, and the like). </li>
    <li> To provide materials you request.  We provide a number of  ways for you to request materials from us, such as newsletters, blog/rss feeds,  brochures, product literature, and the like.  Cynapse may collect and use contact  name, title, contact information, age-indicative information, demographic  information, preferences, and other information relevant to responding to your  request.</li>
    <li> To permit your participation in contests, sweepstakes, and  other promotions.  To participate in sweepstakes, contests and other similar  promotions, we often collect name, title, contact information, age-indicative  information, and gender, as well as other information related to the particular  activity.  We will indicate which information is required (e.g., to contact  winners, to verify eligibility to participate, etc.) and which is optional  (e.g., demographic information, preferences, etc., designed to help us better  understand you and address your interests).</li>
    <li> For marketing purposes (unless you have told us  otherwise).  We and our partners may use your contact information to tell you  about other products and services that we believe might be of interest.  If at  any time you do not want communications for promotional purposes, please let us  know (see the “It’s Your Choice” section of the Privacy Policy).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We may disclose personal data you provide to our affiliates  and partners and to consultants, service providers, and contractors that we use  to support our business and operations (e.g., delivery services, financial  institutions, fulfillment services, technical support, advertising, public  relations, media and marketing services, sweepstakes and contest-related  services, legal services, call-in centers, e-commerce and other web-related  services such as web hosting and web monitoring services, and event-related  services such as online and offline data capture services) who have agreed to  keep the information confidential and use it only to provide the applicable  service(s).  In some cases, we work with other companies who help to gather  information from you or help us to communicate with you.</p>
  <p>Where the law allows it, Cynapse may share customers’ personal data  with affiliates or with selected  third-party partners to enable them to market their or other selected third  parties’ products and services to you.</p>
  <p>We may also disclose personal data to third parties  (including without limitation, governmental agencies) if required to do so by  law, regulation, or court order; to respond to governmental and/or law  enforcement requests; to identify, contact, or bring legal action against  someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with our (or others')  rights or property; to support any claim, defense, or declaration in a case or  before any jurisdictional and/or administrative authority, arbitration, or  mediation panel; or in connection with disciplinary actions/investigations.   Likewise, we may disclose personal data to third parties in connection with the  sale, assignment, or other transfer of Cynapse, its business or the site to which  such data applies.</p>
  <p>The  recipients of customers’ personal data,  and more generally these disclosures, may be located in Mumbai, India or other jurisdictions that might not provide a level of  protection  equivalent to the laws in your jurisdiction.  By submitting personal  data to Cynapse,  you consent to the transfer of such personal data outside your  jurisdiction.</p>
  <p>We may make full use of all information that is de-identified  or otherwise not in personally identifiable form, including without limitation,  user-generated content.  We will not, however, make use of any content you  upload to a virtual online community that you or your organization has created  through the use of our fee-based licensed products and services.</p>
  <h4>Materials provided to Cynapse or posted at any Cynapse website</h4>
  <p>Cynapse does not claim ownership of the materials you provide to Cynapse (including  feedback and suggestions) or post, upload, input or submit to any Cynapse Web Site or its associated services (collectively "Submissions"). However, by posting, uploading, inputting, providing or  submitting your Submission you are granting Cynapse, its affiliated companies and necessary sublicensees permission to use your Submission in connection with the operation of their Internet businesses including, without limitation, the rights to: copy, distribute, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, made accessible to search engines, reproduce, edit, translate and reformat your Submission; and to publish your name in connection with your Submission, unless otherwise governed and explicitly  secured by additional contracts.</p>
  <p>No compensation will be paid with respect to the use of your Submission, as provided herein. Cynapse is under no obligation to post or use any Submission  you may provide and may remove any Submission at any time in Cynapse's sole  discretion.</p>
  <p>By posting,  uploading, inputting, providing or submitting your Submission you  warrant and represent that you own or otherwise control all of the  rights to your Submission as described in this section including, without limitation, all the rights necessary for you to provide, post, upload, input or submit the Submissions. </p>
  <h4>Security</h4>
  <p>Cynapse takes  appropriate steps to protect personal data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized  access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, whether in transmission or  storage.  Please keep in mind, however, that there is no such thing as perfect  security, and no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free.   Moreover, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any user  name and password you use.</p>
  <h4>It’s Your Choice: Contact Preferences</h4>
  <p>We  want to keep in touch with you in ways that you find to be beneficial.  By submitting  personal contact information, you are agreeing that we may communicate with you  via email, telephone, direct mail, and/or other means of communication.  If you  don’t want us to use your contact information for promotional purposes (such as  to tell you about other products and services that might be of interest), please  tell us that when you provide your contact information.  You can also let us  know your preference later by contacting us as specified in the “Contact Us”  section below, or by following the instructions in various communications that  we may send you.  Keep in mind that these preferences regarding promotional  contacts do not mean that we might not contact you for other reasons, such as  those related to an order you placed, an inquiry you made, a newsletter to  which you may have subscribed, a membership you undertook, an event for which  you registered, a legally required notice, and so on.  </p>

  <h4>Access</h4>
  <p>To keep personal  data provided by you accurate, current, and complete, please contact us as  specified in the “Contact Us” section.  We can then take appropriate steps to  update or correct such information in our possession, or to delete your  information from our contact list.</p>
