We use cookies on this website. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.

Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookie by clicking "Tools", "Internet Options", "Privacy", and selecting "Block all cookies" using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.

**(3) Information about your browser software's user agent string.**

When you visit a web page, your browser sends the user agent string to the server hosting the site that you are visiting. This string indicates which browser you are using, its version number, and details about your system, such as operating system and version. The web server can then use this information to provide content that is tailored for your specific browser. The user agent string is anonymous data that is not indicative of and cannot be traced to an individual without the cooperation of their Internet Service Provider. HiSoftware only collects this non-personal data to accelerate resolution of specific support inquiries.
