The data is stored on the servers of these payment providers and is not transmitted on CYRILLUS servers at any time. 

Thus, when you enter your card number (credit card), authorization searches are automatically transmitted in encrypted mode. The authorizations and data are then checked with your bank to avoid abuses and fraud.
