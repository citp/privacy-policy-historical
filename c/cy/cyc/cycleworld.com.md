**What Information is Collected on this Site?**

**User Provided Information**

HFM U.S. does not collect any Personally Identifying Information such as name, address or e-mail address on its Web sites without the knowledge and consent of the individual concerned. Such information is collected through registration forms, games and contests and through voluntary online questionnaires that appear from time to time on some HFM U.S. Web sites. "Personally Identifying Information", or just "Personal Information," includes your name, home or other address (like a school), e-mail address, telephone number, or any other information that may identify you or allow contact with you (online or offline). 

We may also ask you to provide other information about yourself such as your age, hobbies, likes, dislikes, etc. 

You may review the Personal Information that you have provided to HFM U.S.'s Web sites by e-mailing privacy@hfnm.com or writing to HFM U.S. at 1633 Broadway, 40th Fl., New York, NY 10019 ATTN: Online Circulation. We will send you a copy of the Personal Information we have on file (if any). You may send us new or updated information at any time.

**Site Usage Information**

**Cookies**

We try to provide you with services, products and offers customized to your interests. In order to do that, we use "cookies" to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not gather any Personally Identifying Information about you; they simply track where you travel on the HFM U.S. Web sites and what you look at. In doing so, a cookie may enable HFM U.S. to relate your use of the Web sites to Personally Identifying Information that has already been submitted. Many other web sites use cookies for very similar purposes.

Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Refusing a cookie will not interfere with your use of a HFM U.S. Web site. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. These cookies are sent from third-party computers and are subject to such third parties' policies.

HFM U.S.'s Web advertising technology company, DoubleClick, also uses cookies. The non-personally identifiable information collected by DoubleClick is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of DoubleClick's advertisers and Web publishers who specifically request it. For additional information on the information that is collected by DoubleClick, please click here to check its Privacy Policy.

**IP Address**

Our server automatically collects data about your server's domain address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you're on the Web. When you request pages from HFM U.S., our servers log your IP Address. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us, e.g., a search engine. Our server cannot automatically record your name or address.

  
**How is the information used?**

We will use the Personal Information you provide to our Web sites to fulfill a specific purpose. For example, Personal Information will be used to enter you in a sweepstakes or contest, to send to an e-newsletter or fulfill a product or service order. We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record keeping. In addition, we may send you e-mail notices about products, services, companies and events that we think might interest you. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings from us by following the instructions in the e-mail you receive from us or sending an e-mail to the e-mail address provided in the Opt-out section below. 

We use cookies to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver better and more personalized services; estimate our audience size for our advertisers; assist in processing items in your shopping basket; track the number of entries in our promotions, sweepstakes and contests; and identify which areas of our site you have visited. We may also match information obtained from cookies with data provided by you or collected by third parties. We analyze this data both in the aggregate and in connection with individual users. This information lets us give you the services you want that are connected with your interests. We also provide the analysis of our users (as a group, of course) to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties.

HFM U.S. uses IP Addresses for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider (i.e. AOL, Earthlink, etc.).

  
**Does HFM U.S. share Personal Information and Site Usage information with others**?

When registering on the Site, HFM U.S. provides visitors an opportunity to receive offers from advertisers and other companies who have services, products and offers that we think might be of interest to you. If you do not at that time indicate a preference not to receive such offers, HFM U.S. will from time to time provide your contact information to these entities so that they may send you these offers. If you do not decline to receive such offers at the time you provide your information or if you change your mind and no longer want us to share your contact information with others, send an email to the email address provided in the opt-out section below. 

If you provide information to HFM U.S. in connection with a promotion with another Web site or entity, the information you provide will be used for the purpose for which you provided the information and will be shared with that partner. Your Personal Information may also be used for other purposes that may be disclosed at the time your information is requested.

HFM U.S. reserves the right to analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in and use of the HFM U.S. Web sites. HFM U.S. may disclose such analyses to advertisers or other third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user.

**Right to Opt Out**  
You have the right to "opt-out" of certain HFM U.S. uses of your Personal Information. At the time you are requested to provide Personal Information on this Site, you will have the opportunity to elect not to receive e-mail offers from HFM U.S. or have your Personal Information shared with other companies. You may also make this request by sending an e-mail to privacy@hfnm.com. In this e-mail please say whether you would like to opt-out of receiving e-mail offers from HFM U.S. and/or having your Personal Information shared with other companies. You may also opt-out of HFM U.S. e-mails by clicking on a link within the email replying back to an e-mail you receive. Please understand that if you opt-out of receiving e-mails from HFM U.S., we may still contact you by e-mail in connection with your account with us or to provide you with important information about HFM U.S. or this Site. Also, a request to have us stop sharing your Personal Information with other companies will only apply as of the date of the request, and HFM U.S. will not be responsible for any communications that you may receive from companies that received your Personal Information prior to such request. In these cases, please contact that company directly. 

**E-mail**  
If you contact HFM U.S. by e-mail, you should be aware that e-mail transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by e-mail in transit. HFM U.S. will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during transmission.

**Legal Authorities**  
We may disclose user information to government authorities at our discretion. We also may disclose user information when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other HFM U.S. site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. 

**Business Transfer**  
In the event that HFM U.S. or substantially all of its assets are acquired by one or more third parties as a result of a merger, sale, consolidation or liquidation, customer Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets.

**Consent to Processing**  
By providing Personal Information to this site, you understand and consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries and territories.

**Access to other sites through the HFM U.S. Sites**  
When you are on an HFM U.S. site you will have the opportunity to visit, or link to, other sites not operated by HFM U.S.. These sites, some of which are HFM U.S. advertisers and partners, may collect personally identifiable information about you. HFM U.S. does not control sites that are operated by others and is not responsible for the information practices of these sites and this privacy statement does not address the information practices of those web sites or advertisers.

**HFM U.S.'s Right to Change this Policy**  
HFM U.S. reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Policy, or any other HFM U.S. policy or practice, at any time without notice to any users of HFM U.S. Web sites. Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting to the Web sites.

**Security/Enforcement**  
HFM U.S. will take reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all personal information provided to the HFM U.S. Web sites. However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, HFM U.S. cannot guarantee that this information will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. Any unauthorized access to or use of the HFM U.S. Web sites or information collected and maintained by the HFM U.S. Web sites should be immediately brought to the attention of HFM U.S. at the customer service e-mail address below. HFM U.S. will investigate, and if necessary take action to prevent or halt, any violation of this Privacy Policy of which it becomes aware.

**REMEMBER \- DO NOT DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CHAT ROOMS, THROUGH VOICE CHAT OR ON MESSAGE BOARDS. WHENEVER YOU DO SO, ALL OF THAT INFORMATION CAN BE COLLECTED AND USED BY OTHERS. IF YOU POST PERSONAL INFORMATION IN PUBLIC PLACES, OTHERS MAY SEND YOU UNSOLICITED E-MAIL MESSAGES. BE CAREFUL AND BE SMART WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.**
