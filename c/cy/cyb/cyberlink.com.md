Your Personal Information and the CyberLink Website  
As a visitor to our Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information. In connection with other activities, such as subscribing to the newsletter or downloading trial software applications, CyberLink may ask you to register to the CyberLink membership program. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, CyberLink may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), e-mail address, telephone and facsimile numbers, birthday, and other personal information. When ordering products or services on the Site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. Please note that CyberLink does not sell, rent, or otherwise distribute your personal information 

'Cookies' and the CyberLink Website  
Like most corporate websites, we do use a variety of methods to track usage of our website. The CyberLink website does use 'cookies' to monitor your visits to our site and to identity CyberLink registered members. By placing a 'cookie' on your hard drive, we are able to recognize return visitors. 'Cookies' can also help us to learn more about your usage patterns on our site. We use the information gathered by 'cookies' to enhance our services, respond to your requests and improve our communication with you.

After entering this information, a 'cookie' containing information about your hardware and your software will be placed on your hard drive. Should you contact CyberLink Online Support again in the future, you will not need to re-enter your specific hardware and software information provided that this 'cookie' is still present on your system.
