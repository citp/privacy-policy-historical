## Cookies

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer's browser directory or program data subfolders. Cookies may be created when you use your browser to visit a website that uses cookies to keep track of your movements within the site, help you resume where you left off, remember your registered login, theme selection, preferences, and other customization functions.

There are two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are created temporarily in your browser's subfolder while you are visiting a website. Once you leave the site or log out, the session cookie is deleted. On the other hand, persistent cookie files remain in your browser's subfolder and are activated again once you visit the website that created that particular cookie. A persistent cookie remains in the browser's subfolder for the duration period set within the cookie's file.

CyberGrants use of cookies is restricted to session cookies, therefore does not leave artifacts on user workstations. In addition, CyberGrants only tracks a user's session ID and does not track Personally Identifiable (PI) data.

## Choice/Opt-Out

We communicate with users (donors), whose employer subscribes to our services, on a periodic basis via email or phone to resolve or investigate customer service issues. We may also use your email address to confirm your philanthropic activity, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law. Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications. A user can however remove themselves as a qualified donor by contacting their company's Human Resources department.

By virtue of applying for a grant with a CyberGrants subscribing company, grantseekers or non-profit organizations are consenting (opting-in) to CyberGrants use of the organizational information they provide. We communicate with non-profit organizations on a periodic basis via email or phone to resolve or investigate customer service issues. We may also use your email address to notify you of updates to philanthropic activity, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law.

## Data Retention

CyberGrants will not retain your personal data longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws, regulations, or client specific data retention policies.

## Children's Privacy

CyberGrants does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under the age of 13, we will immediately assess whether it is appropriate to retain this information in our system. A number of CyberGrants clients sponsor scholarship programs that may award grant dollars to children of any age.
