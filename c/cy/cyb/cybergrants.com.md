Your mobile device permits you to turn off the location services. Please be sure to manage your mobile device and privacy preferences for the use of our Services.

CyberGrants adheres to the following guidelines to protect your right to privacy:

  * CyberGrants never sells your personal information to anyone or any organization.
  * Our websites collect limited technical information about your computer. Such information includes your TCP/IP address, your browser type and your domain. The information we collect is used only by our support staff to assist us in monitoring system performance and up-time.
  * Your membership is protected via SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). This measure of protection is used by many electronic commerce sites and on-line banks to protect personal and financial information. SSL assures that your data, including personal information entered by an individual or transmitted to CyberGrants by a client, is protected using the highest level of data encryption available. Personal information is never stored on CyberGrants laptops or other portable devices.
  * Licensed users access CyberGrants by inputting a username and personal password. These are unique in our database; your password should never be shared with anyone.
  * Circumstances may arise where CyberGrants decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize our company. Such a transaction may involve, in accordance with applicable law, the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is CyberGrants' practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these instances.
  * We may collect and possibly share personal data and any other additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of CyberGrants' terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

### Data Retention

CyberGrants will not retain your personal data longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws, regulations, or client specific data retention policies.

"Session" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as managing page views and your shopping cart. Typically, your browser will erase session cookies once you exit the browser. "Persistent" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computer or mobile device after you exit the browser. Persistent cookies allow us to retrieve certain information that you have previously provided to us (e.g., your user ID if you asked for it to be remembered). Our sites may use both session and persistent cookies.

Our sites may also use "tracer tags," which are tiny graphic images placed on our site pages or in our e-mails that allow us to determine whether you have performed certain actions. When you access these pages or open e-mail messages, the tags generate a notice of that action to us or our Providers. These tools allow us to measure responsiveness to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions. Our use of cookies for tracer tags is restricted to session cookies, therefore does not leave artifacts on user workstations. In addition, CyberGrants only tracks a user's session ID and does not track Personally Identifiable (PI) data.
