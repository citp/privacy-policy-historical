      <h4>Policy Statement</h4>
         <p>As an application service provider, CyberGrants,  Inc. (CyberGrants) is highly committed to protecting the privacy of your  information. We have developed this Privacy Statement in support of our  commitment to safeguarding your personal information.</p>
         <p>In accordance with our commitment to protect personal privacy,  CyberGrants complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the  U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, as set forth by the U.S. Department of  Commerce.  The Safe Harbor Frameworks, which were developed in  consultation with the European Commission and the Federal Data  Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland, consist of the  seven Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, as well as fifteen Frequently  Asked Questions (FAQs).

         <h4>Collection and Processing of Your Personal Data</h4>

The information  we collect is used only by CyberGrants support staff to assist us in the  monitoring system performance and up-time, as well as troubleshooting  technical issues.</p>
         <h4>Use and Purpose of Collected Personal Data</h4>
         <p>We do collect information about our users to assist  us in maintaining your membership. You can rest easier knowing that this  information is used exclusively to better serve our customers and is  not sold to anyone for any reason.  CyberGrants, Inc. adheres to the  following guidelines to protect your right to privacy:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>We only use your personal information to help us  manage your account, to improve our services to you, to provide you with  products you have requested, and to inform you about additional  products or services that may be of interest to you.</li>
           <li>We only use your information for customer contact,  account maintenance, billing, and to inform you of new features,  improvements and any other customer-affecting reason.</li>
           <li>CyberGrants never sells your personal information to anyone or any organization.</li>
           <li>The CyberGrants.com website collects limited  technical information about your computer. Such information includes  your TCP/IP address, your browser type and your domain. The information  we collect is used only by CyberGrants support staff to assist us in the  monitoring system performance and up-time.</li>
           <li>Your membership is protected via SSL (Secure  Sockets Layer). This measure of protection is used by many electronic  commerce sites and on-line banks to protect personal and financial  information. SSL assures that your data, including personal information  entered by an individual or transmitted to CyberGrants by a client, is  protected using the highest level of data encryption available. Personal  information is never stored on CyberGrants laptops or other portable  devices.</li>
           <li>Licensed users access CyberGrants by inputting a  username and personal password. These are unique in our database; your  password should never be shared with anyone.</li>
           <li>The CyberGrants.com website contains links to  other sites on the web; CyberGrants, Inc. is not responsible for the  content, security, privacy, capabilities or availability of such sites.</li>
           <li>Circumstances may arise where CyberGrants decides  to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize our company. Such a  transaction may involve, in accordance with applicable law, the  disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers,  or the receipt of it from sellers. It is CyberGrants' practice to seek  appropriate protection for information in these instances.</li>
           <li>We may collect and possibly share personal data  and any other additional information available to us in order to  investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,  suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical  safety of any person, violations of CyberGrants' terms of use, or as  otherwise required by law.</li>
           <li>Changes made to this policy are posted to this website as necessary.</li>
         </ul>
         <h4>Cookies</h4>
         <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your  computer's browser directory or program data subfolders.  Cookies may  be created when you use your browser to visit a website that uses  cookies to keep track of your movements within the site, help you resume  where you left off, remember your registered login, theme selection,  preferences, and other customization functions.</p>
         <p>There are two types of cookies: session cookies and  persistent cookies. Session cookies are created temporarily in your  browser's subfolder while you are visiting a website. Once you leave the  site or log out, the session cookie is deleted. On the other hand,  persistent cookie files remain in your browser's subfolder and are  activated again once you visit the website that created that particular  cookie. A persistent cookie remains in the browser's subfolder for the  duration period set within the cookie's file.</p>
         <p>CyberGrants use of cookies is restricted to session  cookies, therefore does not leave artifacts on user workstations. In  addition, CyberGrants only tracks a user's session ID and does not track  Personally Identifiable (PI) data.</p>
         <h4>Choice/Opt-Out</h4>
         <p>We communicate with users (donors), whose employer  subscribes to our services, on a periodic basis via email or phone to  resolve or investigate customer service issues. We may also use your  email address to confirm your philanthropic activity, and to send  notices and other disclosures as required by law. Generally, users  cannot opt out of these communications. A user can however remove  themselves as a qualified donor by contacting their company's Human  Resources department.</p>
         <p>By virtue of applying for a grant with a CyberGrants  subscribing company, grantseekers or non-profit organizations are  consenting (opting-in) to CyberGrants use of the organizational  information they provide. We communicate with non-profit organizations  on a periodic basis via email or phone to resolve or investigate  customer service issues. We may also use your email address to notify  you of updates to philanthropic activity, and to send notices and other  disclosures as required by law.</p>
         <h4>Data Retention</h4>
         <p>CyberGrants will not retain your personal data  longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was  collected or as required by applicable laws, regulations, or client  specific data retention policies.</p>
         <h4>Children's Privacy</h4>
         <p>CyberGrants does not knowingly collect Personal Data  from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected  Personal Data from a child under the age of 13, we will immediately  assess whether it is appropriate to retain this information in our  system. A number of CyberGrants clients sponsor scholarship programs  that may award grant dollars to children of any age.</p>
         <h4>Changes to this Privacy Statement</h4>
         <p>CyberGrants reserves the right to change this  Privacy Statement and will publish changes to this statement via our  website. We encourage individuals to review the Privacy Statement  periodically to stay apprised of updates.</p>
         <h4>Inquiries, Access and Updating Your Personal Data</h4>
         <p>CyberGrants needs your help in keeping the personal  data you have shared with us accurate and up to date. If you are a  registered user, you may make these updates yourself online via <a href="http://www.cybergrants.com/">CyberGrants</a>.</p>
         <p>Dispute resolution for Safe Harbor issues is handled through eTrust. They may be contacted through <a href="http://etrust.org/" target="_blank" title="eTrust">http://etrust.org/</a></p>
