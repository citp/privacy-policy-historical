Cookies enable us to personalize these advertisements and track their frequency and placement.

**Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technologies:** A Web beacon (sometimes referred to as a "pixel tag" or a "clear GIF") is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a Website, e-mail, or other communication. Web beacons are typically one-pixel, transparent images and are used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database in order to associate that individual with previously acquired information about him/her in a database. They allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that accesses the Website on which the beacon appears, the URL of such a Website, the time that such a Website was viewed, the type of browser used to view such a Website and the information contained in any cookies set by the third party. We may use Web beacons and other similar tracking technologies to help us better manage content on the Services by informing us what content is effective. For example, Web beacons allow us to measure the success of Our marketing campaigns by providing insight into the actions taken by users of the Services (e.g., compiling statistics about the rate at which certain marketing e-mails are opened by their intended recipients).
