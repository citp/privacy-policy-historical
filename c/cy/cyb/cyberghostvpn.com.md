## How do we collect non-personal data?

We automatically collect anonymous Non-personal Information through different technologies as described below.

### A. Website:

Our website may use 3rd parties such as Google Analytics and third-party analytics, such as Facebook, Bing, Yahoo, Twitter and MixPanel, to better understand how you use the Site and ways that we can improve your experience. Through these tools, we can see trends of usage of our Website such as total number of unique users, popular webpages or articles by number of total impressions, etc. These third parties use pixels or cookies to measure things such as the average time spent by users on the Site or visited pages so we learn how to improve the Site for you. Please see more information about this in our Cookie Policy [https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_US/cookiepolicy](https://web.archive.org/en_US/buy) .

To learn more how Google uses data from our use of Google Analytics Cookie we recommend you review Google’s policies located at: [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners). We also encourage you to review the Google Analytics' currently available opt-outs for the web tool available at: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>.

Lastly, as stipulated above to provide you with online chat support, we use Zendesk. Zendesk collects both personal as well as anonymous information.

The performance of the Service is measured through a series of events sent anonymously to third-party services (MixPanel) which is building aggregate data based on certain trends. Few examples of events are indicatively mentioned below:

Connection Attempt: We collect this information to know the usage request directed to our Service on a particular hourly/daily/weekly/monthly interval, the country of origin (but not your source IP address), your CyberGhost VPN version, etc. This metric allows us to properly adjust our infrastructure according to the demand.

Connection Successful: We collect this information to know how many users per hourly/daily/weekly/monthly intervals successfully established VPN connections to our service. This information correlated with the above event results, is helping our engineers to determine if there are any network issues which might prevent users from starting the service, identify peak hour intervals for our service so we can have the infrastructure scaled to meet the requests, etc.

In March 2012, CyberGhost had successfully passed an audit and verification conducted by QSCert for the implemented Information Safety Management System (ISMS) according to the international industrial standards ISO27001 and ISO9001. The certification confirms the high quality of the internal safety processes and is renewed yearly ever since. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with the Website is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account has been compromised), please contact us immediately.

During the development of the Service and the selection of its service providers, CyberGhost has paid attention to providing a high degree of safety:

All data processing centers with which CyberGhost cooperates pass through a compliance process. CyberGhost has generally Root Access to all its servers and administers them itself.
