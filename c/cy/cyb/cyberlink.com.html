			  </li>
				<li><strong>Third Party Advertisers /Interest-Based Ads</strong><br>
				CyberLink allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks like Google, to display and/or serve advertisements within the Website. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser the advertisements and links that appear on the website. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, or JavaScript) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the content you see. However, please note that if an advertiser requires CyberLink to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 28 - 40) or audience segment (for example, women in California who viewed certain content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you have the characteristics of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Website, Mobile App and Computer Software, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you. The information will be recorded and anonymized by the Third Party Advertisers by means of a series of non-reversible encoding functions. Where we provide you with interest-based ads on a website other than our own, we do not track your other activities on that website, if you click on our ads, we will know only the domain you came from. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt out, once you have opted in, of certain practices. <br>
				CyberLink's Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control.<br>
				If you do not want us to use your Information in this way, you can simply choose not to give your permission on the websites which we collect your information. Please note that in some regions this may involve un-checking a box. You can also exercise this right at any time by unsubscribing the same. <br>
				We implement Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), to support Google features such as Display Advertising, Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. We use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online, Google uses cookies to inform, optimize and serve ads based on your past visits to our Website, and also to report how our ad impressions, uses of ad services are related to your visits to our Website. Google may show our ads on websites across the internet you use.
