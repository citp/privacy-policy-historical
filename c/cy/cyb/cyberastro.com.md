This document is rather long because we want to give our users all the facts about our privacy policy. The items below provide an index to the information that follows: 

**What personal information do we collect?**

**Registration Data**

During membership registration, Cyber Astro collects personal information including your name, gender, and email address, your current hometown and birth data information including your time of birth. This information is used strictly to generate your personal horoscopes online. Your email address is used to identify your unique birth data record in the database, since an email address is always unique and has no duplicates. You do not have to provide any personal information to use Cyber Astro’s services. However, if you choose not to become a member of Club CyberAstro, we may not be able to provide you with some of the other services dependent upon the collection of such information, such as your personalized free predictions.

**Through Log Files**

Our server and statistics server capture information to gather broad demographic information that is not personal. We track the IP address of visitors to the site to find out demographically which parts of the world our traffic comes from. We collect browser types used and access times to analyze trends, administer the site, track users movements within the site to find out what services are most appealing. All of this information is used for gathering broad demographic data to enhance the performance and services of the site.

**Through Order Forms**

For our paid personalized services we gather basically the information needed for fulfillment of the service. This is held in strict confidence, as explained earlier. We guarantee complete confidentiality of our members’ identity, horoscope details and the prediction details. Cyber Astro, Ltd. further guarantees that no direct or indirect use will be made by Cyber Astro about any aspect of life, as revealed in the horoscope of a member, except for the explicit purpose of communicating the horoscope charts and predictions back to the member.

For payment of the paid services, we use two independent secure server companies, Bank Card USA for International Cards and Payseal of ICICI Bank Ltd. for Indian Credit cards. Your credit card information, as well as your address for address verification is collected by this company on their website and Cyber Astro, Ltd. has no access to this information.

**Other information that we may collect**

Any other information we may have for you, comes from actual email or other contact you may have made with us in regard to specific services or products. As a general rule, these are not made part of your member profile, and are used only to address your specific need or concern that you may have communicated to us on. Although we give you the option to tell your friends about our site, we do not monitor or keep any record of friends you may contact. Information gathered on our “Affiliate with Us”, is used primarily for a Business-to-Business purpose and to encourage inquiries from other web sites that might be interested in obtaining our Astrology Content for their own site. Information from “Advertise with Us” similarly is used to generate interest in other sites or companies that may wish to purchase banner advertising on our site.
