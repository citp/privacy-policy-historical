# Privacy

### Information

When you make purchase requests, we do collect and store the names, addresses, credit card numbers and other personally-identifying information from you. We use this information to process your orders, to keep you updated on your orders and to personalize your shopping experience. This information is saved in a secure environment and is kept for our records and to make it easier for you to use our service on return visits. We do not reveal your name, address, credit card number or other personal-identifying information to any third parties or let the information become accessible to the general public without your consent.

### Cookie Usage

A "cookie" is a small piece of information which a web server can store temporarily with your web browser. This is useful for having your web browser remember some specific information which our web server can later retrieve. We use cookies to maintain the state of your shopping cart and the checkout process. We do not collect your personal information from your computer nor track your browsing behavior. We also never share any information about you and your orders with other parties.

The cookie file is NOT a secret way for our web server to find out everything about you and what is on your hard drive. There is absolutely no way for our web server to gain access to any private information about you or your computer system which you do not wish to reveal. There is no possible way that a virus could be spread through the use of cookies.

Please make sure your browser is able to accept cookies from our website (see your web browser's help or manual to learn how). Some programs you installed on your system might interfere/change the cookie management of your browser/system. Please make sure you set up those programs correctly to allow cookies from us. Please consult the program's help or manual on this matter.

### Security

CyberPower is committed to taking reasonable steps to ensure the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Your credit card security is our highest priority. CyberPower utilizes Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, an advanced encryption technology that protects the information you send us against unauthorized access. This safeguard has helped, in many cases, to make shopping on the Internet significantly safer than using your credit card at a restaurant or department store

If you have any question regarding our online security and privacy, you may contact us at [cyberpower@cyberpowersystem.co.uk.](mailto:cyberpower@cyberpowersystem.co.uk)
