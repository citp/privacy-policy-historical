We use this information to process your orders, to keep you updated on your orders and to personalize your shopping experience. This information is saved in a secure environment and is kept for our records and to make it easier for you to use our service on return visits. We do not reveal your name, address, credit card number or other personal-identifying information to any third parties or let the information become accessible to the general public without your consent.

### Cookie Usage

A "cookie" is a small piece of information which a web server can store information temporarily with your web browser. This is useful for having your web browser remember some specific information which our web server can later retrieve. One purpose of these technologies is to help us better understand the user’s behavior and which part of our website is frequented the most. Cyberpower and its partners use cookies to measure the effectiveness of our ad campaigns and promotions. This allows us to provide special promotions and deals that our customers would find the most interest in.

Cyberpower and our partners also employ the use of cookies that are essential to the shopping experience of our website. These cookies are used to maintain the state of your shopping cart and to complete the checkout process. Our goal in these cases is to make your shopping experience with Cyberpower more convenient. For example, we use cookies to store the customer’s shopping cart so they may complete their shopping experience. If the customer leaves our website and comes back at a later time, we are able to restore any preexisting configurations that the customer has been working on and allows our customer resume where they left off. In addition, we also employ cookies from our partners to combat fraudulent charges during our checkout process. This allows us to expedite our order processing and verification process once your order is submitted to us.

### Security

CyberPower is committed to taking reasonable steps to ensure the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Your credit card security is our highest priority. CyberPower utilizes Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, an advanced encryption technology that protects the information you send us against unauthorized access. This safeguard has helped, in many cases, to make shopping on the Internet significantly safer than using your credit card at a restaurant or department store
