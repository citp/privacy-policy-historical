There are two easy ways to tell if your browser is using a secure connection. One way is to look for a locked padlock icon at the bottom of your browser window. 

Another way is to look for the change from the normal "http:" to "https" at the beginning of the web page address. The "s" indicates a secure connection. When you see the locked padlock or the "s" you can be 100% sure that your online data is secure!
