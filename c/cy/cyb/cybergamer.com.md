Privacy Policy

Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.

Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected.

We will collect and use of personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law. 

We will only retain personal information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes. 

We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned. 

Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date. 

We will protect personal information by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information. 

We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained. 

**Additionally**

CyberGamer is a public system and content residing on this system is openly viewable over the internet, such as your online/offline, 'last online' statuses and your real name and most of your profile details. Users who post or send personal or security information through any of the CyberGamer systems do so at their own risk. Posting or transmitting any user's personal information via the CyberGamer system is strictly prohibited and penalties for breaches of this will be severe. It is irresponsible to post any users personal details on a public forum and a risk to the user's personal safety, whilst CyberGamer staff understand this and will move to act promptly on any breaches delays may be incurred before the removal of such content. We take this matter seriously and welcome all users to submit a support ticket if any of their personal details are posted on the public forum by another user.
