Lets Play Live Media Limited (LPL)  
Privacy Policy 

Plain English Terms  
The General Terms below are complicated legal terms that serve to protect us and make it clear the privacy terms that will apply to users of LPL services. These terms below are here to give you a simple explanation of what the General Terms really mean in plain English.

However, these plain English terms are not legally binding and the General Terms are still the legal terms that will apply if anything goes wrong.

Personal Information: LPL stores your Personal Information when you use our service. Because we keep this information, LPL takes on the legal responsibilities that come with storing that information.  
Your Rights: You have rights to be able to access, amend and delete your Personal Information on request.  
Log data: When you visit our service, LPL collects data that your browser sends to us. This includes IP address, browser version, time and date of visit, and other statistics.  
Cookies: Our service uses cookies to collect data and improve itself. You can either accept or refuse these cookies and know when it is being sent to you. If you refuse, you might not be able to use some parts of our service.  
Security: LPL's data is encrypted and securely stored via Amazon Web Services (AWS) storage and database services. All passwords are hashed, so no one is able to view them, including LPL.  
Social Media and other Links: When you click on a third-party link to another site that is not operated by us, we have no control over or responsibility for the content or privacy policies of these other sites.   
Age Restriction: Those under the age of 13 are not able to access the Service. If someone under 13 years of age provides us with any information, we will immediately delete it and remove that person's consent.

This Privacy Policy applies to persons subscribing to the Insider's Guide (IG) and those participating in LPL tournaments (Users) via the internet website[ https://letsplay.live/](https://letsplay.live/) (Website).

This privacy policy is used to inform you of LPL’s policies relating to the use and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service. When we talk about Personal Information, we mean information relating to you or other identifiable individuals.

By using the Service, you agree to be bound by the terms of the then current privacy policy (Privacy Policy). LPL reserves the right, at any time, to modify or replace this Privacy Policy.

Your use of the Service following the posting of any changes to the Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of those changes.

For the subscription to LPL's tournament platform, LPL uses the so-called double opt in procedure, i.e. the registration is not complete until the user has confirmed his or her registration by clicking on the link contained in a confirmation email sent to his or her for this purpose. If the User does not confirm the subscription, his or her subscription to LPL platform will automatically be deleted from LPL's database.

In order to determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the following factors; the amount, nature and sensitivity of the data, potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.  
We may retain certain information subsequent to the termination of your account, for example if it is necessary to fulfil our legal obligations or to exercise, to maintain security, to prevent fraud and abuse and to defend or enforce our rights.
