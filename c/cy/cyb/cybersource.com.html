	 <p>(Revision August 20, 2009)</p>
<p>As a leading provider of payment management and risk management services to hundreds of thousands of online businesses around the world, privacy and data protection are of the utmost importance to CyberSource Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Authorize.Net LLC, CyberSource Ltd., CyberSource NI Ltd., CYBS Singapore Pte Ltd., CyberSource K.K., and other subsidiaries (collectively "CyberSource"). This Privacy Statement for CyberSource ("Privacy Statement") details the company's policies with respect to the handling of personally identifiable information ("Information") submitted by the reader of this Privacy Policy ("You") or otherwise collected by CyberSource via the company's website or in the course of providing services to CyberSource's customers. CyberSource will use and disclose Information only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement.</p>
<h2>A. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION </h2>
<p>The type of Information submitted to or collected by CyberSource varies depending upon the nature of the activity and relationship with CyberSource.</p>
<ol type="">
<li><u>Browsing the Website</u>: When You browse the company's website, CyberSource may collect information regarding the domain and host from which You access the Internet, the Internet Protocol address of the computer or Internet Service Provider You are using, and anonymous site statistical data. This information is collected for the purpose of assessing the effectiveness of the company's website and for security reasons.</li>
<li><u>Inquiries</u>: The website contains various forms, links to company e-mail addresses, and fax numbers that You may use to solicit information about the website, CyberSource services, and the company in general. When You complete and submit a form, send us an e-mail, send us a fax, or contact us by telephone, CyberSource may store the inquiries and their contents, including any personally identifiable information You may have provided. Any personally identifiable information You submit via an inquiry is collected only with Your knowledge and active participation.</li>
<li><u>Use of Gateway Services</u>: When You register to use CyberSource online processing services ("Gateway Services"), You will be required to provide personally identifiable information and to enter into a written agreement with CyberSource. If You ordered any products or services from businesses that use our Gateway Services ("CyberSource Customers"), You were required to submit personally identifiable information ("Order Information"). CyberSource Customers transmit Order Information to CyberSource for the purpose of processing Orders. Order Information is maintained in servers located within the U.S.A. and may also be maintained in servers located in Europe or Asia, depending on where the order originates or the geographic location of a CyberSource Customer.  CyberSource may maintain Order Information for a certain period of time to comply with audits or for disaster recovery purposes.</li>
<li><u>Applying for a Merchant Account</u>: When You submit an application to obtain a merchant account through CyberSource, You will be required to provide personally identifiable information. Furthermore, CyberSource may also obtain information about You from third party sources, including, without limitation, consumer reporting agencies.</li>
<li><u>Notice for European Users</u>: The Data Protection Act puts obligations on users of personal information and sets forth principles for its use. One principle states that information must be processed fairly and lawfully. This means that You are entitled to know how we intend to use any information You provide. You can then decide whether You want to give personal information to us. Details are publicly available at www.ico.gov.uk or from:<br>
