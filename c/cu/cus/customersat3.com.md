## **Two Main Categories of Confirmit Sites**

Confirmit runs two main categories of Internet sites:

  1. For the **_first category_** , Confirmit acts as a SaaS provider for companies conducting data collection and reporting activities via the Internet. You may be submitting responses to web surveys, and the template of the survey may state "Powered by Confirmit". Web surveys launched by Confirmit Customers may be hosted on Confirmit's SaaS environments, or alternatively they may be hosted on customer's own hosting environment (www-addresses other than Confirmit’s). In any of these cases, please be aware that it is our customers who are initiating or performing the data collection, and it is therefore our customers who instruct Confirmit who to collect data from, and it is our customers who control the use the collected data. Confirmit is acting as a data processor (as defined in the EU Data Protection Directive), whereas our customer is the data controller. For more details about how our customer intends to use your data, please refer to the privacy policy of the Confirmit customer from whom the e-mail and web survey originate. For more information related to our role as a data processor, please see the “Additional Information” section below.

NOTE: For information about cookies when you use our SaaS environment, please refer to our [Cookie Policy](http://www.confirmit.com/cookie-policy/). We do not use cookies in surveys you are invited to take via an e-mail invitation with a clickable link, or via pop-ups, but the party delivering the survey to you may.

  2. The **_second category_** of sites we manage is related to information offered by Confirmit to customers, prospects, and other visitors (the Confirmit website, the Confirmit Extranet, etc).



The remainder of this policy is related to this latter type of sites.

You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address or e-mail id, zip code, resume, and additional contact information such as your phone number.  We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes.
