**What do we mean by Personal Information?**

In this Policy, personal information means information or an information set that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Customer360 to identify an individual and includes Personal Data as such term is defined in our Terms. Except as described in this Policy, Customer360 will not give, sell, rent or loan any personal information to any third party.

Personal information does not include Usage Data which we define as encoded or anonymized information or aggregated data we collect about a group or category of services, features or users which does not contain personally identifying information. Usage Data helps us understand trends in usage of the Service so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the Service. In addition to collecting and using Usage Data ourselves, we may share Usage Data with third parties, including our customers, partners and service providers, for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customers needs and improve the Service as well as for advertising and marketing purposes. We do not share Usage Data with third parties in a way that would enable them to identify you personally.

### **How Do We Collect, Use and Share Your Personal Information and Other Information?**

**Information You Provide to Us**

When you register for the Service, we ask for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information, as well as certain related information like your company name and website name. We also collect personal information such as an email address and a name or alias of any agents or end users you authorize to log into and utilize the Service in connection with your account and a password from these Agents when they first access the service. If you sign-up for a 30-day free trial account, you are not required to enter your credit card information unless and until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to the Service. Customer360 uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information for any purpose except for credit card processing on Customer360’s behalf.

Customer360 may use the personal information provided to operate the Service and tailor its customers needs, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact and communicate with you and your Agents about the Service and your and their use of the Service, send marketing materials (subject to your opt-out option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service.

Customer360 may also share personal information with its third-party service providers (such as its credit card processors and hosting partners) to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other services we use to operate the Service and maintain a high quality user experience. We do not permit our service providers to use the personal information we share for their marketing purposes.

**Log Files**

As is true with most websites, Customer360 gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. Occasionally, we may connect personal information to information gathered in our log files, as necessary to improve the Service for individual customers. Otherwise, we generally use this information as we would any Usage Data, to analyze trends, administer and maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service.

**Cookies**

The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify a users computer and web browser, and tailor web pages and/or login information to their preferences. Cookies help us promptly display the information needed to use the capabilities of the Service and other information which we consider to be of interest to visitors to the Customer360 Websites and users of the Service. By gathering and remembering information about website preferences through cookies, we can provide a better web and marketing experience. Cookies don’t give us access to users computers, and the information we collect through cookies doesn’t include personal information.

When your agents or end users use the Service we utilize session cookies which allow us to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your online transactions. Session cookies disappear from your computer when the web browser is closed or computer is turned off. We also utilize persistent cookies to identify Customer360 Agents and End Users and make it easier for them to log into and use the Service. Persistent cookies remain on computers after the web browser is closed or the computer is turned off.

We utilize various categories of cookies, which are summarized below along with the options available to you to manage them.

**Essential:** Essential cookies are those that are critical to the functionality of the Service. We use these cookies to keep an agent or end user logged into the Service and remember relevant information when the agent or end user returns to the Service.

This information does not include personal information though we may reassociate this information with personal information we have collected when it is received. Marketing cookies are also used to track the performance of our advertisements and are employed by third party advertising networks that we utilize.

Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of internet users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a users computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites. We tie the information gathered by web beacons to personal information we otherwise collect, and use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns as well as to operate and improve the Service. You can opt-out of these emails by following the unsubscribe instructions within such marketing emails.

**Do Not Track Signals**

We do not currently respond to web browsers Do Not Track signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection information about visitors activities on the Customer360 Website and Service, and across other websites. If we do so in the future, we will provide all relevant information in this Policy.

**Other Information Sharing**

We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.

We may share information, including personal information with any member of the Customer360 Group, which includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or under common control with Customer360, Inc.

**Links to Other Websites**

The Service contains links to websites and applications other than the Service, including websites and applications operated by affiliates and other third parties (Third Party). Please be aware that we do not determine and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of websites and applications operated by Third Parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service, and read the privacy statements of Third Party websites and applications linked to the Service. Customer360 does not endorse and is not responsible for the practices of these Third Parties or their websites or applications. This Policy applies only to information collected by the Service.

**Public Forums**

The Service (including the Customer360 Websites) offers publicly-accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information provided in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.

**Customer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews**

From time to time, we post customer testimonials on the Customer360 Websites which may contain personal information. We obtain the customers consent to post their names along with their testimonials.

**Protection of Information**

Customer360 is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. We utilize robust precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information within the Service, by employing technological, physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully-developed security procedures. For example, when you enter confidential information (such as login credentials or information submitted from within the Service) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures are used in an effort to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you authorized to access your data. However, no internet, e-mail or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take care in deciding what information you send to us in this way.

**Safe Harbor Data Privacy Notice**

Customer360 complies with the US  EU and US  Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for protecting the privacy of data flowing from the EU and Switzerland to the United States, as set forth by the US Department of Commerce.

We frequently enter agreements with our EU customers to provide them access to our Service, which includes the processing of information relating their customers. In providing our Service, we do not own, control or direct the use of the information stored or processed on our platform at the direction of our customers, and in fact we are largely unaware of what information is being stored on our platform and only access such information as reasonably necessary to provide the Service (including to respond to support requests), as otherwise authorized by our customers or as required by law. We are the data processors and not the data controllers of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU Directive on Data Protection (Directive 95/46/EC) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection. Our EU or Swiss based customers, who control their customer data and send it to Customer360 for processing, are the controllers of that data and are responsible for compliance with the Directive. In particular, Customer360’s customers are responsible for complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the relevant EU member state before sending personal information to Customer360 for processing. We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.

As the processors of personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control to the extent consistent with the functionality of our Service. In doing so, we implement technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information as more fully described above under Protection of Information.

**Hosting and Data Transfer**

We are based in the United States, but, unless we expressly agree otherwise (including through our Terms), we may host and process data, including personal information, in the United States and in other countries through the Customer360 Group and third parties that we use to operate and manage the Service. When you access or use the Service, or otherwise provide information to us, you are consenting, on behalf of you and your authorized Agents or End-Users, (and representing that you have the authority to provide such consent) to the processing and transfer of information in and to the United States and other countries which may have different privacy laws from your or their country of residence.

**Choice**

We process and store information on behalf of our customers. If you are an individual interacting with a customer of the Service and would no longer like to be contacted by that customer, please contact that customer directly. If you are a Customer360 customer and would like to opt-out of getting marketing communications from Customer360 please contact us at privacy@customer360.co or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email. Requests to opt-out of transfers to our third-party vendors may also be submitted, but limitations on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible to provide the Service in this manner.

**Correcting and Updating Your Information**

Customers may update or change the personal information they have provided Customer360 by logging into the Service and providing such additional information where applicable. If you are our customer and would like to gain access to, or request deletion of information we have collected as data controllers please contact us at privacy@customer360.co. We will respond to such queries within 30 business days.

Customer360 has no direct relationship with the individuals with whom our customers may interact using the Service. Any such individual seeking access to, or who would like to correct, amend, or delete data which may be stored in the Service should direct his query to the applicable Customer360 customer acting as the data controller for such information.

**Data Retention**

Customer360 will retain personal information we process on behalf of our customers or collect directly from our customers for as long as needed to provide Service to our customers, subject to our compliance with this Policy. We may further retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, maintain accurate accounting, financial and other operational records, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We have established internal policies for the deletion of data from customer accounts following termination of a customers subscription to the Service.

**Childrens Personal Information**

Customer360 does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through our Service. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their childrens Internet usage and to help enforce our Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information on our Service without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to Customer360 through our Service, please contact us, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that information from our databases.

**Changes to the Privacy Policy**

If we make any material changes to this Policy, we will notify you by email or by posting a prominent notice on the Customer360 Websites prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to be bound by such changes to this Policy.
