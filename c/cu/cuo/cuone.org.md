### Privacy Statement for  
Credit Union ONE

  
_Your Credit Union's Assurance to your Privacy_

We know how important it is to you, our member, that your personal information maintained by Credit Union ONE remains safe and secure. Be assured, your credit union is committed to protecting your privacy, whether you conduct business with us by telephone, U.S. Mail, in person at one of our branch retail outlets or electronically via the Internet, ATM network, Compu-Phone, or CU@Home (Home Banking). We respect your right to confidentiality and continuously take every possible measure to ensure that your personal information remains just that, confidential.

All Credit Union ONE employees are required to adhere to our Confidentiality/Nondisclosure Agreement, which includes maintaining the confidentiality of all credit union and member information. We do not collect or maintain information about our members that is not essential for prudent business purposes.

**_Credit Union ONE does not disclose information about our members or former members to third parties except as permitted or required by law._**

_How we collect information_

We collect information such as name, address, social security number, and assets and income directly from our members through membership applications, account and service applications, loan applications and related forms that you complete. We obtain information when verifying the information you provide on an application or other form, such as from your current or past employers or, from other institutions where you conduct financial transactions, and information, such as your account balances, payment history, parties to transactions, credit card usage and from your transactions with us. In addition, we obtain information regarding your creditworthiness and credit history from credit reporting agencies in connection with making loan decisions, making, servicing and collecting loans, and granting checking accounts and ATM/Debit card privileges. Information obtained from our members is kept secure and access to that information is limited within the credit union to personnel who need to know the information to provide products or services to our members and properly operate the credit union.

_How we use collected information_

We may disclose information we collect from membership and loan applications and other forms to our affiliated companies, such as: 

  * ONE's Financial Services, Inc 
  * ONE's Technologies, Inc. 
  * to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf 
  * to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements, and 
  * to other related business partners 

The types of information we disclose may include, for example, your name, address, social security number, and income. Member information is provided to business partners in connection with statement and mailing distribution, after-hours and automated services, credit card authorizations, guaranteeing member checks, and reporting credit history information to credit reporting agencies.

Credit Union ONE requires all recipients of nonpublic, personal information to adhere to our strict confidentiality and privacy policies. Federal law protects the information Credit Union ONE provides to credit reporting agencies and its use is strictly governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. We may also disclose information we collect about you under other circumstances as permitted or required by law. These typically include information to process transactions on your behalf, conduct the operations of the credit union, follow your instructions as you authorize or protect the security of our financial records.
