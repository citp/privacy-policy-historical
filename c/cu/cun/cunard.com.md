# Privacy policy

### Information We Collect or Store Automatically as You Access and Use the Sites.

We automatically collect certain type of usage information when you visit the Sites, receive Cunard Line emails, or otherwise engage with us. For example, we use cookies, log file information, clear gifs or beacons, device recognition technologies and other similar tracking technology to better understand our Site usage information and to improve our Site and our user experience. We may use these technologies to collect the type of device you use to access our Sites, your device identifier, IP address or mobile operating system. If you use our website, we may collect information about the browser you are using. We might look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us. We may collect this information over time and across different websites, apps and devices. Third parties may also collect your personal information this way when you use the Sites. Some methods we use to collect this usage information is explained below.

To learn how to manage how we – and our vendors – use cookies and other tracking tools, and to read our Do Not Track policy, visit the [About Our Ads](https://www.cunard.com/en-us/advice-and-policies/about-our-ads) page.

_Cookies_ help personalize your online experience, such as recognizing your name when you revisit, your language and country, as well as to assist us in marketing and advertising. A cookie is a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters placed on your devices that uniquely identify your browser and let us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Site. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Some cookies are deleted once you leave our website ("session cookies"), while other cookies remain after you leave our website ("persistent cookies") so that you are recognized when you return to the website.

_Log File Information_ may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, information about your mobile device, referring/exit pages and URL’s, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Sites, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

_Clear gifs (also known as web beacons)_ are small graphic images or other web programming code that may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our customers, and can also be included in Cunard Line e-mails, so that we can determine which e-mails from Cunard Line are opened and which links or advertisements in those e-mails are clicked by recipients, and to help identify our users’ agreed devices.

_Embedded scripts_ are a type of programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

_Browser fingerprinting_ includes collection and analysis of information from your device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts, and other data, for purposes of identifying your browser and device.

_Entity tags (“ETags”)_ are a feature of the cache of information from device browsers. ETags are an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of resources found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner, ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.

_Recognition technologies_ apply statistical probability tools to data sets in an attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices. This information helps us to identify you across multiple devices that you may use, analyze and improve the Sites and present you with information based on these assumptions.
