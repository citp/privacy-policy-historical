<h2>Information Collected and Stored Automatically</h2>
<h3 class="low-black">Cookies</h3>

Session cookies created on your computer by CUNY servers do not contain personal information. We may use a session cookie to store a randomly generated identifying tag on your computer. Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted during operation of your browser or when your browser is closed.</p>
<p>If you register to personalize cuny.edu you will be asked for permission to store a ''persistent'' cookie on your computer's hard drive. This permanent cookie will allow the web site to recognize you and your access privileges when you visit again, and to tailor the information presented to you. CUNY uses persistent cookies only with your permission.</p>
<p>Most web browsers may be customized to refuse new cookies or delete existing cookies. Rejecting or deleting cookies may limit your ability to take advantage of some features of this web site and could result in the loss of any customized setting.</p>
