                LogMeIn, Inc. ("LogMeIn"), respects your privacy and is committed to protect the
                personal information that you share with us. Generally, you can browse through our
                website without giving us any information about yourself. This policy describes
                how we collect and use your personal information when we need your personal information
                to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your
                personal information through our LogMeIn.com website.</p>
            <h2 class="color-dark-green">
                Information Collection</h2>
            <p>
                Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual,
                including, but not limited to, a first and last name, company name, email address,
                telephone number, postal or other physical address, birth date, gender, occupation,
                a credit card number (including expiration date) to process payment for products
                and/or services and such other information when needed to provide a service that
                you requested. Certain of our product and services also store connection or session
                information such as time/date and length of collection, IP address, chat logs and
                technician information. As you navigate through this site, certain anonymous information
                can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the
                information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web beacons,
                and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). Your internet
                browser automatically transmits to this site some of this anonymous information,
                such as the URL of the web site you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP)
                address and the browser version your computer is currently using; the date and time
                you access the site and the pages that you access while at the site. This information
                is used for internal/external marketing purposes, to analyze trends and to improve
                the site. This site may also collect anonymous information from your computer through
                cookies and internet tags or web beacons. You may set your browser to notify you
                when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of this
                site might not work without cookies. LogMeIn collects personal information when
                you elect to use our software on a free trial basis or purchase a license or an
                upgrade. LogMeIn only uses such information if it has been collected in accordance
                with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Policy and applicable laws.</p>
            <h2 class="color-dark-green">
                Choice/Opt-Out</h2>
            <p>
                You may elect to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing or market research information.
                This means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information
                in accordance with this Policy unless you take affirmative action to opt out at
                the point of collection. Opt-out is the means by which you give us, or decline to
                give us, your consent to use your personal information for the purposes covered
                by the opt-out choice. You may opt out at the point of collection when personal
                information is collected, or you may do so at any time by sending an email request
                to support@LogMeIn.com (please indicate "Opt Out" in the subject line) or by sending
                a written request to the address provided below. In some cases, we will provide
                you with the opportunity to "opt in". This means we will require your affirmative
                action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other
                than the purpose for which it was submitted.</p>

                can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your
                hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies save you time, for
                example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a Site, a cookie recalls
                your specific information on subsequent visits. LogMeIn's website also uses cookies
                to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness
                of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational
                structure is in helping users reach that information. You may accept or decline
                cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, however you can modify
                your browser setting to decline cookies. In addition to cookies, our site uses a
                variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including web beacons. Web beacons
                are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of web sites.
                LogMeIn's also uses these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our
                web site, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our
                web site.</p>
            <h2 class="color-dark-green">
                How We Use Information Collected</h2>
