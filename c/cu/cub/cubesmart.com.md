**CubeSmart, Inc. Privacy Statement**

CubeSmart, Inc. is committed to protecting your privacy. We have provided this notice to explain our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

We work hard to keep our web site up-to-date. As our web site changes, our information collection practices may change as well. Such changes may necessitate updates to this privacy policy. We encourage you to return to this area periodically to check for updates.

**How and What We Collect**  
We collect information needed to complete your purchase, which typically includes such contact information as e-mail address, first and last name, street address, and telephone number. We do not store financial information on our site. Credit Card information is sent directly to the Credit Card verification service (Authorize.Net) over a secure SSL connection and only the last 4 digits of your credit card number is available to CubeSmart employees (for billing inquires). On any information collection area we will indicate what information is required in order for us to process your request.

Like most Internet sites, we collect some passive information from our visitors in order to properly maintain our site and determine what areas are more popular than others. We use passive tracking mechanisms to compile statistics that show, for example, the daily number of visitors to our sites. These statistics are used internally to better design our web sites and provide services to the public.

**How Your Information Is Used**  
We use the information you provide to respond to your particular request, for example, to send you information in which you expressed an interest; to fulfill your order; or to notify you of the status of your order. We will also use your contact information to tell you about other products or services in which you believe you may be interested. We will also disclose your information if required by law to do so.

**The Choices You have About Our Use of Your  
Information and How to Contact Us at CubeSmart**  
If you find that information you have provided to us in connection with a particular product purchase is incorrect, you can edit your CubeSmart information at any time by contacting web@cubedoor.com.

If you do not wish to receive information from us or third parties we select, please contact us at web@cubedoor.com. In some cases, when purchasing a product, we may ask you whether you would like further information sent to you. If you choose "Yes," you are giving us permission to send you notifications of special CubeSmart products and updates. If you do not want to receive any further information from CubeSmart or to have your personal information released to third parties, please choose "No."

We provide you with the ability to contact us about standard questions you may have at the "Contact Us" area of our site. If you have any questions that do not fall into one of those categories, or have other questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:

**How We Maintain the Security of Your Information**  
We use standard industry practices, including storage of data in password protected files, to maintain the security and integrity of your information. We collect purchase information over a secure Internet connection (SSL). In addition, once received, only employees who need to view your information have access to these files. We do not collect financial or other "sensitive" information on our web site. Please remember that, ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal registration information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.
