This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by Cubebrush Labs when you use the Cubebrush Service, how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in our <a href="/terms" target="_self">Terms of Use</a>.</p></li><li class="tc-item" data-anchor="information_we_collect"><label class="tc-item-label">Information We Collect</label><p class="tc-text"><strong>User-Provided Information:&nbsp;</strong> You provide us information about yourself, such as your name, e-mail address, and other personal information if you register for a User account with the Service (including by "following," "liking," adding the Cubebrush application, linking your account to the Cubebrush service, etc., on a third party website or network). If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service. You may provide us information in User Content you post to the Service. </p><p class="tc-text"><strong>Cookies Information:&nbsp;</strong> When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Cubebrush help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information about how you browse the Service to us. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. </p><p class="tc-text"><strong>Log File Information:&nbsp;</strong> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. </p><p class="tc-text"><strong>Clear Gifs Information:&nbsp;</strong> When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Cubebrush better for our users. </p><p class="tc-text"><strong>Third Party Services:&nbsp;</strong> Cubebrush uses third party analytics services including Google Analytics to help understand use of the Service. These services collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address, and their use of this information is governed by their Privacy Policy. </p></li><li class="tc-item" data-anchor="how_we_use_your_information"><label class="tc-item-label">How We Use Your Information</label><p class="tc-text">We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. </p><p class="tc-text">By providing us with your email address (including by "following," "liking," adding the Cubebrush application, linking your account to the Cubebrush service, etc., on a third party website or network), you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. You also agree that we may send you notifications of activity on the Service to the email address you give us, in accordance with any applicable privacy settings. We may use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your account settings page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails. </p><p class="tc-text">Following termination or deactivation of your User account, we may retain your profile information and User Content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. Furthermore, we may retain and continue to use indefinitely all information (including User Content) contained in your communications to other Users or posted to public or semi-public areas of the Service after termination or deactivation of your User account. </p><p class="tc-text">If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to the Service, we will ask you for that person's email address and automatically send an email invitation. We store this information to send this email, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database at <a href="mailto:info@cubebrush.co">info@cubebrush.co</a>.</p><p class="tc-text">We may use certain information about you and/or your User Content internally for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content. </p><p class="tc-text">We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our Users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (h) track User Content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; and (i) automatically update the Cubebrush application on your system and related devices. </p></li><li class="tc-item" data-anchor="how_we_share_your_information"><label class="tc-item-label">How We Share Your Information</label><p class="tc-text">Personally Identifiable Information: We will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others under any circumstances. We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties (e.g. payment processors) for the purpose of providing the Service to you. If we do this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside of our direct control (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). </p><p class="tc-text">As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution. </p><p class="tc-text">Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings.

If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information. </p><p class="tc-text">From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities ("Events") on the Service together with a third party partner. If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties' use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events. </p><p class="tc-text">Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our <a href="/terms" target="_self">Terms of Use</a>, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Cubebrush or Cubebrush Labs, our Users or others. </p><p class="tc-text">Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Cubebrush services. </p><p class="tc-text">We may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Cubebrush. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. Cubebrush does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Cubebrush to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The Cubebrush Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information. </p></li><li class="tc-item" data-anchor="how_we_protect_your_information"><label class="tc-item-label">How We Protect Your Information</label><p class="tc-text">We care about the integrity and security of your personal information.
