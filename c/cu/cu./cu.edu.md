## What information does the University collect?

You may access most System Administration websites without providing personal information, however you may need to provide personal information to use certain services. The amount and type of personal information required to use these services varies. It is the practice of System Administration to collect the least amount of personal information necessary to provide services to you and to meet any legal obligations.

## How does System Administration collect this information?

You provide most of the personal information that System Administration collects when you use our services.  However, in some cases, we may collect publicly available information and/or information from a third party that has the authority to share your personal information with the University. For example, System Administration may receive personal information about you through the Common App college application system.

The collection of non-personal usage information occurs automatically when individuals use System Administration websites and applications. This information may be collected using third-party services like Google Analytics and using techniques including web browser cookies.

## How does System Administration use this information?

Examples of how System Administration uses personal and usage information include:

  * Providing and improving services to our students, employees and other community members. This includes, but is not limited to, the accessing and processing of: 
    *   Personal information related to services and tools that support admission applications, online learning, student and employee self-service, course and degree management, financial aid management, personnel management, research administration, event management and ticketing, academic advising, housing and dining services, public safety, communication with employees and students, etc.

In general, information is used and stored within the United States. In some cases, third-party services may require the use and storage of information outside of the United States.

## How does System Administration share my information?

System Administration may share personal information within the University of Colorado (including with University of Colorado campuses) and with the University of Colorado's third-party partners. However, the University restricts access to personal information to individuals and groups who have a legitimate need to access the data.

When appropriate, System Administration may share your personal information with third parties. To the extent possible, we require these individuals and organizations to protect your information through contracts and may perform our own security assessments or rely on third-party assessments.

Some examples of situations when System Administration may provide personal information to third parties include:

  * When using the services from third-party vendors, consultants and other service providers who do work for the University and need access to your information to do that work.
  * If you request that someone within the University of Colorado shares your information.
  * To report information to government or accrediting agencies that regulate the University’s business.
  * With the University of Colorado Foundation for the purposes of fundraising or processing donations.
  * To comply with applicable law and our legal obligations, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process.

  * When the University of Colorado believes in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect its rights, your safety or the safety of others.
  * To investigate potential crimes, fraud or to respond to a government request. 



**Public Records Law.**   As a public institution, the University must comply with the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA).  Information we handle, including your personal information, may be available for request under CORA if it is not protected under other law or specifically exempt from disclosure under CORA.  We will not disclose information protected by law in response to a public records request. 

## How does System Administration protect my information?

System Administration has security policies and standards regarding the protection of personal information. These standards include both administrative and technical requirements to appropriately protect personal information. System Administration has an information security officer and team who assist departments in providing appropriate protection for personal information. This includes active monitoring and assessments to detect potential security issues. Additionally, the University of Colorado has an internal audit team that periodically performs security related audits.

When third parties handle your information, System Administration relies on a combination of contractual requirements, third-party audits, security reviews and assessments and as assurances that personal information is appropriately protected.

You can review this policy and the retention schedules here: [https://www.cu.edu/ope/aps/2006](https://web.archive.org/ope/aps/2006).

## What rights do I have regarding my personal information?

The rights you have regarding the use and disclosure of your personal information depend on the nature of your relationship to the University of Colorado, applicable law, and the type of the information the University holds about you.  Please be aware that personal information rights under international, United States, and Colorado information and privacy laws may differ.

  * Provide a list of the types of the personal information System Administration has about you within its primary systems.
  * Correct inaccurate information about you (For example, updates to your name, contact information, etc.)
  * Delete information about you stored in one of System Administration’s primary systems.
