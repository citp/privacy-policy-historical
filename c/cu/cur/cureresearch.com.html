<h1><font face="verdana,arial,geneva" size="4">Privacy Statement</font></h1>


<p><i>Adviware</i> recognises and values the protection of your personal information. <i>Adviware</i> also recognises our customers’ concerns about the collection of any personal information and how <i>Adviware</i> will use that information.  <i>Adviware</i> observes and is governed by the National Privacy Principles pursuant to the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). <i>Adviware</i> has implemented this privacy policy in order to reassure our customers about how <i>Adviware</i> will use any collected personal information.

</p><h2><font face="verdana,arial,geneva" size="3"> 1. Personal identification and collection </font></h2>
<p>
Every time you use our website, information is collected by our service. Types of information include:
</p><ul>
<li> The date and time of your visit to our website; 
</li><li> Your IP address; 
</li><li> The address of the documents you access; 
</li><li> The type of browser and operating system you are using; and 
</li><li> Any address of any referring site and any website you are about to visit through our website links. 
</li></ul>

<p>The information that will be collected provides <i>Adviware</i> with details about how the website will be used including the frequency and duration of visits, and which web pages have been accessed on our site.
</p><p><i>Adviware</i> may also conduct surveys or market research and may seek information from you from time to time. These surveys will provide <i>Adviware</i> with information that allows improvement in the types and quality of service offered to you and the manner in which those services are offered. 
</p><p>We will not collect any personal information which may reveal racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, sexual activity or sexual orientation.
</p><p>You may supply to us sensitive information relating to personal health information through emails, chatgroups, chatrooms, forums or feedback forms.  You expressly consent for <i>Adviware</i> to publish on the web site or disclose this information to contracted third parties.  <i>Adviware</i> will anonymise and remove your personal details relating to health information you submit to us prior to any publication (e.g. on our website).

</p><h2><font face="verdana,arial,geneva" size="3"> 1.1 Personal Information via the Adviware website  </font></h2>
<p>Most commercial websites use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that websites send to the browser and are stored in the computer hard-drive. Cookies make using this website easier by storing information about your preferences on this website. This allows the site to be tailored to you on any of your return visits. Cookies will not identify you personally. If you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter your security settings on your web browser to disable cookies or to warn you when cookies are being used. However, by disabling the cookie function in your web browser you may impede your ability to use parts of the site. 

</p><h2><font face="verdana,arial,geneva" size="3"> 2. Use and disclosure of information </font></h2>
<p>The symptom and disease information that you provide to us via emails, chatgroups, chatrooms, forums or feedback forms may be used for two primary purposes. First it will be used for statistical purposes and may be provided to third party researchers. Secondly, it may be used for the <i>Adviware</i> website, published in medical journals, books or magazines. 
</p><p>Specifically, <i>Adviware</i> will not use or disclose or permit the use or disclosure of information that could be used to identify an individual member in any circumstances except:
</p><p>(a) to ensure the proper functioning of the <i>Adviware</i>  website; and
</p><p>(b) where personal information is to be used by a participating third party contracted to <i>Adviware</i> for research and where the participating third party is bound by a confidentiality agreement with <i>Adviware</i>.
</p><p>Your information may also be used or disclosed if:
</p><p>(a) <i>Adviware</i> is required or authorised by law or if it is reasonably necessary to enforce the law; the information is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim; or
</p><p>(b) the necessary authorities (i.e. police, ambulance and fire services) are to believe on reasonable grounds that disclosure is necessary to prevent a threat to life or health;
</p><p>(c) you have given express consent to <i>Adviware</i> for a prescribed purpose.
</p><p><i>Adviware</i> will not sell, distribute, rent, licence, disclose or reveal, share or pass your personally identifiable information onto any third parties, other than those who are contracted to <i>Adviware</i> to keep the information confidential subject to the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and regulations regarding the handling of personal information. 

</p><h2><font face="verdana,arial,geneva" size="3"> 3. Sending information overseas </font></h2>
<p>You consent to <i>Adviware</i> disclosing your symptoms or diseases that you provide via our website, emails, chatgroups, chatrooms, forums or feedback forms to other third parties or researchers contracted to <i>Adviware</i> located outside Australia.  <i>Adviware</i> will take all reasonable steps to ensure that contractually such recipients respect the confidentiality of this information by abiding by equivalent privacy obligations, as those required in Australia.

</p><h2><font face="verdana,arial,geneva" size="3"> 4. Security of your information </font></h2>
<p>We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that all information you provide to us that we use or disclose is stored in a secure environment accessed only by authorised <i>Adviware</i> personnel. 
Please keep in mind that no information transmitted over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We will endeavour to protect your personal information, however we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from our online services. These activities are conducted at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we will use our reasonable efforts to ensure its security. 

</p><h2><font face="verdana,arial,geneva" size="3">5. Credit Card Information </font></h2>
<p><i>Adviware</i> does not currently accept credit card details directly. Instead, our partners such as Amazon.com process credit card transactions without distributing this information to us.  For example, credit card details for orders at our Amazon Zshop are handled by Amazon Payments and are not seen by us.  Email and shipping addresses are provided for us to ship product, but we do not see your billing details. Furthermore, for ordinary Amazom.com book, magazine or other referral sales that bypass our Amazon Zshop, we do not even receive email addresses or personal information, let alone credit card details.  If for any reason we do receive your credit card details, we will use such information only in order to perform credit card verification and transaction approval.  Our partners that collect credit card information may use this information in accordance with their own privacy or other policies and this is beyond our control. 

</p><h2><font face="verdana,arial,geneva" size="3"> 6. Links </font></h2>
<p>This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. This web site contains links to other web sites on the Internet.  Please be aware that we at <i>Adviware</i> are not responsible or liable for the privacy practices of such other web sites. 
</p><p>We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  You access destination links at your own risk.  Because we want to provide you with the best service possible, we would appreciate your comments about any external links at privacy@Adviware.com. 

</p><h2><font face="verdana,arial,geneva" size="3"> 7. Third Party Advertising Services </font></h2>
<p><i>Adviware</i> may utilise certain third-party advertising services (e.g. organizations such as Burst Media, FastClick, Google) to display advertising for our advertisers.  These third-party services may place a cookie on your computer for the purposes of ad tracking and presentation.  <i>Adviware</i> does not share personally identifiable visitor information with its advertising services. 

</p><h2><font face="verdana,arial,geneva" size="3"> 8. Public Forums </font></h2>
<p><i>Adviware</i> may provide its users with chat rooms, forums, polls, discussion areas, message boards and/or news groups.  Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.  Information disclosed in these areas is not subject to this Privacy Statement and will be seen by third parties not related to <i>Adviware</i> and may be used by them for unauthorised purposes, such as to contact you. 

</p><h2><font face="verdana,arial,geneva" size="3"> 9. How to contact us </font></h2>
<p>If you have any concerns or questions, please contact <i>Adviware</i> via our email privacy@adviware.com.  <i>Adviware</i> reserves the right to modify or amend this Statement at any time. 
</p><p>We appreciate you taking the time to read the <i>Adviware</i> Privacy Statement.
