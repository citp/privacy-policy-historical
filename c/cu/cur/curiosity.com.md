# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy discloses the practices of Beacon Solutions, Inc. (d/b/a “Curiosity”) concerning information we obtain by and through your use of the Curiosity.com website (the “Site”) our Curiosity mobile application (the “Application”) and the services offered through either the Site or the Application (the “Services”). 

Curiosity is committed to respecting your privacy and recognizing your need for appropriate protection and management of Personally Identifiable Information you share with us. The purpose of this privacy policy is to explain the types of information Curiosity obtains about visitors to our Site and users of our Application and Services, how the information is obtained, how it is used, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to review and correct, the information. By using the Site, the Services and/or the Application, you are accepting and consenting to the use of your information as described in this policy. 

### A. What Information We Collect 

The information we collect on our Site and through the use of our Services or Application generally falls into the following two categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. If we do combine Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Personally Identifiable Information, the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.

#### (1) Personally Identifiable Information

“Personally Identifiable Information” refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Curiosity collects and stores personally identifiable information that you provide to us. The Personally Identifiable Information we collect may include: your name, date of birth, e-mail address, login name, passwords, etc. We request Personally Identifiable Information when you register on the Site or through the Application.

#### (2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information

“Non-Personally Identifiable Information” refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. This can be can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, gender or interests. The non-personally identifiable data we collect when you visit our Site may include: your Internet Protocol ("IP") address; “cookies” or small text files that collect information about our activity on our Site, including the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the Web site that you came from before visiting our Site, which pages you visit on our Site, which URL you go to next, which browser you used to come to our Site, and any search terms entered on our Site. More information about Cookies appears below.

We may also collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable Information in the form of demographic information, such as your gender, age and interest. We use this information to provide you with personalized services and information that we believe may be of interest to you. We may also collect, analyze and use aggregated and anonymized information about you for market research.

Your use of the Application may also include collection of information from your mobile device. For example, the Application may request your permission to collect location data and/or may request access to multimedia (photos or videos) stored on your mobile device. If you do not wish for your location data to be shared with Curiosity, please respond accordingly when prompted on your mobile device, or visit your mobile device settings. Multimedia will only be collected from your device if you affirmatively select it to upload to the Application (i.e. you choose an image or video to store within the Application).

Our Site and Application may interface with third party sites and services, (for example, social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or other third party applications, sites or services). Our Site may also contain links to websites operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control.

Privacy policies for these third party sites and services may be different from our privacy policy. You access these third party sites and services at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a linked site or integrated service before disclosing any personal information on such site and/or through such service.

Currently, to help facilitate login to our Application and our Site, we offer a sign-on service that allows you to sign in using login credentials from your existing social media account.
