# Privacy Policy | Current

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how Current may collect, use and disclose information we obtain through the Current Service.

The _“Current Service”_ means any websites, mobile applications, and other services under the control of Current, in connection with providing an online or digital platform for Current's services, including the provision of a digital platform on which customers can convert personal funds into digital vouchers redeemable at third party providers of goods and services.

 _“Personal Information”_ means information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you, such as: name, address, email address, or phone number. We do not consider Personal Information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual.

  * register to use the Current Service;

You must register to use the Current Service. When you choose to create an account, you must provide information including your email address and phone number. You may also choose to provide additional, optional information such as your zip code, financial account information, a profile picture, and other information. You may decline to provide additional Personal Information, however, doing so may prevent you from engaging with and using certain parts of the Current Service.

### 1.2. Social Media Connection.

We collect information, including Personal Information, from social media websites, such as Facebook or Twitter, when you connect to your Current account using your social media account.

### 1.5. Mobile Device Information.

We may obtain information from your mobile device such as your device type, machine or mobile device identification number, location data including time zone, language setting, browser type and IP address.

### 1.6. Location data.

If you have ‘background location’ turned on, the Current app will, from time to time, tell us about your device’s location even if you are not directly interacting with the application.

When we have location information, we use it to tailor our Services for you and others, like helping reduce card fraud by matching your card activity with your location.

### 1.7. Cookies, Automatic Data Collection, and Related Technologies.

When you visit the Current Service, we and third parties that provide certain functionality on the Current Service may engage, receive and record information from your use of the Current Service and server logs from your browser, including your IP address, and from cookies and similar technology. This information is used for security purposes, to authenticate your identity, to improve the quality of the Current Service, such as to store your preferences, customize the Current Service, and provide more relevant advertising. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Current Service may not work properly.
