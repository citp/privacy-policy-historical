### The Ingredients of a Cookie

  


When you are browsing websites on the internet, many of these websites store tiny text files called cookies on your computer, to help track your use of the site and to personalise your journey around the website. These cookies can be stored so that if you return to a website, that website server can call the information from the cookies stored on your computer to tailor your experience of the site. 

Currys.co.uk is no different, we use cookies to help you shop our website more effectively and to place online orders - we do not store personally identifiable information in our cookie data. We also use some carefully selected 3rd party suppliers to enhance your online experience and they will place cookies on your computer for use on our website too. 

Cookies are perfectly safe to be stored on your computer and almost all web browsers have cookie storing enabled as default. However, all browsers have the option of disabling cookies being stored on your computer if you wish to do this.

### Banner Advertising & Tags

We use tags from 3rd party suppliers dedicated to helping us improve the relevance of our advertising banners, both on our website and across the web where we have advertisements on other websites. Our advertising policy is designed to give you the most relevant adverts possible, based on your previous visits to our website and the things you looked at, so we can build a profile of what we think you might like to see on our website next time you visit. A tag is simply a way for us to identify if a specific page was viewed by a customer and use that information to form a more accurate advertising strategy.

All reputable companies, such as those we choose to work with, have very strict policies around your privacy and the information captured. They do not collect any information that can personally identify you in any way. Almost all of these tracking tags can be disabled or opted out of. A website dedicated to helping you understand what networks currently use tracking tags on your machine is:

At Currys, we care about security and make every effort to ensure our transaction process is safe and that your personal information is secure. 

We can assure you that every order you make on our website is safe. We use strict security precautions to make our website safe, including the use of a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) server. Any information you enter while you're using the secure server is encrypted before being transmitted, so it is virtually impossible for an outside party to access or intercept your information.

Who we are

In this Privacy Policy references to ‘we’ and ‘us’ are to DSG Retail Limited trading as Currys, Dixons, PC World and KNOWHOW, company number 504877, registered office Maylands Avenue, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire HP2 7TG.

What information we collect and how

The information we collect via this website may include:

(1) Any personal details you type in and submit, such as name, address, email address, etc. We only collect information that we require for completion of orders and account set up. We never store payment details on the websites. 

(2) Data which allows us to recognise you, your preferences and how you use this website. This saves you from re-entering information when you return to the site. This data is collected by cookies from your navigation around the site. A complete guide to our cookies policy and how to control cookies on your computer can be found [here](http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/privacy-on-currys-321-commercial.html#tab-2). 

(3) Your IP address (this is your computer’s individual identification number) which is automatically logged by our web server. This is used to note your interest in our website and your location (e.g. county/city) for our site analytics. 

(4) Your preferences and use of email updates, recorded by emails we send you (if you select to receive email updates on products and offers).

What we do with your information

Any personal information we collect from you will be used in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and other applicable laws. The details we collect will be used: 

(1) to process your order, to process any application for finance or a mobile phone contract etc, to maintain guarantee records and to provide after-sales service (we may pass your details to another organisation to supply/deliver products or services you have purchased and/or to provide after-sales service). 

(2) to carry out security checks (this may involve passing your details to our Identity Verification partner, currently 192.com, who will check details we give them against public and private databases - this helps to protect you and us from fraudulent transactions); and 

(3) to comply with legal requirements (e.g. if you buy a TV or similar, we are obliged to pass your details to the TV licensing authority).   
We are a subsidiary of Dixons Retail plc and we may need to pass the information we collect to other companies within our group for administrative purposes. We may use third parties to carry out certain activities, such as processing and sorting data, monitoring how customers use our site and issuing our emails for us. 

We would also like to inform you of various promotions, goods and services that may be of interest to you. These would come from any of our chains, including Currys, Dixons, PC World and KNOWHOW, from our affiliates, or from carefully selected third parties. You may be contacted by post, email, telephone, SMS or such other means as we regard as appropriate, including new technology. If you wish to receive these communications, please tick the ‘Yes’ box when entering your personal details. You may unsubscribe at a later date, if you wish - ‘Your rights’ section below.
