### Banner Advertising & Tags

In addition to the list of cookies that we use on Currys, we wanted to take you through our use of advertising tags. We use tags from 3rd party suppliers dedicated to helping us improve the relevance of our advertising banners, both on our website and across the web where we have advertisements on other websites. Our advertising policy is designed to give you the most relevant adverts possible, based on your previous visits to our website and the things you looked at and/or added to your basket, so we can build a profile of what we think you might like to see on our website next time you visit. A tag is simply a way for us to identify if a specific page was viewed by a customer and use that information to form a more accurate advertising strategy. 

Many online businesses work with such partners as ours below in order to improve and personalise the experience their customers have of their website and brand advertising online. All reputable companies, such as those we choose to work with, have very strict policies around your privacy and the information captured. They do not collect any information that can personally identify you in any way. Almost all of these tracking tags can be disabled or opted out of. A website dedicated to helping you understand what networks currently use tracking tags on your machine is: 

<http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices>

If for any reason this option has been disabled on your browser, you will not be able to transact or login until you reset these options. Find this option in your browser settings under security.
