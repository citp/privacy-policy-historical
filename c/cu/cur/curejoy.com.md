Certain information about your visit can be collected when you browse websites. When you browse the Website, we, and in some cases our third-party service providers, can collect the following types of information about your visit, including:

  * Domain from which you accessed the Internet
  * IP address (an IP or internet protocol address is a number that is automatically assigned to a device connected to the web)
  * Approximate geographic location based on the IP address of the user’s local system
  * Operating system (which is software that directs a computer’s basic functions such as executing programs and managing storage) for the device that you are using and information about the browser you used when visiting the site
  * Date and time of your visit
  * Pages you visited
  * Address of the website that connected you to the Website (such as google.com or facebook.com)
  * Device type (desktop computer, tablet, or type of mobile device)
  * Screen resolution
  * Browser language
  * Time spent on page
  * Scroll depth – The measure of how much of a web page was viewed
  * User interaction events (e.g. clicking a button or clicking on an ad)



**How do we use this information**

  * To help make our site more useful to you. For example, based on the history of articles read by you on the website, we determine a more relevant set of articles to recommend to you for further reading, in our recommended articles section, or as part of our infinite scroll functionality, or through browser notifications.
  * To collect aggregated data on site usage. For example, based on the distribution of visitors across different geographies, we tune our marketing outreach in those geographies.
  * To help place more relevant and personalized ads. For example, we use your ad interaction data to cap the frequency of an ad being shown to you, and to show ads that are relevant to your location, or relevant to the content you are browsing, or similar to products that you may have shown interest in, (by clicking) in the past.

**Cookies and Tracking Technologies**

CureJoy uses cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our websites. Additionally, some Internet browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are currently not set up to respond to such signals. We use session Cookies that expire at the end of a browser session (from when a user opens the browser window to when they exit the browser) and persistent Cookies which remain on your hard drive until you erase them or they expire. How long a persistent Cookie remains on your browser depends on how long the visited website has programmed the Cookie to last or they can be stored for longer. We use Cookies for different purposes, including tracking your consent for various services, personalizing content, and targeting advertisements.
