The terms "You" and "Your" refer to you, as a user of the Site. The terms "Personal Information" and "Your Information" mean information that personally identifies you or allows you to be contacted or identified, such as your username, email address, and any other data that is tied to such information.

What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy covers treatment of Personal Information that you provide to us and that we gather when you are on the Site. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners may share with us.

This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that the Company does not own or control, or to individuals that the Company does not employ or manage.

What Information About Customers Does Currenthiphop Collect?

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a friendly, customized and efficient experience while on the Site. We collect the following types of information from our users:

Information You Provide to Us

We receive and store any information you enter on the Site or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our Site's features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to requests for certain services, customizing the content and advertising, and communicating with you about specials, new products, services and features. In order for you to use our Site, you are not required to register; however, you must register to take advantage of certain features of the Site, such as bookmarking favorites and other information to appear on your dashboard, and receiving e-mail newsletters from us. To register, you must provide your e-mail address, a username and a password. 

Information Collected Automatically

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Site. The Company automatically receives and records traffic data on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information and the webpage you requested. The Company uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Site.

Generally, we automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular television show. This data is only used in the aggregate and not in a way that would identify you personally, and enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Site. In addition, we may provide statistical information, not information about you personally, to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how people use the Site, so that they may provide you with an optimal online experience.

E-mail Communications

We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Currenthiphop if your computer supports this type of program. We do this in order to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful and to improve our service. We also send out e-mails with news or promotions. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please contact us at [email@currenthiphop.com].

Cookies

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that the Site transfers to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when webpages in our Site are visited and by how many people. Currenthiphop cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us what your username or e-mail address is or who you are.

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will either prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie or fully disable cookies. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Currenthiphop's most attractive features.

The following advertising agencies, advertising networks and other companies (collectively, "Advertisers") place advertisements on the Site and may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technology to collect information about users.
