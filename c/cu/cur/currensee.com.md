# Security Policy | www.currensee.com

### Introduction

Currensee, Inc (“Currensee”, “we” or “us”) desires to protect the privacy of our visitors and members in Currensee’s social trader network at [www.currensee.com](http://www.currensee.com/ "www.currensee.com") (the “Site”). 

### 1\. Safeguarding private information

This privacy and security policy (“Privacy Policy”) is intended to provide you notice of our information management practices, including the types of information gathered and how it is used and safeguarded. Your use of this Site constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, which are hereby incorporated by reference. <http://www.currensee.com/terms-of-use>

Our employees and third-party service providers do not have access to private data, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use, or as otherwise disclosed to you.

### 2\. Collection and Our Use of Information

We will collect no personally identifiable information about you when you visit our Site unless you voluntarily choose to provide that information to us. Any personally identifiable information that you provide to us via our Site will be used only for such purposes as are described either in this Privacy Policy (including the terms of use) or at the point of collection, such as to respond to your questions or comments, to register, to send you a requested brochure or to otherwise send information to you.

### 3\. Aggregate and Statistical Data

We may collect certain aggregate data called web log information (such as your web browser, operating system, pages visited, etc.) and use cookies when you visit the Site (collectively, the “Aggregate and Statistical Data”). For instance, when you visit the Site, our web server will automatically recognize some non-personal information, including but not limited to the date and time you visited the Site, the pages you visited, the referrer (the website you came from), the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, and the domain name and address of your Internet service provider. Neither the web log information nor cookies (as discussed below) collects any personal information. They do not contain personal information, such as your name or e-mail address, and in no way are used to identify our users. Aggregate and Statistical Data helps us design the Site, to identify popular features, and for other managerial purposes.

### 4\. Personally Identifiable Information

You may also be asked to provide personally identifiable information on the Site, which may include your name, address, telephone number, forex trading account number, credit card number and e-mail address (your “Personally Identifiable Information”). This information may be gathered when feedback or e-mails are sent to the Site, when you register for an account, use our service, post information on the Site or use a credit card to pay for any payments. In all cases, you have the option of providing us with the Personally Identifiable Information, though certain services and features may not be available to you if you do not provide personally identifiable information. You agree that we may contact you to provide you with information we believe may be of interest to you. At that time, you will be offered the opportunity to opt out of this service. You may remove your e-mail address from the list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of every e-mail. We will not rent or sell your Personally Identifiable Information or share it with anyone except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy.

**Transaction and holdings amounts**

Personally Identifiable Information may also include information associated with your executed transactions. We may use the raw data associated with this information for calculations and normalization purposes. This information is not shared with other members, except as provided in this Privacy Policy (including the Terms of Use).

**Controlling access to your Personally Identifiable Information**

We offer varying levels of information sharing. It is your decision what information is shared, and how.

**Publicly available** – Information at this level can be accessed by anyone visiting the Site.

**Registered community** – Information tagged at this level can be accessed by members of the Currensee community.

**My Trading Team** – Information tagged at this level can only be accessed by members of your trading team, which you have explicitly authorized to have access to such information.

**Private information** – Information tagged at this level can only be seen by you.

You may set the access level separately for each of the following areas of your personal profile:

**General information. **This may include general information, such as your status, your bio or your picture.****

**Trading Profile.** This may include information about your trading approach, trading hours, number of trades and other similar information.

**Trading team.** This generally includes a listing of your team members.

### 5\. Non-Personally Identifiable Information 

Data that is not personally identifiable, such as answers to surveys, comments, ideas and suggestions that do not include your personally identifying information, are deemed to be non-confidential, and we are free to disclose and use such data, without any obligation whatsoever to you for any purpose and through any means.

### 6\. Use of Cookies

We may store cookies on your computer or other technology to improve the quality of your visit to our Site, and to remember certain user attributes. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use “cookie" technology for several purposes. First, we use it to track general information about our users. The information collected through cookies is non-personally identifiable information and we use this information for statistical and market research purposes. We also give you the option to use cookies to establish a link between your computer and Currensee , to help authenticate you and to customize the Site’s content so that the information made available is more likely to be of interest to you. This link assures that, when you return to our Site, you will be able to log in without the necessity of providing your password, or help us to avoid asking for the same information on your return visits to the Site. You have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. Refer to your browser’s instructions or “Help” button to learn more about cookies.

### 7\. Security Technology

Currensee uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in order to provide a secure environment for all transactions and to protect certain information that you submit from loss, misuse and alteration while under our control. This type of technology also protects you from having your information intercepted by anyone other than Currensee while it is being transmitted to us. We work hard to ensure that our Web sites are secure and that they meet industry standards. We also use other safeguards such as firewalls, authentication systems (e.g., passwords and personal identification numbers), and access control mechanisms to control unauthorized access to systems and data.

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

When you access our member areas, you are required to login by providing your username and your password. To preserve privacy and confidentiality, your login information is transmitted in an encrypted format through a multi-factor authentication process. If you circumvent such authentication and/or log-in process in any manner, you agree that you are liable for any and all subsequent security breaches involving your account(s).

### 8\. Sharing Information with Third Parties

Currensee does not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties, except as described in this Privacy Policy (including the Terms of Use). Third party disclosures may include sharing such information with non-affiliated companies that perform support services for you as a member, including those that provide professional, legal, or accounting advice to Currensee. Personally Identifiable Information may be disclosed to non-affiliated companies that assist Currensee in providing services to you and are required to maintain the confidentiality of such information. We may also disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to other third parties as may be authorized by you.

Currensee may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties, only as necessary, that we engage to provide certain financial and other services to you. This information may be disclosed as part of normal business operations and as part of normal legal and or regulatory purposes required by our service partners, the Internal Revenue Service, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other regulatory and government entities, and to third parties to assist in the analysis of Aggregate and Statistical Data, business analysis and marketing strategies. These third parties are bound by confidentiality provisions to assure the protection of your Personally Identifiable Information.

Your Personally Identifiable Information is never sold to third parties.

### 9\. Regulatory Disclosure

Under limited circumstances, Currensee may disclose your personal information to third parties as permitted by, or to comply with, applicable laws and regulations. For example, we may disclose personal information to cooperate with regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies to comply with subpoenas or other official requests, and as necessary to protect our rights or property. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not use your Personally Identifiable Information for any other purpose, unless we describe how such information will be used at the time you disclose it to us or we obtain your permission.
