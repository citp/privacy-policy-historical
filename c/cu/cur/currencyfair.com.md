### 5\. How we use automated processing or “analytics” & our legal basis

We use automated statistical analysis of the information we collect about you as part of our business:

  * Analysis of your information helps us to make automated decisions.
  * When you apply for a financial product or service, we may evaluate the application using statistical analysis to determine whether or not the product best meets your needs.
  * We may decide whether or not to give you a financial product or service.
  * We may calculate the specific charges that we need to charge on a specific product or transaction to reflect the risk involved.
  * To manage existing credit agreements you have with us, such as your Current Account overdraft. For example, when you or any authorised user seeks to perform a transaction, information may be sent to us to evaluate and determine whether to approve, decline or refer a transaction for further review. Where we make solely automated decisions that affect you in a legal or a significant way, you have the right to provide your point of view and have those decisions reviewed by a member of our team.
  * Automated analysis of our customer information (including your information) as a whole helps us to manage our business for our legitimate interests.



It enables us to:

  * Make more informed business decisions, including improving the quality of products and services we can offer (including for the purposes of direct marketing, unless you have objected to us using your details in this way).
  * Test and maintain the stability and performance of our systems.
  * Carry out long-term statistical modelling, provided that such modelling does not affect any decision we make about you.
  * Automated analysis of your information also enables us for service, administrative purposes and helps us to form a single view of your relationship with CurrencyFair.
  * This is intended to help us to manage and build our relationship with you and is an important part of managing our business in our legitimate interests.
  * For example, it enables us to develop personalised information for you in real-time based on your financial and personal circumstances (for example, providing you with information when you log into your account on how to minimise exchange fees, bank charges, or to warn you that your account is running low so you can put it in funds in order to meet a future need).
  * Automated analysis of your information assists us to comply with our legal obligations.
  * For example, in connection with our money laundering, fraud and terrorist financing prevention obligations, we may use automated processing to screen for suspicious transactions, or to identify payments which may be subject to international sanctions.
  * There are certain automated analyses of your information that we will only carry out where you have given us your consent (which you can withdraw at any time).
  * We will only automatically process your information to enable us to undertake the following activities where we have your consent and each time we interact with you we will always provide you the opportunity to cease to receive further such messages.
  * Send electronic messages to you about new product and service offers enhancements from CurrencyFair and/or our selected trusted partners.
  * Share your data with third parties so that they may send you electronic messaging about their products and offers.
  * Use your transaction history/account information from your CurrencyFair account and Multicurrency card Bank of Ireland current to identify your transactional patterns and habits, in order to personalise offers that are exclusive and individual to you, based on your account transactions. We will provide you with more information on this when we seek your consent.
  * Use your location data to send you information regarding special offers from us or our partners close to your location.
  * Use sensitive categories of data, as set out in data protection legislation.
  * Use information you have made public and combine this with the activities outlined above.

### 7\. How long we hold your information

Those factors include:

  * The regulatory rules contained in laws and regulations or set by authorities like the Central Bank of Ireland, for example, in the Consumer Protection Code.
  * Whether you and us are in a legal or some other type of dispute with another person or each other.
  * The type of data we hold about you.
  * Whether you or a regulatory authority asks us to keep it for a valid reason.
  * Whether we use your data for long-term statistical modelling, provided that such modelling does not affect any decision we make about you.
  * As a general rule, we keep your information for a specified period after the date on which a transaction has completed or you cease to be a customer. In most cases this period is seven (7) years, but may be twelve (12) years where we had a deed in place.

  * Provide our products and services to you and fulfil our contract with you.

  * Comply with our legal obligations.
  * Of course, you can choose not to share information, but doing so may limit the services we are able to provide to you.

  * We may not be able to assess your suitability for a product or service, or, where relevant, give you a recommendation to provide you with a CurrencyFair financial product or service.
  * When we request information, we will tell you if providing it is a contractual requirement or not, and whether or not we need it to comply with our legal obligations.



### 9\. The legal basis for using your information

We will use your data and share that data where:

  * Its use is necessary in relation to a service or a contract that you have entered into or because you have asked for something to be done so you can enter into a contract with us.
  * Its use is in accordance with our legitimate interests outlined in this notice.
  * Its use is necessary because of a legal obligation that applies to us (except an obligation imposed by a contract). An example of this would be us sharing your information with the Central Credit Register.
  * You have consented or explicitly consented to the using of your data (including special categories of data) in a specific way.
  * Its use is necessary to protect your “vital interests”.
  * In exceptional circumstances we may use and/or disclose information (including special categories of data) we hold about you to identify, locate or protect you, for example, if it comes to our attention that you are in imminent physical danger and this information is requested by An Garda Síochána/Police Force or your relative.
  * Where you have made clearly sensitive categories of data about yourself public.
  * Where the processing of special categories of data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
  * Where authorised by law or regulation, we may undertake processing of special categories of data for a substantial public interest.
  * Where the processing of criminal conviction data is authorised by EU or local law.



### 10\. Processing your information outside the EEA

Your information is stored on secure systems within CurrencyFair premises and with providers of secure information storage.

We may transfer or allow the transfer of information about you and your products and services with us to our service providers and other organisations outside the European Economic Area (EEA), but only if they agree to act solely on our instructions and protect your information to the same standard that applies in the EEA. For example, we may process payments using third parties (including other financial institutions such as banks and the worldwide payments system operated by the SWIFT organisation) if, for example, you make a CHAPS payment or a foreign payment. Those external organisations may process and store your personal information abroad and may disclose it to foreign authorities to help them in their fight against crime and terrorism.

#### Using companies to process your information outside the EEA.

Some of our service providers, for example IT, telecommunication, credit reference agencies, payment processors, custodians and providers of administration services, tracing agents and contractors are based outside of the EEA. Where we authorise the processing/ transfer of your personal information outside of the EEA, we require your personal information to be protected to at least Irish standards and include the following data protection transfer mechanisms:

  * Copies of the CurrencyFair’s current Model Clauses are available on request. These are standard clauses in our contracts with our service providers to ensure that any personal data leaving the EEA will be transferred in compliance with EU data-protection law.
  * Adherence to the EU/US Privacy Shield. You can find more information on the EU/US Privacy Shield at www.privacyshield.gov including a list of all organisations that have signed up to the EU/US Privacy Shield framework. Please contact us for further details on any transfers of personal information by CurrencyFair to entities in the US.
  * Currently in order to provide enhanced customer service customer data is shared between our Irish and Australian offices. This is done in accordance with Irish EU and Australian Data Protection requirements.



### 11\. How to exercise your information rights (including the right to object)

Providing and holding personal information comes with significant rights on your part and significant obligations on ours. You have several rights in relation to how we use your information. If you make your request electronically, we will, where possible, provide the relevant information electronically unless you ask us otherwise.

You have the right to:

  * Find out if we use your information, to access your information and to receive copies of the information we have about you.
  * Request that inaccurate information is corrected and incomplete information updated.
  * Object to particular uses of your personal data where the legal basis for our use of your data is our legitimate business interests (for example, profiling we carry out for our legitimate business interests) or the performance of a task in the public interest. However, doing so may have an impact on the services and products we can / are willing to provide.
  * Object to use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. If you object to this use, we will stop using your data for direct marketing purposes 
  * Have your data deleted or its use restricted – you have a right to this under certain circumstances.For example, where you withdraw consent you gave us previously and there is no other legal basis for us to retain it, or where you object to our use of your personal information for particular legitimate business interests.
  * Obtain a transferable copy of certain data to which can be transferred to another provider, known as “the right to data portability”.
  * This right applies where personal information is being processed based on consent or for performance of a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means. You are not able to obtain through the data portability right all of the personal information that you can obtain through the right of access. The right also permits the transfer of data directly to another provider where technically feasible. Therefore, depending on the technology involved, we may not be able to receive personal data transferred to us and we will not be responsible for the accuracy of same.
  * Withdraw consent at any time, where any processing is based on consent. If you withdraw your consent, it will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal.



We are obliged to respond without undue delay. In most instances, we will respond within one calendar month. If we are unable to deal with your request fully within a calendar month (due to the complexity or number of requests), we may extend this period by a further two calendar months. Should this be necessary, we will explain the reasons why. If you make your request electronically, we will, where possible, provide the relevant information electronically unless you ask us otherwise. You have the right to complain to the Data Protection Commission or another supervisory authority.
