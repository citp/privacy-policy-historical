Any information that you may disclose on our Services such as in blogs, on message boards, in chat rooms, or on other public areas on the Services, becomes public information. Please exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these public areas. If you terminate your account, we may continue to show some of your content in anonymized form.

**Information We Receive From Third Parties**

We may receive information about you from our third party’s franchisees in order to provide online membership services, under a requirement that your information is then subject to the terms of this policy while in our possession or control.

In the event of a complaint, we may also receive Personal Information about you from other parties or from other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation to that complaint.

**Information Automatically Collected**

We may collect some information automatically, including: cookies, web beacons, log files or other technologies. We use this information to learn about our Service users, to allow you to save your password, to deliver online advertisements that we think would be more relevant to your interests, to monitor interactions with our emails and online advertisements, and to link data collected across other computers or devices that you may use. 

Some of this information may include: your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, software version, and the domain name from which you accessed the Services.  In addition, we may collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you visit the Services, the areas or pages of the Services that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing or using the Services, the number of times you return to the Site, other click-stream or Service usage data, and emails or ads that you open, forward or click through to our Services.

You may have the option of choosing whether or not to share some of this Personal Information with us. For example, your browser may allow you to turn off cookie sharing.  If you choose to turn off cookies, however, some portions of our Services will not work properly for you, or you will not be able to register or access certain sections of the Services. 

Please note that our Services use Google Analytics, a service that transmits website traffic data to Google servers in the United States.  Google Analytics does not identify the individual users or visitors, nor does it associate users’ or visitors’ IP addresses with any other data held by Google.  We use Google Analytics reports to help us understand website traffic and webpage usage. If you wish to prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics, Google has developed the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on available [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on these Services. They may collect anonymous information about your use of our Services, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this Site and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads. At this time due to technical limitations we do not respond to browser do not track signals.

**Social Media and Sharing**

Our Site includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets, such as the “Share This” button or interactive mini-programs, that run on our Site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is one hundred percent secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

The Services may have links to third-party websites or applications, which may have privacy policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the practices of such sites or applications. Please note that if you provide any information on your own to third parties, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of your personal information. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third parties.
