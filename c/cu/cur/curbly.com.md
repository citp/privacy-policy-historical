### How we use information 

Our primary goal in collecting your customer information is to provide you with a personalized, relevant, and positive experience with the Curbly Website. Curbly will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to others except as set forth in this policy. 

You can register on the Curbly Website to receive promotions and updates, or to be contacted for market research purposes. The contact information you submit will not be used for these purposes unless you specifically "opt-in". You can control your privacy preferences regarding such marketing communications (see the section below entitled "Your Privacy Preferences"). 

From time to time, you may be invited to participate in optional customer surveys or contests, and Curbly may request that you provide some or all of the above listed personal information in those surveys or contests. We use information collected through contests to contact winners and award prizes. We use information collected from surveys to learn about our customers in order to improve our services and develop new products and services of interest to our customers. 

Curbly uses IP addresses, cookies, clear gifs, browser detection, and weblogs to provide a better experience on our website and to give us useful business information. 

IP addresses define the Internet location of computers and help us better understand the geographic distribution of our members and manage the performance of the Curbly Website. Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer when you visit the Curbly Website, so we can immediately recognize you when you return to the site and deliver content specific to your interests. You may modify your browser preferences to accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or reject all cookies. Please consult your browser instructions for information on how to modify your choices about cookies. 

We also use a technology called clear gifs. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers that are used to track emails and online movements, helping us understand what marketing campaigns and content are effective. 

We detect the type of web browser you are using to optimize the performance of our website and to understand the mix of browsers used by our visitors, guests, and members. To learn about how people use our site, we examine weblogs, which show the paths people take through our site and how long they spend in certain areas. 

Curbly also sometimes contract with unaffiliated third parties to provide services, such as software for site features, customer communications, sweepstakes and prize fulfillment, analyzing and evaluating the information we collect, and other services. When we do this, we may provide your personally identifiable information to third parties only to provide those services, and they are not authorized to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. 

###  Our Commitment to Data Security
