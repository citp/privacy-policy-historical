# Curology - Privacy Policy

Last Updated: April 25, 2019

Curology understands that your personal information, including your health information, is important to you. Therefore, we have developed this privacy and security policy (this “Privacy Policy”) to describe how your personal information may be collected, used and disclosed by Curology, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including the medical practices and other healthcare entities with which Curology contracts in order to provide products and services to you, (collectively, “Curology,” “we”, “us”, or “our”). This Privacy Policy applies to websites and/or mobile applications (collectively, the “Website” or “Websites”), and/or other digital services (including our social media pages) or email messages (collectively, the “Products”), that are offered or operated by Curology and in which this Privacy Policy is posted or linked.

By using our Websites, purchasing and/or using our Products, and/or providing your personal information to Curology, you acknowledge this Privacy Policy, whether or not you register for an account with Curology through the Website (an “Account,” and collectively with the Websites and the Products, the “Services”).

PLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. **IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PROVISION IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE, PURCHASE OR USE THE PRODUCTS, PROVIDE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO CUROLOGY, OR REGISTER FOR AN ACCOUNT.**

This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites or applications that do not link or display this Privacy Policy or that display or link to different privacy policies. In addition to this Privacy Policy, Curology has established Terms of Service that set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of the Website. Please review the Terms of Service carefully since they contain provisions that limit Curology’s liability to your use of the Website and Products.

A copy of the Terms of Service can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/terms/).

## The Personal Information We Collect Through the Services

Personal Information we collect may include, but is not limited to, contact information, including, name, email address, mailing address, phone number, age, and gender.

Personal Information also includes certain “Sensitive Personal Information” as may be defined under federal or state law, or as otherwise set forth in Curology policies. Sensitive Personal Information may be subject to stricter regulation and consent requirements than other information. Before providing Sensitive Personal Information to us in any manner, including through our Services, you should carefully consider whether to disclose such Sensitive Personal Information.

If you submit any Personal Information to us relating to other people to us in connection with the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and that you permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
