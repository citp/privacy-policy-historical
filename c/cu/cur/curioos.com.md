These advertising service providers may collect non-identifiable information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services. Such non-identifiable information does not include your name, address, email address or other personal information. The information is collected through the use of cookies and pixel tags (also known as action tags), which is industry-standard technology used by most major websites. 

Our third party advertising partners may use information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for products and services available from Curioos.

### Social Media Interactions

Curioos invites you to socialize and share your fashion inspiration, finds and purchases with your friends using Social Media tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest and Instagram. If you choose to use these tools, you may be sharing certain profile elements, including your comments. This sharing is subject to each social media program's privacy policies. We also use Facebook Social Plugins to allow Facebook to share information and friends' activities with its members while they are on our website. For example, Social Plugins allow Facebook to show you and your friends' "Likes" on our product pages if you are logged into Facebook while shopping at Curioos. com. Curioos does not receive or control any of the content from Facebook Social Plugins. To remove a previously-given Facebook "Like" through Curioos, place your cursor in the "grayed out" Like button and click on the "X" that appears. This removes the "Like" from your Facebook Page, as well as from Curioos’ websites. You can also delete comments made while at Curioos.com from your Facebook Page.
