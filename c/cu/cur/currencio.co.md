We may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are the subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another third party. 
  4. Your Data equals your Rights! – Your personal data is your right, and our obligation is to be transparent about the way we may use it for the purposes of providing our services to us. We have compiled a list of your rights that you may exercise at any time. For more information, please send us a question on our Customer Support e-mail, or inform yourself about your rights in-depth by reading the new privacy regulations. You may exercise the rights included below by sending a notice to us at any time:

    1. Right to Access – You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information (which includes details of the purpose of processing, categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data). Where there is no legal constraint, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, with the additional copies being subject to a reasonable fee. 
    2. Right to Rectification – You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.

Those circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure.

    4. Right of Processing Restriction – In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest. 
    5. Right to Object Processing – You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose. You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
