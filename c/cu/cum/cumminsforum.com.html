<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.&nbsp; For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.&nbsp; Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality..&nbsp; </p>

<p>Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications.&nbsp; These Web beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer.&nbsp; This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and emails bring you to our website and how you use the site.&nbsp; Cummins Forum.com prohibits Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.</p>
