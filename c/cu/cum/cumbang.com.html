We will often collect Data at several points throughout the Site, its links and through related functionality.
</p><p>

</p><p>

For example, such information may be requested, on an optional basis, for participation in special promotions or other Offers (See Paragraph 7 below). -->
</p><p>
The only personally-identifying information we collect and store about you is the information you, voluntarily choose to provide to us, such as your name, e-mail address, address, zip code, telephone number, etc., in response to a specific prompt that requires you to initially enter the information.  In addition, we, our agents, affiliates, Third Party Program Participants and others may ask you to voluntarily provide additional personal information for billing, shipping and other similar purposes.
</p><p>
When a visitor, member, subscriber, or other Site user, requests web pages from the SiteÕs server, clicks on banners or other links or otherwise uses the SiteÕs services or other functionalities, we or our agents may automatically collect some information or data about the user and the userÕs Site use, including the IP address from which the Site is being accessed, the pages or links that were requested, the special preferences or requests of the user and cookie information received from the computer of the user.  You agree that all such information and other Data may be collected and used by the Site and its agents.

</p><p>

3. Cookies<br>
We use cookies for your convenience.  For example, we use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate and otherwise use our Site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive.  Cookies can be used to "remember" what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move between and interact with Web pages and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet.  The Site also uses cookies to store and sometimes track information to make your online experience easier and more personalized and for other purposes related to your use of the Site and related services.  For example, because  a cookie can be linked to information you have inputted or which has otherwise been collected, the  need to repetitively enter certain information, such as your username or email address, can be eliminated. The use of cookies also assists us in acquiring important Site usage Data.  Cookies can also assist us in tracking and targeting the interests, preferences and desires of our Site users to present the most appropriate messages, offers and other communications to our users, and to generally enhance their experience at our Site.
</p><p>
Currently, there are two general types of cookies commonly used in association with typical Web sites including our Site:  "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies.  A session or "session ID" cookie is functional only during the current "session" use of your browser, i.e., it ceases to function when you close you browser.  A "persistent" cookie remains on your hard beyond the current browser session. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "Help" file. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.
</p><p>
Also, some Site use rewards and other benefits tied to Site usage use session cookies to track your Site usage and give you proper credit.  We  also use  persistent cookies to track the actions of our users to enhance the experience on our site, other web sites and to more effectively communicate Offers,  promotional data and other useful information to you.  At the present time, we intend to  also adopt and use helpful future cookie technology, and similar types of technologies, as they become available. We may implement any and all such new technologies and similar improvements to Site functionality without notice.
</p><p>
We may also track special offers, promotions and other advertising delivered by us, and your responses to them, by using cookies.  This helps us reduce the number of offers that might not be interesting to you. We also use cookies to help us credit persons who referred or introduced you to us.
</p><p>
The Site may also automatically collect traffic and click-through data as well as information regarding the online behavior of subscribers and other Site users by the use of cookies or other programming means.  Any and all information about Site users collected by the Company, or its agents or affiliates via the Site or otherwise, through the use of cookies or other programming means may be freely included in our databases and used in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
</p><p>
Some of our Third Party Program Participants, advertisers, agents and others use cookies on or in association with our Site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.  We may also allow third-party service providers to deliver special offers or services to Site users and to control the use of their cookies on your computer. Since such providers may set , access and otherwise control  their cookies on your computer, we urge you to  consult their privacy policies as they pertain to use of their cookies and the data collected from such use.
</p><p>
Most major Web browsers are set up so that they will initially accept cookies, but you may modify your computers preferences to issue you an alert when a cookie is downloaded, or to disable the ability of third parties to download a cookie to you.  If you choose to reject  cookies, or disable your computerÕs ability to receive or process them, there are areas of this Site, other related web sites and related services that may not function properly.  For example, you may not be able to view or interact with parts of the Site or access some of the services or offers otherwise available on the Site.  Also, if you disable or reject cookies, you may not be credited for actions required for certain gifts and other benefits, and therefore may not receive such benefits.

</p><p>

4. Clear GIFs ("Web Beacons")<br>
Clear GIFs, otherwise known as "web beacons"or "single-pixel GIFs", are very small web page graphics that contain a unique digital identifying  means.  They function like cookies, in that they are often used to track and measure online actions taken by web site users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded into the graphics, text or other components of Web pages, including pop up windows, or in other digital documents that can support them, like email messages.  We may also use Web Beacons to optimize search engine functionality. Clear GIFs are nearly invisible and are often only the size of small dot, such as a period at the end of a sentence.  Also, like cookies, Clear GIFs, help us and our Third Party Program Participants measure and improve Site efficiency and effectiveness.  For example, we may use web beacon technology to access your personally identifiable information or compile aggregated statistics about overall Site usage.
</p><p>
Many of our Third Party Program Participants and advertisers also employ Clear GIFs on our Site and in related sites.
</p><p>


5. Log Files<br>
The Company and Third Party Program Participants, through the functionality of the Site, related sites and related services, gather Data and other information regarding Site navigation and Site use from cookies, clear GIFs and other means and store such information in log files and other databases.  This Data and similar information includes date and time recordation data, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, Internet service provider (ISP) data, referring or exit pages, your computerÕs operating system and components, such as your browser type, and other data. While this information generally does not directly identify individual users, it does provide us with Data and other broad demographic information. We use this information for a number of purposes including Site usage analysis, analysis of Site  navigation by users, determining and analyzing overall user preferences and user trends,  Site administration, and general improvement and optimization of Site efficiency and effectiveness and user communications, including promotions to users.  We  may also provide third parties with some or all such information and other Data collected
