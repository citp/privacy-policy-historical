I do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to third parties without your explicit permission. Any personal data collected by me will be used only by me. Any future request for permission to release customer (your) information to 3rd parties will be done clearly, directly and personaly ONLY and not via hidden or "small print" forms. Please note, that I am required to provide information to international, federal or california law enforcement agencies if they make an legal and official request which I can not deny by law.

**Collection of Non-PII (Non Personally Identifiable Information)**  
I currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize my Internet Operations and communications. I use the services of marketing companies to help me measure the effectiveness of advertisments and promotions and how visitors use the site. To do this, I use Action Tags and cookies provided by the marketing companies on this site. The information I collect help me learn things like what kinds of visitors the site attracts, which of my provided resources most interest my Visitors, and what kinds of content my visitors like to see.

One Service I use is SiteMeter. SiteMeter allows me to share publically the information that are tracked and some statistics that are probably not just interesting for me. [Check them out](http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&s=s29cumbrowski).

Additional Tracking Services used are Google Analytics, MyWebLog, HitTail, CrazyEgg and some in-house developed tracking. I also plugin other Services from time to time for testing and research purposes. Looking for a Tracking and Web Analytics solution for yourself? [Clicktracks](http://www.cumbrowski.com/CarstenC/Web-Analytics-Software.asp) is a good and professional solution. Also check my [Web Analytics Resources](http://www.cumbrowski.com/CarstenC/internetmarketing_webanalytics.asp). 

Although the marketing companies logs the information coming from me site on my behalf, I control to a certain extend how that data may and may not be used.
