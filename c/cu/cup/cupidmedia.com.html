If however, we determine that the collection of your Personal Information is not permitted under the terms of the Australian Privacy Principles or other applicable law, then we will destroy or de-identify that Information as soon as practicable, where it is lawful and reasonable to do so.</p>
              <p><strong>4.7  Information Not Confidential</strong></p>
              <p>You agree that any material or information provided by you, save and except for any Personal Information (which may include your full name, postal address, telephone number etc.) the use of which is governed by this Privacy Policy, will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and we may use such material or information without restriction. Specifically, you consent to Cupid Media using such material or information (including any profile information, photographs, video or audio recordings) that you have provided to us) in order to copy your profile into any other relevant dating site owned and operated by Cupid Media. You acknowledge that any such material or information provided by you will be available for other members or users of the Website to read.</p>
              <p><strong>4.8  Communication</strong></p>
              <p>The Company reserves the right to send electronic mail to you regarding recommended matches, notification alerts of activity such as interest alerts or email alerts, for promotions or offers, changes or additions to the Service, or any products and services of the Company and its affiliated businesses. Members may manage their email preferences by using the "Settings / Notifications" function to customize what type of email communications they wish to receive.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Access and Correction</strong></p>
              <p><strong>5.1  Access to Personal Information</strong></p>
              <p>We will provide you with access to the Personal Information held by us in relation to you except to the extent that:<br>
                (a) giving access would be unlawful; or<br>
                (b) denying access is required or authorised by or under an Australian law, other applicable law or a court/tribunal order. </p>
              <p><strong>5.2 Request for Access</strong></p>
              <p>To request access to the Personal Information held by us about you, you must contact us using the contact details provided in clause 1, following which we will contact you within a reasonable time from our receipt of your request and either provide you with that Personal Information, or notify you when we will provide you with the Personal Information. In any event the Personal Information requested will be provided not more than 30 days after our receipt of your request unless we decide not to provide you with access to the Personal Information in which case we will advise you of the reasons for such decision.</p>
              <p><strong>5.3 Commercially Sensitive Information</strong></p>
              <p>Where providing access to the Personal Information would reveal evaluative information generated by us in connection with a commercially sensitive decision making process we will give you an explanation for the commercially sensitive decision rather than direct access to the Personal Information.</p>
              <p><strong>5.4 Use of Intermediaries</strong></p>
              <p>Where because of any of the reasons described in 5.1 above we are not required to provide you with access to the Information then we will, if it is reasonable to do so, give consideration to whether the use of mutually agreed intermediaries would allow sufficient access to meet our respective needs.</p>
              <p><strong>5.5 Costs</strong></p>
              <p>We reserve the right to charge you for providing access to your Personal Information. Those fees and charges will not be excessive, and will be determined by us from time to time and we will notify you of those costs prior to providing you with access to the Personal Information. We may require those costs to be paid prior to providing you with access.</p>
              <p><strong>5.6 Correction of Personal Information</strong></p>
              <p> (a) It is your responsibility to ensure that the information you provide to us is accurate and to update your Personal Information as necessary.<br>
                <br>
                (b) If at any time you wish to correct any Personal Information held by us, please contact us as specified in clause 1 and we will correct this record, having regard to the purpose for which it is held, to ensure that the information is accurate, up to date, complete, relevant and not misleading. If we elect not to correct your information, we will notify you, within a reasonable time, of the reason for our refusal, the mechanisms available for you to complain about our refusal and such other matters as required by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) or other applicable law.<br>
                <br>
                (c) If:<br>
                <br>
                (i) we correct Personal Information about you that we previously disclosed to another entity to which the Australian Privacy Principles apply; and<br>
                (ii) you request us to notify that other entity of the correction, we will take reasonable steps in the circumstances to give that notification unless it is impracticable or unlawful to do so. <br>
                <br>
                (d) If we are not satisfied that the Personal Information is not accurate, complete or up to date, we will, at your request, keep with your Personal Information a statement noting your claim that the Personal Information is not accurate, complete or up to date.<br>
                <br>
                (e) If you wish to have your Personal Information deleted, please let us know and we will take all reasonable steps to delete it, unless we need to keep it for legal reasons. </p>
              <p><strong>5.7 Refusal to Correct</strong></p>
              <p>If at any time we refuse or deny access to Personal Information to you or refuse to correct Personal Information we will provide you with reasons for such denial or refusal.</p>

              <p><strong>6.1  Complaint</strong></p>
