**Use of “cookies”**

Cultural Care Au Pair uses a technology nicknamed “cookies”. Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record keeping purposes. They tell us how and when pages on our site are visited and by how many people.

Cookies do not collect personally identifiable information, although they do identify a user’s computer. We do not combine information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information in order to detect who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent this. If you do so however, you may not be able to take full advantage of our web site. The complete online reservation process can for example only be accessed if you accept cookies.

As you browse our site, advertising cookies will be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in.  This enables us or our partners to present you with retargeting advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with our site. The techniques our partners employ do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address or telephone number.  You can visit this [page ](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)to opt out of targeted advertising.

**The Way We Use Information**

Personal information collected by Culturalcare.com is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. We use the information you provide about someone else for the ‘refer a family’ program to contact that potential family about the program.  We do not share this information with outside parties. If you request our catalog or updates about our products and services, then we may also use that information to inform you of new offers, products and services which may be of interest to you. Culturalcare.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifying information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
