# Cultural Care Au Pair | Privacy Policy

Our Commitment to Your Privacy  
  
Cultural Care Au Pair is committed to protecting the privacy of our online users. We would like to share our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, it is available in the navigation bar at the bottom of every page and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the culturalcare.com website.

Collection of Personal Information  
  
On our site, you can request information, refer host families, download the host family application, and access your online account. Culturalcare.com maintains the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information that we obtain from our users. We limit the personally identifiable information we collect to only that which is required to participate with Cultural Care.

Collection of Non Personal Information  
  
We collect site traffic data from cookie usage on our site. We also use information about IP addresses, types of Web browsers, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), referring and exit pages, operating systems, date/time stamps, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses and the like are not linked to personally identifiable information. We also keep track of search terms, so we know what visitors to our site are looking for. We do this so that we may better develop the site to meet the needs of our users. 

The Way We Use Information  
  
We use the information you provide about yourself when requesting information, only to complete that request. We do not share this information with outside parties. Personal information collected by Culturalcare.com is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. However, should you provide personally identifiable information through email exchanges. We will protect your privacy to the best of our ability by monitoring the sessions, but always keep in mind that when you are in a public forum, you control the information you disclose. You should always be careful when distributing your personal information in this manner. We use the information you provide about someone else only to confirm message delivery for the 'refer a family' function. We do not share this information with outside parties. Information you provide to us to create a message is only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the recipient. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. Culturalcare.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifying information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

Reviewing or Changing Your Information  
  
You can access personal information online by providing your host family number and password when prompted at the login. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. You can request changes of factual errors in your personal account via email to your Regional Manager, by calling our toll-free number at (800) 333-6056, or by sending mail to: 

Cultural Care Au Pair

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. 

Your Consent  
  
By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Culturalcare.com. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post any changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. If we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of email. If, however, you have opted out of communication with the site then you will not be contacted, nor will your personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes to our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our website notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
