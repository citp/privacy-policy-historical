  *  **Single sign-ons** : If you choose to register or login using a third party account (such as Google or your Company’s SSO provider), the authentication of your login details are handled by that third party and we only collect the information you expressly agree to share with us at the time you give permission to link your Culture Amp account with the third party account. By using a Google Single Sign-On account (or other supported SSO), you are allowing us to access your Google (or other supported SSO) account information.

When other individuals submit feedback about you, we will also use that information to create graphs or charts that will be displayed on your Personal Profile Page.
  *  **Individual feedback** : You may be asked by your Company to provide feedback for other individuals employed by your Company and other individuals employed by your Company may be asked to provide feedback for you (in each case, a “ **Performance Review** ”). We may send you communications through the Services requesting that you provide a Performance Review about another employee in your Company. When you participate in providing Performance Reviews, other individuals or your Company may be able to review certain information about you, for example the content in the Performance Review. However, Continuous Feedback Messages will only be viewable by you and the person you are sharing Continuous Feedback Messages with. 
  * **Your content** : When you use the Services as an Individual Feedback User, we will store any messages or content that you submit to us when you use this portion of the Services, such as when you exchange Individual Feedback with other individuals (including any messages, pictures, files and video) or submit Performance Reviews, as well as when these messages or files were sent.

You can choose not to participate. 

Each time you (or another user) provides the Authentication Token for your (or their) company email address or the Supported Messaging System, we will use the Authentication Token to collect the last 90 days of email and calendar meta data (consisting of the To, From, cc, bcc, and Timestamp Fields which we refer to as “ **Meta Data** ”) from your (or their) company email address, or the Supported Messaging System. 

Your Meta Data or the Meta Data collected from other individuals at your Company may also include communications made to and from third parties outside of your organization. 

We will use your Meta Data to determine the users within your Company that you communicate with in order to create your Network. The Network is used to send requests for Individual Feedback to the users within your Network. If another user in your Company provides us with Meta Data, and you had communicated with them, it may include your Meta Data also.

If you do not want your Meta Data being used as described in this section, you must notify your Company to not enable ONA network analysis.

## 4\. Who is the data controller or processor?

Data protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the “controller” and “processor” of information. For Administrators,  Respondents and Individual Feedback Users, your company, which is our Customer will generally be the controller of your personal information and Culture Amp will be the processor (unless indicated otherwise in this Privacy Policy). For Visitors, Culture Amp will generally be the controller of your personal information.

## 5\. How do we hold the information we collect?

#### (a) _Security of your personal information_

The security of your personal information is very important to us. All your data is private and confidential and we take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is handled securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We follow generally accepted security standards, to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. Culture Amp is ISO27001 certified.

However, please note that transmitting information over the Internet is never completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee that your personal information is absolutely secure in all situations.

Security is a collaborative effort, so we also recommend that you create a sophisticated password for logging in to our services and keep that password secret.

If you suspect there has been any unauthorized access or misuse of your personal information, immediately contact our Data Protection Officer at [privacy@cultureamp.com](mailto:privacy@cultureamp.com).

If you have any concerns about the security of our platform, contact our Information Security Team at [security@cultureamp.com](mailto:security@cultureamp.com).

#### (b) _Where your personal information is located_

Our servers are based in the United States, so your personal information will generally be processed and hosted in the United States. However, as some of our offices and service providers are located outside of the United States, there may be times when your personal information may be transferred, disclosed or processed in another country, such as Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom. For example, if you contact our Customer Success team for support or questions, any information you provide us in the support request (including personal information such as your name and email address) will be processed and hosted in Ireland by the service provider we use to manage support requests.

#### (c) _European Union or Swiss users_

If you live in the European Union, we will use the following safeguards to transfer your personal information to a country not currently deemed adequate under applicable data protection law:

  * **European Union Standard Contractual Clauses:** Culture Amp offers the European Union Standard Contractual Clauses ( ** _EU SCCs_** ), also known as Model Clauses, to meet the adequacy and security requirements for our Customers that operate in the European Union, and other international transfers of information. We also use the EU SCCs when we transfer your personal information to a member of the Culture Amp Group located in a country not currently deemed adequate under applicable data protection law. A copy of our standard data processing addendum, incorporating the EU SCCs, is available on request.

Transfers of Respondent and Individual Feedback User information to our service providers are covered by our agreement with the Customer.

  *  **Protect our rights or the rights of our staff:** There may be situations where disclosing your personal information is necessary to protect the property, health or safety of Culture Amp or its staff, the Customers or others. For example, exchanging information with other organizations to protect against fraud.
  *  **Keep other entities associated with us informed:** In some cases, we may need to disclose your personal information to our agents, business affiliates, joint venture entities, partners, investors or any applicable subsidiaries or holding companies.

This disclosure will generally not apply to Respondents or Individual Feedback Users.

If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the personal information collected by us and will assume and be subject to all the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

When you use our Services as a Respondent or an Individual Feedback User, we may also disclose your personal information for the purposes of:

  * **Providing the Services:** When you answer Customer surveys, we will disclose that information to the Customer and Administrators. How your answers are displayed and what information may be used to analyze and report your answers (either in an aggregate or individual form) may vary from survey to survey. It is important that you read the Confidentiality Notice before answering a survey so you understand how your survey answers will be used and the ways they might be shared (if at all). Your survey data will also be visible to other employees in your Company each time you share your survey reports, or provide feedback to such employee. Your Company and other employees in your Company will not be able to see your Personal Profile Page, however, your personal information may be used to provide Services to other users in your Network.

For example, we may create aggregated de-identified data to share with customers, prospects, partners for business or research purposes, or for provision of our Services such as our survey benchmarks.
  *  **Fulfilling Customer requests:** Because the Customer is the controller of your personal information, we hold and process your personal information on behalf of the Customer. There may be occasions when the Customer instructs us to disclose your personal information to a third party, such as a consultant or a new service provider. If instructed by the Customer to transfer your personal information to a third party, we will sign a data transfer agreement with the Customer and the third party if required, to ensure that they continue to observe the Confidentiality Notice for each survey. 
  * **Preventing harm:** We may also disclose your personal information to the Customer or relevant authorities if your use of our Services indicates an imminent risk of harm to you or to others around you.
