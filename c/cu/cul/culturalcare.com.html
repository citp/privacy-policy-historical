    <h4>
        Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h4>
    <p>
        Cultural Care Au Pair is committed to protecting the privacy of our online users.
        We would like to share our online information practices and the choices you can
        make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy
        to find, it is available in the navigation bar at the bottom of every page and at
        every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. This notice
        applies to all information collected or submitted on the culturalcare.com website.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>
        Collection of Personal Information</h4>
    <p>
        On our site, you can request information, refer host families, download the host
        family application, and access your online account. Culturalcare.com maintains the
        confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information that we obtain
        from our users. We limit the personally identifiable information we collect to only
        that which is required to participate with Cultural Care.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>
        Collection of Non Personal Information</h4>
    <p>
        We collect site traffic data from cookie usage on our site. We also use information
        about IP addresses, types of Web browsers, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), referring
        and exit pages, operating systems, date/time stamps, and number of clicks to analyze
        trends, administer the site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic
        information for aggregate use. IP addresses and the like are not linked to personally
        identifiable information. We also keep track of search terms, so we know what visitors
        to our site are looking for. We do this so that we may better develop the site to
        meet the needs of our users.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>
        The Way We Use Information</h4>
    <p>
        We use the information you provide about yourself when requesting information, only
        to complete that request. We do not share this information with outside parties.
        Personal information collected by Culturalcare.com is stored in secure operating
        environments that are not available to the public. However, should you provide personally
        identifiable information through email exchanges. We will protect your privacy to
        the best of our ability by monitoring the sessions, but always keep in mind that
        when you are in a public forum, you control the information you disclose. You should
        always be careful when distributing your personal information in this manner. We
        use the information you provide about someone else only to confirm message delivery
        for the 'refer a family' function. We do not share this information with outside
        parties. Information you provide to us to create a message is only used for that
        purpose, and it is only disclosed to the recipient. We use return email addresses
        to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose
        and are not shared with outside parties. Culturalcare.com may provide aggregate
        statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information
        to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally
        identifying information. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifying
        information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above
        without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such
        unrelated uses.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>
        Reviewing or Changing Your Information</h4>
    <p>
        You can access personal information online by providing your host family number
        and password when prompted at the login. We use this procedure to better safeguard
        your information. You can request changes of factual errors in your personal account
        via email to your Program Director, by calling our toll-free number at (800) 333-6056,
        or by sending mail to:

        One Education Street<br>
        Cambridge, MA 02141<br>
        <br>
        To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify
        your identity before granting access or making corrections.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>
        Your Consent</h4>
    <p>
        By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this information
        by Culturalcare.com. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post any
        changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect,
        how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. If we are going to use
        your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated
        at the time of collection we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as
        to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. If we decide
        to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated
        at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of email. If, however,
        you have opted out of communication with the site then you will not be contacted,
        nor will your personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we
        make any material changes to our privacy practices that do not affect user information
        already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our website notifying
        users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users
        who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes
        in our privacy practices.
