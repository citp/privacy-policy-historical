# Privacy Policy | Cult Beauty

At Cult Beauty (Cult Beauty Limited) we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy sets out our privacy practices for the Cult Beauty website. Please take the time to review this Privacy Policy carefully as it tells you how your personal information will be treated by us.

By using the Cult Beauty website (the “Site”) and our services, you unconditionally agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.

Cult Beauty wants to offer you the best possible internet experience; consequently, additional functions, features, products or services are incorporated into the Site from time to time. This, and our commitment to protecting the privacy of your personal information, may result in periodic changes to this Privacy Policy. As a result, please remember to refer back to this Privacy Policy regularly to review any amendments.

Any questions regarding our Privacy Policy should be directed to Cult Beauty’s Privacy Policy Manager at [privacy@cultbeauty.co.uk](mailto:privacy@cultbeauty.co.uk) or alternatively see the Contact Us page on this Site.

**What do we collect and use personal information for?**

In order to:

  * reply to your enquiries and requests for information;
  * receive and process orders submitted by you;
  * customise the service we provide to you;
  * carry out our obligations in relation to any agreement you have with us;
  * verify your identity;
  * anticipate and resolve problems with any goods or services supplied to you;
  * carry out market research and tracking of sales data;
  * send you newsletters, surveys or other information about our products and services by post, e-mail or SMS.
  * publish on the Site, at our discretion, your Submission comments.



We may need to collect and process personal information about you including your name, age, address and contact details such as your telephone number and e-mail address. If you place an order with us, we will also ask for your payment details. We may ask you for this information through our Site, or via one of our telephone operators, or we may collect this information through your e-mail or other communications with us. Certain information is collected automatically, as described later in this Privacy Policy.

We also ask you for other optional information such as what sort of device you use such as a mobile telephone or PDA or tablet, how you heard about our Site and what sort of subjects interest you. If you choose to give us this information, we will use it to help us to provide you with the best possible service that is personalised to your needs and preferences. Although we do not make it compulsory to give us every item of information we ask for, the more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we can tailor our services for you.

**Log files/IP addresses**

When you visit our Site, we automatically log your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet) which is automatically recognised by our web server. We use IP addresses to help us administer the Site and to collect broad demographic information for aggregate use. Your IP address is also logged when you make a purchase as a fraud prevention measure required by the payment gateway.

**Credit and debit card information**

If you select the option to allow us to store your card details, then we will do so using the Sage Pay Token System. If you select a Repeat Purchase Product, then we will automatically store your card details via the Sage Pay Token System.

The Token System is a safe way of Cult Beauty keeping card details without actually storing them. Sage Pay store and convert a customer's sensitive payment information into a secure token or "alias". This token is then used by Cult Beauty to process future transactions as and when required, without asking for your card details each time.

**Non-personal information**

We may automatically collect non-personal information about you such as the type of internet browsers you use or the site from which you linked to our Site. You cannot be identified from this information and it is only used to assist us in providing an effective service on our Site. We may from time to time supply the owners or operators of third party sites from which it is possible to link to our Site with information relating to the number of users linking to our Site from their sites. You cannot be identified from this information.

**Information placed on your computer**

We may store some information (commonly known as a “cookie”) on your computer when you look at our Site. This information facilitates your use of our Site and helps us to understand how our Site is used. You can erase or block cookies from your computer if you want to (your help screen or manual should tell you how to do this), but certain Cult Beauty services may not work correctly or at all if you set your browser not to accept cookies.

Please refer to our Cookie Policy for detailed information.

**Improving our service**

Staff from Cult Beauty, or from our service providers, may contact you from time to time using the contact means you have supplied to us in order to get your views and comments on the service we provide to you.

**Information about products and services.**

It is very important to us that we provide you with the highest level of service. In order to help us do this, from time to time we may contact you using one of the contact methods you have provided, with details of our newsletters, surveys, products and services which we think may be of interest to you. If at any time you do not wish to receive these details, then send an e-mail message titled “unsubscribe” to [info@cultbeauty.co.uk](mailto:info@cultbeauty.co.uk). Please note that active customers will continue to receive order and account communications from us.

**Keeping our records accurate**

We aim to keep our information about you as accurate as possible. If you would like to review or change the details you have supplied us with, or you would like to remove your published Submission from the Site you may do so at any time by using the Contact Us page on this Site.

**Security**

You should be aware that the internet is an insecure environment. We have implemented technology and employee policies to help safeguard your privacy from unauthorised access and improper use. We will continue to update these measures, as appropriate, when new technology becomes available.

When you purchase goods on our Site, you will be automatically directed to a secure server site that is managed and controlled by SagePay (www.sagepay.com). You can view their security policy here: <http://www.sagepay.com/security_policy>. Cult Beauty will only pass information to SagePay via secure server software ("SSL") to encrypt and therefore protect ordering information. All personal data that you supply to SagePay shall be governed by SagePay’s data protection and privacy policy. Cult Beauty accepts no liability for any use made by SagePay of such personal data.

**Third party sites**

We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other third party sites, or for advertisers on our site, even if you access them using links from our Site and we recommend that you check the policy of each site you visit. In addition, if you linked to our Site from a third party site, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners or operators of that third party site and we recommend that you check the policy of that third party site and contact its owner or operator if you have any concerns or questions.

Unless expressly stated, we are not agents for these third party sites or for any third party advertisers on our Site, nor are we authorised to make representations on their behalf.

**Transferring your personal information outside the European Economic Area**

We may need, as part of the services offered to you though our Site, to communicate your details outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). By way of example, this may happen if any of our servers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EEA or one of our service providers is located in a country outside of the EEA.

We are obliged to satisfy ourselves before transferring your information to a country outside the EEA that it provides adequate protection for your data protection rights. The EEA comprises of the EU countries and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Countries outside the EEA may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA.

If we do transfer your information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.

Our Site is hosted on servers located in the United Kingdom.

**Disclosing your information to others**

Other than the disclosures referred to in this policy, we will not disclose any personal information without your permission unless we are legally entitled or obliged to do so (for example, if required to do so by Court Order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime).

We will only disclose and/or transfer your personal information to a third party either as part of a reorganisation or a sale of the assets of a Cult Beauty, or having ensured that steps have first been taken to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.

**Contacting us**

If at any time you would like to contact us with your views about our privacy practices, or with any enquiry relating to your personal information, you can do so by sending an e-mail to us at [privacy@cultbeauty.co.uk](mailto:privacy@cultbeauty.co.uk). You are entitled to ask for a copy of the information we store about you (for which we may charge a small fee) and can ask for that information to be corrected or erased where appropriate.
