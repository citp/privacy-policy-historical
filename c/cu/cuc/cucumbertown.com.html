        <p>Cucumbertown allows its users, via the Cucumbertown website (http://cucumbertown.com) (the "Website"), to participate in a simple recipe blogging platform allowing amateur cooks to develop devoted followings (collectively, the "Cucumbertown Service").  The Cucumbertown Service is owned and operated by Cucmbertown, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Cucumbertown", "we" or "us").</p>

        <p>Your use of the Website and the Cucumbertown Service is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy").</p>

        <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, EXIT THIS PAGE AND DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE OR THE CUCUMBERTOWN SERVICE.</strong></p>

        <p>We are committed to respect and protect the privacy of the personal information we obtain from you through our Website and we have created this Privacy Policy to inform you about how we collect, use and share your personal information, and our privacy practices in general.</p>

        <p>We are always ready to address your questions and concerns regarding this policy and our privacy practices. If you would like to contact Customer Service, please contact us via <a href="mailto:privacy@cucumbertown.com">privacy@cucumbertown.com</a>.</p>

        <p>We continually strive to find new ways to enhance your experience with the Website and the Cucumbertown Service and we may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our privacy practices.  You are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically and to check the "Last Updated" date at the top of the Privacy Policy for the most recent version.  If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of notice on the Website or otherwise through the Cucumbertown Service.</p>

        <h2>1.  Terms of Service.</h2>

        <p>Use of the Website and the Cucumbertown Service is subject to the terms of our <a href="/tos">Terms of Service</a>, which is hereby incorporated into and made part of this Privacy Policy.  Please carefully review our Terms of Service. By using the Website or the Cucumbertown Service, you agree to be bound by the terms of our Terms of Service.</p>

        <h2>2.  Types and Uses of Collected Information.</h2>

        <p>Cucumbertown collects two types of information about you:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>a.  Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific person. When you engage in certain activities on this Website or through your participation in the Cucumbertown Service, including but not limited to creating an account, sending feedback, or otherwise participating in the Cucumbertown Service (collectively, "Identification Activities"), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself.  If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your name, address (including zip code), email address, telephone number, and date of birth.  When you enroll in the Cucumbertown Service, we may also ask you to provide us with additional information, such as credit card information. Depending on the Identification Activity, some of the information we ask you to provide may be identified as mandatory and some identified as voluntary.  If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular Identification Activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that Identification Activity.  Depending on the Identification Activity, Cucumbertown may not re-ask you for Personally Identifiable Information if such are already stored with us under the Cucumbertown Service.</p>

                <p>If you choose to refer someone through the Cucumbertown Service, we will ask you for your referral's contact information, such as his or her name and email address. We may then send your friend an email inviting him or her to visit the Website and/or join the Cucumbertown Service. Cucumbertown stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this email and maintaining the Cucumbertown Service. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@cucumbertown.com">privacy@cucumbertown.com</a> to request that we remove his or her contact information from our records.</p>

                <p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information to provide products and/or services to you, administer sweepstakes and contests, enhance the operation of the Website and the Cucumbertown Service, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website and Cucumbertown Service use, improve the Website and the Cucumbertown Service, and to tailor your experience with third parties as provided below in this Privacy Policy.  If you use our Website or the Cucumbertown Service to send information to another person, we may store your personal information. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><strong>b.  Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific person. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming to our Website or otherwise participating in the Cucumbertown Service, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website or the Cucumbertown Service, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, or general and/or aggregated location data that does constitute Personally Identifiable Information. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website or use the Cucumbertown Service through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described below in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <p>We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website and the Cucumbertown Service, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Release of Personally Identifiable Information.</h2>

        <p>We will not sell or share your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided below:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>a.  Authorized Third Party Service Providers.</strong> Cucumbertown may provide services and products through third parties. These "Third Party Service Providers" perform functions on our or your behalf. You or We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, move data in or out of the Cucumbertown Service, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, operate the Website and the Cucumbertown Service, troubleshoot, and provide customer service. We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies ("Affiliates") with whom we have business relationships and may share your information with Third Party Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks.  We encourage Affiliates and Third Party Service Providers to adopt and post privacy policies.  However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.</li>

            <li><strong>b.  Remarketing.</strong> Remarketing is a way for Cucumbertown to connect with people, based upon your past interactions with the Website and/or the Cucumbertown Service. Third-party marketing vendors may be hired by Cucumbertown to perform remarketing services. As a result, third-party vendors, including Google, may show Cucumbertown ads on sites on the Internet.

            <li><strong>c.  Acquisition.</strong> As with any other company, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.</li>

            <li><strong>d.  As required by law.</strong> We reserve the right to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, Terms of Service or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, users of the Cucumbertown Service, employers, or others.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</h2>

        <p>We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Affiliates and Third Party Service Providers, and Third Party Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information (which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) with "Third Party Advertisers" or "Third Party Advertising Companies."</p>

        <p>We may use Third Party Advertising Companies to serve ads when you visit our Website or participate in the Cucumbertown Service. These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits to this Website, your use of the Cucumbertown Service, and visits to other websites or locations in order to provide, through the use of network tags, advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.</p>

        <p>We also use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our users to administer our Website and the Cucumbertown Service, in order to constantly improve their quality. We may also publish this information for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for Third Party Advertisers.

You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on the Website or through the Cucumbertown Service. Additionally, it may be impossible for us to completely delete all of your information because we periodically backup information.</p>

        <h2>5. Choices on Collection/Use of Information.</h2>

        <p>You can always choose not to provide certain information, although a certain level of information is required to engage in activities on the Website and to participate in the Cucumbertown Service.</p>
