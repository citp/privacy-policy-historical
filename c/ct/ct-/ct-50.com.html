<h2>1. Collection of Information.</h2>
<h3>1.1 Survey Information.</h3>
<p>Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites&nbsp;collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites survey, order form, or a registration pages either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys,&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, health history, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information").&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites.</p>
<h3>1.2 Other Information.</h3>
<p>Other occasions when Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites obtain information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").</p>
<h3>1.3 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</h3>
<p>Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites&nbsp;currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally,&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").</p>
<h3>(a) Cookies.</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.</p>
<h3>(b) Web Beacons.</h3>
<p>A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example,&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where clothing products are sold. When Amy, an individual listed in&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites database, visits the clothing website,&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. receives notice by means of the web beacon that Amy visited the Clothing site, and&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. would then update Amy's profile with the information that Amy is interested in clothing.&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. may thereafter present offers of clothing related products and services to Amy. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Warrior Media, Inc. also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Warrior Media, Inc. database.</p>
<h3>(c) New Technology.</h3>
<p>The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Warrior Media, Inc. strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.</p>
<h3>1.4 Outside Information.</h3>

<h3>1.5 Individual Information.</h3>
<p>As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites gathers or receives about individuals.</p>
<h3>1.6 No Information Collected from Children.</h3>
<p>Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites&nbsp;will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information,&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties.&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").</p>
<h3>1.7 Credit Card Information.</h3>

When the Credit Card Information is submitted to Warrior Media, Inc., such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software.&nbsp;Warrior Media, Inc. will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.</p>
