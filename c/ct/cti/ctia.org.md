# CTIA.ORG Website Privacy Policy

CTIA is committed to protecting the privacy of CTIA.ORG® users personal information. This privacy statement applies with respect to the information that CTIA collects from its CTIA.ORG® Website, located at [www.CTIA.ORG](http://www.ctia.org/).  Amendments to this privacy statement will be posted at this URL and will be effective when posted. Your continued use of this site following the posting of any amendment, modification or change shall constitute your acceptance thereof.

   
We collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP address, computer settings or most-recently visited URL. We may also ask you to provide certain non-personally identifiable information about yourself, such as your age, household income, your profession, buying preferences, etc. We do not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to the CTIA.ORG® Website by, for example, filling out a survey or registration form. The types of information that may be requested include your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.

  
CTIA may use the information to tell you about CTIA.ORG® products or services or other industry-related products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Personally identifiable information may be used to contact you again either by online electronic communication (such as e-mail), or by regular mail or telephone. CTIA.ORG® users may opt-out of receiving future mailings or information from CTIA by unsubscribing to [webmaster@ctia.org](mailto:webmaster@ctia.org).

 Non-personal demographic and profile data is used to tailor your experience at the CTIA.ORG® Website, showing you content we think you might be interested in. This information may also be shared with advertisers on an aggregate, non-personal basis. When CTIA shares such information with advertisers, it is not traceable to any particular user and will not be used to contact you again.

 CTIA hosts several industry-leading events each year, including the world's largest WIRELESS® show as well as other groundbreaking conferences. CTIA offers on-line registration for these events at the CTIA.ORG® Website. We may use the information that you provide on the on-line registration form to tell you about future events by CTIA and/or its affiliates that we feel may be of interest to you.  We may also share this information with CTIA’s carefully selected business partners and third parties entities from whom we believe you may want to receive information concerning wireless-related products or services. Personally identifiable information may be used to contact you again either by online electronic communication (such as e-mail), or by regular mail or telephone. CTIA.ORG® users that register on-line for CTIA events may opt-in to receive future mailings from CTIA and its affiliates or from CTIA’s business partners and other carefully entities by selecting the appropriate box on the on-line registration form.

   
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the CTIA.ORG® Website.

   
When you view the CTIA.ORG® Website we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on the CTIA.ORG® Website. Cookies do not spy on you or otherwise invade your privacy, and they cannot invade your hard drive and steal information. Rather, they help you navigate a website as easily as possible. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. Cookies can allow the CTIA.ORG® Website to remember you when you return so you do not have to enter your registration data at each connection.

  
While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, CTIA takes reasonable steps to protect the security and confidentiality of your personal information.  We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personally identifiable information transmitted to us using the CTIA.ORG® Website. To guard your information, the CTIA.ORG® Website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) as well as other industry standard security measures for online transactions at the CTIA.ORG® Wesbsite.  Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information.

The CTIA.ORG® Website contains links to other websites. CTIA is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

   
CTIA allows its users the option to change or modify information previously provided. This may be done through the following methods:

1\.  E-mail the information to [webmaster@ctia.org](mailto:webmaster@ctia.org); or 

2.  Visit the Registration Section of the CTIA.ORG® Website and follow   
     the appropriate instructions.

CTIA will use reasonable efforts to ensure that your information is removed from or corrected in our records.

   
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with the CTIA.ORG® Website, you can contact us at [webmaster@ctia.org](mailto:webmaster@ctia.org).
