# CTIA - Privacy Policy

We collect information about you in two ways:

  1. information you provide to us, and
  2. information we collect automatically.



 **Information you provide.  **When you make a purchase, set up an account with us, or communicate with us by any means, you voluntarily provide information to us. For example, when you go to our website and sign up to receive our CTIA Mobile Minute™ mailer, you provide us with your name and email address. Similarly, if you make a purchase through our online store, you provide us with your contact and billing information such as your name, address, and payment card number. Whenever you provide information to us, we may use that information to communicate with you about your use of our services (including any relevant service updates and promotions) and our website.

 **Co-sponsorships.  **If you provide your information to us in order to register for an event or a promotion that we sponsor with another organization, or if you visit a co-sponsored site, or use a service that we promote through a partnership with another organization, you also may be providing information to our co-sponsor. In that instance, you should refer to that co-sponsor or partner’s privacy policy for information about its practices, which may differ from those of CTIA.

 **Information we collect automatically.**  To deliver a more personalized experience, when you visit our website or use our services, we automatically collect certain pieces of information. The information that we collect includes the device you use to access our website, the pages you visit, the time you spend on our website, the links that you click on and follow, the search terms you enter, how often you access an application or portion of the website, and how long you spend on our website.
