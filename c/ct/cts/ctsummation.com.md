# Summation: Privacy Notice

**Information about Summation Legal Technologies’ Online Privacy Policy**

CT Summation (“Summation”) respects your privacy. When using our Web sites and pages, you may get information, access products and services, communicate with us or link to other Web sites with which we do business. While doing that, you may give us information so that we can provide enhanced products or services to you and to personalize your experience on our Web site. This online privacy policy describes how we use and protect Personally Identifiable Information that you share with us. "Personally Identifiable Information" (hereinafter referred to as “personal information”) is information that enables us to identify you, such as your name, email address, phone number, title and mailing address. 

This policy governs Web sites owned and operated by Summation. Our policy does not govern Web sites of other parties to which we may provide links, because Summation is not responsible, and cannot control the privacy practices or content of those sites.

Collection of Your Personal Information 

We will ask you when we need personal information that allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are ordering demonstration software, requesting information about a product or service, registering for a seminar, joining a limited-access page such as our Knowledge Base, or signing up for an event or training. Personal information collected by Summation often is limited to name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and product usage, but may include other information when needed to provide information or a service you requested. We keep this information on file. We use your personal information to deliver information, products, and services that you request and to allow you access to limited-entry areas on our Web site.

Summation also automatically receives and records certain information on our server logs about your computer hardware and software. This information may include: your IP address, browser type, operating system, domain name, access times and referring Web site addresses. Summation also collects information about which pages our customers visit on our Web site. This site visitation data is identified only by a unique ID number, and it is never linked with personal information unless a user consents as described below. Summation does not utilize cookies. This information is used to provide general statistics regarding use of Summation’s Web site, ensure our Web site is relevant to your needs, and to help us create and publish content and products most relevant to you.

Control of Your Personal Information

Summation will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone. Summation will send personal information about you to other companies or people only when we: (1) have your consent to share the information; (2) need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested (e.g. obtaining CLE credits from the State Bar); (3) need to send the information to companies who work with or on behalf of Summation to provide a product or service to you (unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personal information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.); (4) respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process. Summation shares personal information with its subsidiary, CaseVault, but only to provide individuals with information about CaseVault services offered through Summation.

Summation will occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf (e.g. mailing services). We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Changes to Your Information

Summation does not provide an online method from its Web site to change personal information. However, Summation does comply with the CAN-SPAM bill and provides the requisite Opt-Out options. If you would like to change your personal information, you may contact us at 800-735-7866 or 415-442-0404.

Changes to this Statement

Summation will occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. Prior privacy statements will be available upon request.
