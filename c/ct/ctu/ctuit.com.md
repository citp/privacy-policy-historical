This information is used by Ctuit Software for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Ctuit Software Web site.

Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Ctuit Software public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: Ctuit Software does not read any of your private online communications.

Ctuit Software encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Ctuit Software so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. Ctuit Software is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the Ctuit Software and Ctuit Software family of Web sites.

Use of your Personal Information

Ctuit Software collects and uses your personal information to operate the Ctuit Software Web site and deliver the services you have requested. Ctuit Software also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Ctuit Software and its affiliates. Ctuit Software may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

Ctuit Software does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Ctuit Software may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Ctuit Software may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries.

Ctuit Software keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within Ctuit Software, in order to determine what Ctuit Software services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Ctuit Software to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

Ctuit Software Web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Ctuit Software or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Ctuit Software; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Ctuit Software, or the public.

Use of Cookies

The Ctuit Software Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Ctuit Software pages, or register with Ctuit Software site or services, a cookie helps Ctuit Software to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Ctuit Software Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Ctuit Software features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Ctuit Software services or Web sites you visit.

Security of your Personal Information

Ctuit Software secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Ctuit Software secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

Changes to this Statement

Ctuit Software will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Ctuit Software encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Ctuit Software is protecting your information.
