## CHILDREN UNDER 13

Our Platform is generally intended for adults. From time to time, select features on our Platform may be available to children under the age of 13 ("Children") and, in certain instances, we may be required to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). To meet our obligations under COPPA when applicable, we take steps to obtain consent from parents or legal guardians prior to collecting, using and disclosing personal information from their Children. We also strive to collect the minimum amount of personal information from Children necessary to provide them with the services requested and communicate with them. Such personal information may include contact information, demographic information and device information (as described in "Types of Information We Collect"). We use and disclose this information as indicated in "How We Use Your Information" and "How We Share Your Information." In addition, personal information submitted by Children may be publically available on our platform.

COPPA grants parents and legal guardians the rights to review or have deleted their Children's personal information, and to refuse to permit further collection or use of their Children's personal information. If you are a parent or legal guardian and would like to exercise these rights, please contact us at [privacy.policy@unilever.com](mailto:privacy.policy@unilever.com). You can also contact us at the address or telephone number listed at the end of this Policy. Please mark your inquiries “COPPA Information Request.” You can also learn more about how to protect children's privacy on-line [here](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online).
