Thank you for visiting our Web site and reviewing our privacy policy. Our privacy policy is clear: We will not collect any personal information about you when you visit our Web site unless you choose to provide that information to us. 

Here is how we handle information about your visit to our Web site: 

Information Collected and Stored Automatically: If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the Web site, do searches, read pages, or download information, we will automatically gather and store certain information about your visit. This information does not identify you personally. No information about users/visitors will be sold, shared, or utilized in any commercial way. We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit: 

  1. The Internet domain (for example, “company.com” if you use a private Internet access account, or “yourschool.edu” if you connect from a university’s domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our Web site;

WE DO NOT TRACK OR RECORD INFORMATION ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR VISITS. 

Sometimes we write a small file on the user’s computer called a “session cookie.” Session cookies automatically expire when users leave a Web site; session cookies retain information only during the session or for the purpose of completing a particular online transaction, without any capacity to track users over time and across different Web sites. Other than a session cookie, and the six items described above, we do not obtain any information from the user or the user's computer. We do not use “persistent cookies,” and we fully comply with the HHS IRM Policy for Usage of Persistent Cookies, HHS-IRM-2000-0009; this policy prohibits the use of persistent cookies and permits the use of session cookies.

  4. The e-mail material, including your e-mail address and/or name will in no way be correlated or linked to the material that is automatically collected as described above. The only exceptions to item 4 above would be pursuant to a bona fide Court Order.
  5. We do not collect information for commercial marketing.



The use we will make of your information is to— 

  1. Consider your suggestions.
  2. Possibly respond directly to you for clarification.
  3. Process your request for materials if you make one.
