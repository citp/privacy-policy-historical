# Privacy Policy - SuiteCRM

SalesAgility Ltd. (“SalesAgility”) operates several websites including suitecrm.com. It is SalesAgility’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites. We take all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorized access to and use of your personal data. Our staff maintain a responsibility to keep your information confidential and will only use it to offer relevant products and services related to your inquiry.

## Our Cookies Policy

By using this website you are consenting to our use of the cookies outlined below. We are not responsible for the use or data collected in any cookies set by third parties. Details of how to control and delete cookies are listed below.

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. Cookies are not programs and therefore cannot contain viruses or other malicious software. They are purely a string of text and numbers. This website uses cookies as outlined below to help tailor and make our website and your browsing experience better.

## What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our website?

Like most website operators, SalesAgility collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SalesAgility’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SalesAgility’s visitors use its website. From time to time, SalesAgility may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

SalesAgility Productivity only collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on suitecrm.com blogs or suitecrm forum. SalesAgility only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to SalesAgility’s websites choose to interact with SalesAgility in ways that require SalesAgility to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that SalesAgility gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who request a demo at suitecrm.com to provide data like a name and email address. SalesAgility does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## How do we use your information?

SalesAgility may collect anonymous statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, SalesAgility may monitor the most popular articles on the suitecrm.com site.

We use the self-hosted marketing automation tool Mautic to improve the experience of the visitors. A visitors remain anonymous in the self-hosted Mautic, until they decide to interact with us via a form, providing us with their personal data. Once the visitor has left his data, we may use it to provide automatic email replies and personalized content (for example, an automatic email reply when a demo is requested).

SalesAgility does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## How do we protect Certain Personally-Identifying Information?

SalesAgility discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that

  1. need to know that information in order to process it on SalesAgility’s behalf or to provide services available at SalesAgility’s websites, and
  2. that have agreed not to disclose it to others.



Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; we will follow GDPR guidelines for the transfer of such information to them. SalesAgility will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organisations, as described above, SalesAgility discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a witness summons, court order, or other governmental request, or when SalesAgility believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of SalesAgility, third parties or the public at large.

If you are a registered user of a SalesAgility website and have supplied your email address, and you have opted in for “I wish to get monthly up-to-date info about SuiteCRM releases, security patches and other SuiteCRM news”, SalesAgility may send you a monthly email to keep you up to date about SuiteCRM related news. If you have opted in for “I wish to get info about SuiteCRM support options and SuiteAssured” SalesAgility may occasionally send you an email to tell you about professional services, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with SalesAgility and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. SalesAgility takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
