La Touraine, Inc.</span> <i>("us," "we," or "Company")</i> is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its members, visitors, and all users of NaughtyAmerica.com (the "Site"). We created this La Touraine, Inc.

The Privacy Policy will explain the information we routinely collect during the operation of the Site and how we utilize it to maximize your experience.</p>

        <p class="subhead-text"><span>B. The Privacy Policy</span> is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection, storage, or use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. Your selection of an ad banner or link may redirect you from the Site to a third party website. Company has no control over and no liability for any third party websites, materials, or for the privacy practices of any such third party website. You should direct any concerns regarding any external link to the third party site's administrator or webmaster.</p>

        <p class="subhead-text"><span>C. Company's Site</span> contains sexually explicit material and is not intended to be viewed by anyone under the age of 18 or who has not reached the age of majority in their community. Membership and access to the Site are expressly and strictly limited to adults at least 18 years of age who have reached the age of majority in their community.</p>

        <p class="head-text"><span>II. INFORMATION COLLECTION POLICY</span></p>

        <p class="subhead-text" id="section2a"><span>A. TRAFFIC DATA COLLECTED.</span></p>

        <p class="subsubhead-text"><span>1)</span> In order to collect certain information, we utilize small pieces of data that are placed on a user's computer when the user visits the Site ("Cookies"). Some Cookies are stored in a user's web browser and become inactive when the user closes his/her web browser or turns off his/her computer ("Session Cookies"). Other Cookies are longer lasting and reside on a user's hard drive ("Persistent Cookies"). Persistent Cookies remain on a user's computer until the Persistent Cookies expire or are manually deleted. Persistent Cookies may contain email addresses or usernames, but that data is encrypted and can only be interpreted by Company.</p>

        <p class="subsubhead-text"><span>2)</span> We use Cookies to recognize you when you return to the Site, which allows for easier login, customization of your experience, and overall Site efficiency. We also set Cookies for various tracking and user profiling purposes, such as identifying the pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct while on the Site. Additionally, we use cookies to track sales and to facilitate payout agreements with our affiliates when appropriate.</p>

        <p class="subsubhead-text"><span>3)</span> In the administration of the Site, we use third party software solutions such as NATS and Google Analytics which also utilize Cookies ("Third Party Cookies"). Through the use of internal methods and the use of Third Party Cookies, we automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit the Site: (a) your IP address (which allows us to determine your geographic location); (b) domain servers; (c) type of computer used to access the Site; and (d) type of web browser used to access the Site (collectively "Traffic Data").</p>

        <p class="subsubhead-text"><span>4)</span> Google Analytics has access to the information collected by the Third Party Cookies contained in their software; however, that data is anonymous. With that exception, at this time, we do not share information collected by Cookies with third parties.</p>

        <p class="subsubhead-text"><span>5)</span> Most web browsers allow a user to disable Cookies. While allowing Cookies is not a requirement for membership or use of the Site, if you elect to disable Cookies, some of the Site features will not function properly as the Site was not designed to operate without Cookies.</p>

        <p class="subhead-text"><span>B. PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED.</span></p>

        <p class="subsubhead-text"><span>1)</span> In order to become a member of the Site (a "Member"), and/or to purchase products offered through the Site, you are required to provide certain information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") to one of our transaction processors (the "Processing Agent").</p>

        <p class="subsubhead-text"><span>2)</span> Personal Information includes the following categories of information: (a) your name and email address ("Contact Data"); (b) your zip code ("Demographic Data"); and (c) your credit card, telephone, or account number ("Financial Data"). The Processing Agent provides us with your Contact Data and Demographic Data, which we store. The Processing Agent does not provide us access to your Financial Data and therefore we have no ability to collect, store, or transfer that information.</p>

        <p class="subsubhead-text"><span>3)</span> In order to create a free account, we require you to provide your email address. This email address will be used to send you a confirmation email which you can use to activate your free account.</p>

Please be aware that any information that you disclose in chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups is available to the public.
