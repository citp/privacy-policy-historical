**SURFLINE COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED  **

This Privacy Policy explains SURFLINE’s treatment of your personally identifiable information collected in connection with your activities on or related to all SURFLINE website referencing this Privacy Policy (the "Surfline Site") and all services made available on the SURFLINE Site (collectively, unless noted otherwise, the "Surfline Services"). SURFLINE acknowledges and respects the privacy of all of its users and is committed to protecting such privacy in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy also explains how you can ask questions and make suggestions about our privacy practices and review and update your personal information. 

Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies or websites which are not owned or controlled by SURFLINE. We advise that you read this Privacy Policy carefully and check periodically as this Privacy Policy may change from time to time.

**INFORMATION COLLECTED  **

In the course of operating the SURFLINE Services, we may collect two types of information about our users: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. 

"Personal Information" is personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, birth date and gender and/or your company contact information. Personal Information is collected by us when you choose to provide it to us when registering for a SURFLINE Service you choose to subscribe to, when you enter a SURFLINE promotion or choose to receive a SURFLINE newsletter. In addition, if you choose to contact any of our customer service representatives, we may keep a record of that correspondence so that we may fully address the subject matter. We may also receive Personal Information from our business partners and other third parties, provided that such third parties confirm to us that you have permitted them to share such information. We will use this information to reply to your inquiries, to provide you with requested products and services, to set up your member's account, and to contact you regarding new products and services.

Business contact information such as the name, title, business address, email address or telephone number of a business or professional person or an employee of an organization is not considered Personal Information. 

"Non-Personal Information" is information of an anonymous nature, such as an Internet Protocol Address (IP Address), the domain you may have used to access a SURFLINE Service, the type and version of browser or operating system you may be using, and the website you may have come from and visit next. Aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors and average time spent on a SURFLINE Service, is also considered Non-Personal Information. 

SURFLINE derives or collects and uses Non-Personal Information in the course of operating the SURFLINE Services. For example, our Web servers may automatically collect Non-Personal Information which is provided through your browser or stored on a Cookie or through a Web Beacon when you choose to visit a SURFLINE Service. 

**USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION  **

Personal Information may be used by SURFLINE for the following purposes: 

Providing you with the SURFLINE Services and information you have requested from us, including your use of the SURFLINE Site. SURFLINE may from time to time use your Personal Information to contact you about changes, enhancements or similar notices related to the SURFLINE Services;  

If you indicated that you were interested in receiving offers or information from SURFLINE or certain of our selected sponsors or advertisers, SURFLINE may send you emailed materials and other mailings about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you.

If you enter a contest or other promotion offered on a SURFLINE Site, we may, under the rules of the promotion, use your name and certain other information to administer the promotion, such as contacting, announcing and promoting the winners of the promotion;  

SURFLINE, if it has reasonable grounds to believe the information could be useful when investigating a contravention of a federal, provincial or foreign law or in order to protect or defend a legal interest, may also use Personal Information. 

**DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION  **

SURFLINE will not sell or rent out your Personal Information to any third parties.

  * Third parties are acting on our behalf as our agents, suppliers or service providers, solely to enable us to more efficiently provide you with the SURFLINE Services. Such entities act under strict contractual controls, requiring them to maintain the confidentiality of all such Personal Information and to use such information solely for purposes related to the provision of the SURFLINE Services; 
  * To facilitate the provision of such SURFLINE Service, such as fulfilling legal requirements, as may be set out in the Terms and Conditions applicable to a SURFLINE Service;

**LINKS TO OTHER SITES AND ADVERTISEMENTS**

A SURFLINE Service may contain links to other websites and services.
