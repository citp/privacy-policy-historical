# Privacy Policy - SureTrader

At MintBroker International (“MBI”), we take your privacy very seriously.

This policy has been updated to adhere to the new GDPR regulation that comes into action 25 May 2018. This new law is built around the principles of transparency and control, something SureTrader feels very strongly about. Your trust is important to us, so keeping your personal information safe and secure remains our top priority.

This website is provided by MBI. When visiting this website and in the course of providing services to you, MBI (“we”, “us” or “our”) may collect personal information about you (“personal data”) either (i) directly when you are asked to provide data (e.g., name, e-mail address and mailing address) or when you email, phone or otherwise contact us; or (ii) indirectly, e.g. via cookies and other technical means to monitor your use of the portal such as access logs, your internet protocol address or profiling to tailor the website to your preferences or to track your use of certain pages of the website, or from third parties who provide us with information about you.

“You” or “your”, in this privacy statement, means you as an individual, rather than any legal entity (such as your employer) which you may represent when you order a service from us via this website.

If you decide to opt-out of marketing-related communications, we may not be able to provide certain features of our Services to you.

MBI requires these service providers to enter into confidentiality agreements with MBI that limit their use of the information that they receive. Such agreements prohibit the service provider from using MBI customer information that they receive other than to carry out the purposes for which the information was disclosed. MBI retains control over your Personal Information and uses appropriate safeguards to ensure the integrity and security of your Personal Information when engaging the service provider.

**Personal information storage and transfers:**

This data is stored securely in The Bahamas.

For Personal Information subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) (“GDPR”) we may transfer your Personal Information outside The Bahamas as described above. This may include countries that do not provide the same level of protection as the laws of your home country (for example, the laws within the EEA or the United States). We will ensure that any such international transfers are made subject to appropriate or suitable safeguards if required by the GDPR or other relevant laws. You may email us at [privacy@suretrader.com](mailto:privacy@suretrader.com) at any time if you would like further information on such safeguards.

**How long we retain your Personal Information:**

Personal Information is retained for as long as necessary to meet legal, regulatory and business requirements. Under the Securities Commission of the Bahamas regulation, client information is required to remain on file for a minimum period of 5 years. Retention periods may be extended if we are required to preserve your Personal Information in connection with litigation, investigations and proceedings. Only after the minimum period is met, can personal information be deleted.

  * Obtaining information regarding the processing of your personal information and access to the personal information that we hold about you.

  * Objecting to, and requesting that we restrict, our processing of your personal information in certain circumstances. Again, there may be circumstances where you object to or ask us to restrict, our processing of your personal information but we are legally entitled to refuse that request;
  * Withdrawing your consent, although in certain circumstances it may be lawful for us to continue processing without your consent if we have another legitimate reason (other than consent) for doing so.
