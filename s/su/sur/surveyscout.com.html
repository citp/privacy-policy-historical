uses for its cookies.<br><br>

First, we use cookies to track special offers and promotions that may

you are not presented with the same special offers and/or promotions
over and over, or after you have indicated you are not interested.<br><br>

Secondly, we use cookies as part of our authenticaton system when 
you login to your account. If you select the "remember me" option when 
logging in, our site will set a cookie so that you do not have to login 
again the next time you visit SurveyScout.com.<br><br>

While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors
to this site always have the option of disabling cookies in their web
browser. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can
