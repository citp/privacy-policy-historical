We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Services. For example, we may collect and analyze information such as (a) IP addresses, geolocation information (as described in the next section below), unique device identifiers and other information about your mobile phone or other mobile device(s), browser types, browser language, operating system, the state or country from which you accessed the Services; and (b) information related to the ways in which you interact with the Services, such as: referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used the Services, the frequency of your use of the Services, error logs, and other similar information. As described further below, we may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting and analyzing this information.

We may also capture other data, such as search criteria and results. In some cases, we will associate this information with a unique identifier for our internal use.

_Location information_

We may collect different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services), and may use that information to customize the Services with location-based information, advertising, and features.

To enhance your experience on our Services, we place "cookies" on your computer or device. Cookies are small text files that we place in your computer or device to store your preferences. Other information you provide to us may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.

We use session and performance cookies to provide you with the services you request and to improve your experience with our Services. For example, we use cookies to personalize your experience on our Services (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site, to save your password in password-protected areas, to enable shopping carts, or to tailor content or product and service offerings). Other cookies are essential to ensure the security and operation of our Services.

We also use cookies (and Local Shared Objects, HTML5, cache cookies, web beacons, or clear gifs, all described further below) to understand usage of the Services, analyze traffic, and to improve our content and offerings.

Some third parties, such as Google, may place cookies on your browser when you use our Services in order to track your activity across websites and to provide you advertisements tailored to your interests and online activities. For more information on how to opt out of Online Behavioral Advertising, see the Exercising Choice section below. For our European based users, we only place or allow tracking cookies to be placed on your browser with your consent.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies. You can set your browser option so that you will not receive cookies and you can also delete existing cookies from your browser.

_Information from third parties_

We may obtain additional information about you from third parties such as marketers, partners, researchers, and others. We may combine information that we collect from you with information about you that we obtain from such third parties and information derived from any other subscription, product, or service we provide.

_Aggregate or de-identified data_

We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information is not intended to identify you. Our use and disclosure of aggregated and/or de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation for any purpose.

#### 4\. EXERCISING CHOICE

**Promotional Emails**

You may opt-out from receiving future promotional emails from us, or direct that we not share your information with any Affiliated Companies, by clicking the "unsubscribe" button that appears on our promotional e-mails. Please refer to the settings or options menu in your email client for more information. You can remove yourself from our postal mailings by emailing us at [privacy@amilink.com](mailto:privacy@amilink.com). You can also remove yourself by contacting us as described in the "How to Contact Us" section below.

**Online Behavioral Advertising**

When you use the Services, we may serve you with ads based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age or gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content and other information that you provide to us.

Some of the services and advertisements are delivered or served by third-party companies. These companies place or recognize cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other technology to track certain information about our Services website users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, an advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of the Services. For another example, an advertiser or ad server may also be able to collect your device’s unique identifier in the course of serving an ad. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests.

We do not have access to, nor control over, these third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used.

For example, we use Google to serve advertisements on the Services, which use the Google Doubleclick cookie, and in some cases, a unique device identifier, to show you ads based on your visit to our websites and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the Google Doubleclick cookie by visiting the _[Google ad and content network privacy policy](https://adssettings.google.com/)_.

If you would like more information about this practice, and to learn how to opt out of behavioral advertising on the particular device on which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, please visit _<http://optout.aboutads.info/#/>_ and _[http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/)_. You may download the AppChoices app at _<http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices>_ to opt out in mobile apps.

Please note that the opt out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer and browser on which the opt out is applied. If you delete your browser cookies and want to continue to be opted out of interest-based ads, you will need to opt out again.

For more information about how we use cookies please visit our [Cookie Policy](https://www.americanmediainc.com/cookie-policy).

#### Precise Device Location Tracking

If you authorized us and/or our service providers to collect and/or share information about the precise location of your device through a mobile application, you can always withdraw your consent and prevent the further collection and sharing of your precise device location information by accessing your devices location privacy settings.

_Right of Deletion_

You have the right to request that our service providers and we delete any Personal Information about yourself that we have collected from you upon receipt of a verifiable request. This right is subject to exceptions.

_Submitting Requests_

You can submit your request by calling us at **1 (888) 914-9661**. You may also submit a request through a webform available by emailing us at [privacy@amilink.com](mailto:privacy@amilink.com).
