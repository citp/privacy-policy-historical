Survival Life understands consumers’ concerns over the use of their personal information. We hope this information will relieve any concerns your company may have regarding our email policies. Survival Life and its affiliated sites use only an “opt-in or opt out” method of obtaining customer information, and it is not our policy or desire to send unsolicited email. We obtain email addresses and personal information from third parties that follow the same set of policies. Survival Life email messages sent always include information about the origin of the emails and instructions on how recipients can unsubscribe from receiving future email messages.

From time to time, Survival Life will enter into an arrangement with a third party website to allow individuals to opt into our marketing program on those third party websites. In each case the third party websites have represented and warranted to us, among other things,

  1. that the data was collected voluntarily from individuals on website registrations and co-registrations,
  2. that the sellers have a right, under any applicable privacy statements, to transfer the data to us, and
  3. that Survival Life has the right to send marketing offers to the individuals.



We hope this information satisfies any questions or concerns you may have regarding the email practices of Survival Life. If you have additional questions or wish to discuss this matter further, please contact us at: supportATSurvivalLifeDOTcom (Please replace “AT” with @ and “DOT” with .)
