</p><p><span style="background-color: #FFE4D1"><b>Survey4Checks.com takes your privacy seriously</b></span>, and has
created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to online privacy. Keep reading to learn
more about our information gathering and dissemination practices, and our use of personally identifiable information.</p>


<p><b>IP Addresses</b></p>

<p>We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our site or web server,
and for the general administration of our website. Your IP address, should
you decide to register and/or create a Survey4Checks account, is also used to

<p><b>Cookies</b></p>

<p>Upon your first visit to this web site, a "cookie" is sent
to your computer. A cookie is a tiny file that identifies you as a

in no way does this tell us who you are. Survey4Checks.com has two primary
uses for its cookies.</p>

<p>First, we use cookies to track special offers and promotions that may
be presented to you as you navigate our website. This is done so that
you are not presented with the same special offers and/or promotions
over and over, or after you have indicated you are not interested.</p>

<p>Secondly, we use cookies as part of our authenticaton system when
you login to your account. If you select the "remember me" option when
logging in, our site will set a cookie so that you do not have to login
again the next time you visit Survey4Checks.com.</p>

<p>While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors
to this site always have the option of disabling cookies in their web
browser. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can
reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie
is being sent.</p>

<p>Please be aware that if you voluntarily disclose
Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat
areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be
collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may
result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third
parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Survey4Checks.com
