                <p><b>Survey4Checks.com
                takes your privacy seriously</b>, and has created this
                Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to
                online privacy. Keep reading to learn more about our information
                gathering and dissemination practices, and our use of personally
                identifiable information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p><b>IP Addresses</b></p>
                <p>We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our
                site or web server, and for the general administration of our
                website. Your IP address, should you decide to register and/or
                create a Survey4Checks account, is also used to help prevent you
                from creating duplicate accounts.</p>
                <p><b>Cookies</b></p>
                <p>Upon your first visit to this web site, a "cookie"
                is sent to your computer. A cookie is a tiny file that
                identifies you as a unique user. It stores personal preferences
                and user data, however, in no way does this tell us who you are.
                Survey4Checks.com has two primary uses for its cookies.</p>
                <p>First, we use cookies to track special offers and promotions
                that may be presented to you as you navigate our website. This
                is done so that you are not presented with the same special
                offers and/or promotions over and over, or after you have
                indicated you are not interested.</p>
                <p>Secondly, we use cookies as part of our authentication system
                when you login to your account. If you select the "remember
                me" option when logging in, our site will set a cookie so
                that you do not have to login again the next time you visit
                Survey4Checks.com.</p>
                <p>While both of these activities depend on the use of a
                "cookie," visitors to this site always have the option
                of disabling cookies in their web browser. Most browsers are
                initially set to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to
                refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.</p>
                <p><b>Information Gathering</b></p>
                <p>This web site collects online contact information in various
                ways, including inquiry forms, registration forms, surveys, and

                information about our company, or to get in touch with the user
                when necessary.</p>
                <p>Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the
                opt-out/modify section below.</p>
                <p><b>Information Dissemination</b></p>
                <p>We may use the personal information that you supply to us and
                we may work with other third party businesses to bring selected

                and applications, including lookup and reference, data
