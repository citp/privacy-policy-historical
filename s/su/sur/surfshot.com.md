What do we mean by aggregate data? By way of example, we may know by analyzing IP addresses that 20% of our users are coming to our Web site from outside of California or that the Bikini of the Day is the second most visited page on our site, and we may tell potential business partners this information. However, we would never say to such a potential partner, you know that dude Chappy Johnson? He likes pintails, eating sushi and traveling to Hawaii in the off-season. Here is his email address and cell phone number.

SurfShot may conduct surveys or other studies of its user base and usage for marketing and planning purposes. Participation in such surveys is at the user’s option. With respect to information collected from such surveys or studies, and in the event that responses are to be publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey and SurfShot will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users and not personal information identifying any specific individual. In cases where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where SurfShot advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, SurfShot reserves the right to disclose text information provided by any user through such a survey, provided that no personal information identifying that user is disclosed. Circumstances under which SurfShot would publicly disclose aggregate information include, but are not limited to, sharing survey results with our business partners, providing data to SurfShot advertisers on user preferences and/or demographics, business planning, and publicizing overall usage data in press communications and business plans.

However, by disabling cookies, certain site features and functionality may no longer work properly, or at all.
