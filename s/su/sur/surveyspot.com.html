            International, LLC’s ("<span>SSI</span>") panels, including
            without limitation SurveySpot Research Panel
            ("<span>SurveySpot</span>"), OpinionWorld Research Panel
            ("<span>OpinionWorld</span>"), any sub-panel(s) of SurveySpot and
            OpinionWorld, and any other panel(s) created, maintained, and/or
            operated by SSI and/or its affiliates, subsidiaries and/or
            divisions (collectively referred to herein as "<span>SSI</span>"),
            and to non-panel members participating in a survey(s) offered,
            provided, hosted, or administered by SSI. SSI strives to conform
            its privacy practices, policies and/or procedures with any and all
            applicable international, country specific, Federal, state and/or
            local laws, codes, regulations, and requirements (collectively
            "<span>Laws</span>"); and the industry codes, standards and
            regulations of various market and opinion research professional
            associations and/or organizations, including without limitation the
            ICC/ESOMAR International Code on Market and Social Research and the
            Code of Standards and Ethics for Survey Research of the Council of
            American Survey Research Organizations ("<span>CASRO</span>"), with
            whom SSI is a member (collectively the "<span>Codes</span>"). SSI
            is committed to protecting the security and integrity of all
            Personal Information (as defined herein) collected by, or disclosed
            to, SSI. SSI will not use any Personal Information for direct
            marketing or advertising purposes and membership as a panel member
            and/or participation in any survey(s) are completely voluntary.
            This Privacy Policy identifies the Personal Information that SSI
            collects; how such Personal Information will be used and protected;
            and your rights.

            <a name="2">2.</a> Types of Personal Information Collected
          </h2>
          <p>
            Individuals may join SSI’s growing databases of survey
            respondents by registering with any of SSI’s panels at each
            panel’s website. The term "<span>Personal Information</span>"
            includes, without limitation, an individuals’ first and last
            name, residential address, email address, telephone number, age,
            gender, and date of birth. SSI collects Personal Information about
            panel members during the registration process and collects
            demographic information, including, without limitation information
            regarding employment status, hobbies, interests and product
            ownership ("<span>Demographic Information</span>") after the
            registration process. SSI collects Personal Information and
            Demographic Information about non-panel members both before and
            during the non-panel member’s participation in a survey(s).
          </p>
          <p>
            In the United States, SSI collects and maintains social security
            numbers of panel members for tax purposes in connection with
            incentive fulfillment. Social security numbers are protected as
            Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and are
            collected, maintained, used, and disclosed in accordance with
            applicable Laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            SSI may collect the internet protocol address (the "<span>IP
            Address</span>") that is publicly available on your computer. The
            IP Address is not collected for the purpose of tracking or
            monitoring your activity on the Internet. In non-United States
            jurisdictions an IP Address may be classified as personal
            information or personal data under applicable Laws; therefore, to
            the extent that SSI collects IP Addresses, SSI will collect, use,
            maintain, secure and/or disclose IP Addresses in accordance with
            applicable Laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            Individuals may be recruited on behalf of SSI by SSI’s partners.
            The recruitment may occur through websites maintained by SSI’s
            partners. The Personal Information collected by SSI’s partners in
            connection with the recruitment process will be transferred to SSI
            only if the recruited individuals provide written consent to such
            transfer. SSI is neither responsible nor liable for the privacy and
            business practices and procedures of any of SSI’s partners.

            <a name="3">3.</a> Uses of Personal Information
          </h2>
          <p>
            Generally, SSI uses Personal Information for the purpose of
            contacting and communicating with individuals in connection with
            their panel membership and/or their participation in a survey(s),
            and SSI uses Personal Information and Demographic Information to
            tailor survey invitations to individuals. In addition to the
            permitted uses of Personal Information as set forth in Section 2,
            above, SSI collects email addresses to enable SSI to send email
            invitations to individuals for participation in upcoming surveys;
            and SSI requests Demographic Information including, without
            limitation, age, gender, date of birth, employment status, hobbies,
            interests and product ownership, to match individuals with
            appropriate surveys.

          <p>
            Generally, SSI will only share data and/or information with its
            clients in an aggregated form or format, which does not permit the
            client to identify individual respondents. SSI limits the use of
            Personal Information only for legitimate market research purposes
            and in accordance with applicable Laws and Codes.

            -In the event that an individual signs up for more than one panel
            or sub-panels owned and/or operated by SSI; in which case, the
            panels will disclose, transfer and share the data subjects’
            Personal Information among the various panels and/or sub-panels
            with whom the data subject has registered.
          </p>
          <p>
            -SSI may disclose or share Personal Information to authorized and
            approved agents, consultants, vendors and/or subcontractors of SSI
            and/or of SSI’s clients (individually a
            “<span>Subcontractor</span>” and collectively the
            “<span>Subcontractors</span>”) in connection with a
            Subcontractor’s performance of services for SSI and/or SSI’s
            clients. Prior to performing services, SSI requires Subcontractors
            to agree in writing to protect and maintain the security and

          </h2>
          <p>
            In general, digital fingerprinting technologies assign a unique
            identifier or “Machine-ID” to a user’s computer to identify
            and track the computer. SSI will not use digital fingerprinting
            technology (the “<span>Technology</span>”) to collect Personal
            Information, or track the online activities, of the user of a
            computer; and will not disrupt or interfere with the use or control
            of a computer or alter, modify or change the settings or
            functionality of a computer. SSI will use the Technology to assist
            SSI’s clients in ensuring the integrity of survey results. The
            Technology will analyze publicly available information and data
            obtained from the computer’s web browser and from other publicly
            available data points, including without limitation the technical
            settings of the computer, the characteristics of the computer, and
            the computer’s IP Address, to create a unique identifier assigned
            to the computer. The unique identifier will be an alpha-numeric id.
            After creating the unique identifier, SSI does not retain the
            information analyzed by the Technology to create the unique
            identifier. In furtherance of SSI’s efforts to assist its clients
            in protecting and ensuring the integrity of survey results, SSI (a)
            may link or associate your unique identifier to you and any of your
            Personal Information; (b) may share your unique identifier with
            SSI’s clients and with other sample or panel providers; and (c)
            may receive or obtain a unique identifier linked to you from a
            third party, including without limitation a sample or panel
            provider or a client of SSI. Any unique identifier(s) received or
            obtained by SSI and linked to a specific individual will be
            protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
