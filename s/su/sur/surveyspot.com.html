<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Survey Sampling International, LLC and its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies (collectively “SSI”) provide sampling solutions and technology for survey research, providing clients with access to consumer and business-to-business respondents via internet, telephone (both fixed/landline and wireless/mobile), postal and multi-mode methodologies. SSI serves a vast array of for-profit and not-for profit businesses, universities and governmental agencies and departments. This Privacy Policy sets forth the collection, use and disclosure of personal data or personally identifiable information (“PII”) and other information by SSI in connection with SSI’s Services (as defined herein). SSI’s Services provide you with the opportunity to join a Panel (as defined herein), participate in surveys (whether as a Panel member or a non-Panel member), use the websites associated with the Panels, and receive and redeem rewards and incentives, including, without limitation, sweepstakes entries, offered in connection with Panel membership and/or the completion of surveys (collectively “Services”). Registration with, use of, and access to SSI’s Services is subject to <span style="color: #0070c0;"><a href="http://opinionworld.com/en/policies/terms/general"><span style="color: #0070c0;">SSI’s Terms and Conditions</span></a></span>. &nbsp;Your use of SSI’s Services is completely voluntary and therefore SSI’s processing of your PII in connection with the Services and this Privacy Policy is with your consent. SSI strives to conform its privacy practices to applicable laws, codes, and regulations, and the codes of standards of applicable market and opinion survey research associations, including, without limitation, CASRO and ESOMAR. For clarification, except for Panels that have a separate privacy policy, this Privacy Policy applies to all of SSI’s survey research panels, including, without limitation, SurveySpot, Opinion Outpost, OpinionWorld, Choozz and YourVoice (each a “Panel” and collectively the “Panels”). All references in this Privacy Policy to SSI include SSI and its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies. All references to “us” or “we” refer to SSI.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">All PII is stored on servers located in the United States, which servers are owned and maintained by SSI. SSI complies with the United States (“US”) - European Union (“EU”) and US – Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from EU member countries and Switzerland. SSI has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.

In addition to the collection of PII mentioned above, during and subsequent to the registration process, you may be asked to voluntarily provide or disclose Sensitive Data. <strong>“Sensitive Data”</strong> means PII that discloses or reveals health and medical conditions, sexual orientation or sexual life, political opinions/views, race/ethnic origin, religious and philosophical beliefs and trade-union membership. Sensitive Data is used to target survey opportunities to you. By way of clarification, by voluntarily disclosing Sensitive Data to SSI you expressly consent to the transfer of Sensitive Data by SSI to the United States for storage and processing.</span></p>

<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Cookies are small files that store certain data on a device or computer. SSI may use session and persistent cookies for several purposes including, without limitation, to provide a better survey experience, quality control, validation, to enable or facilitate survey participation, tracking of completed surveys or other completed actions, and for fraud detection and/or prevention. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your device or computer indefinitely until deleted. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Use of Cookies by Subcontractors Generally.</span></em></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial;">SSI uses third parties to provide services and certain functionality to SSI, including, without limitation, fraud detection services. SSI uses contracts with such third parties to control their use of cookies and to limit their use of cookies to the limited purposes set forth in the contracts.</span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><em>SSI’s Online Ad Effectiveness Program.</em></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In connection with SSI’s online ad effectiveness program, you can participate in surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that SSI is testing for its clients. To facilitate the completion of these surveys, SSI’s clients may write, set, or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies and/or any other related technology (each a “<strong>Third Party Technology</strong>” and collectively the “<strong>Third Party Technologies</strong>”). The Third Party Technologies may be written, set or read in various locations, including, without limitation, SSI’s servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in or associated with the Third Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and SSI’s client will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, SSI’s client will send your UID and the specific survey to SSI and SSI will provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey. Additionally, if you participate, SSI may share your UID and data previously collected by SSI, including, without limitation, age, gender, income, number of people in your household, education/education level, and employment status, (“<strong>Audience Measurement Data</strong>”), to third parties, including, without limitation, SSI’s subcontractors, partners, and/or clients for the purpose of audience measurement reporting on the advertisements, campaigns, and websites that you visit, view, and/or click on. The Audience Measurement Data will be used to assist in the creation, development, and implementation of websites, online advertisements, and other Internet and digital media features, functionality, and campaigns. Audience Measurement Data may be shared in a single summary form (i.e. individual respondent level) or aggregate summary form (i.e. group of respondents).</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: arial;">Does SSI collect data from children?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: arial;"><br>
</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">SSI believes it is important to protect the online privacy of children. Accordingly, SSI adheres to Applicable Laws and Codes pertaining to the protection of children’s privacy, including, without limitation, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 in the United States (as amended). SSI carefully considers both privacy issues and parental concerns in connection with surveys involving individuals under the age of eighteen (18). Certain countries where SSI operates and maintains a Panel may prescribe an age threshold under which parental consent is required for the collection of PII. SSI’s Services are not designed or intended for use by any individual under such age thresholds. SSI does not knowingly collect PII from anyone under such age thresholds. If SSI became aware that it had inadvertently collected PII from anyone under such age thresholds, SSI would promptly delete such PII. For example, in the United States, SSI’s Services are not designed or intended for use by any individual under the age of thirteen (13) and SSI does not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of thirteen (13).</span><span style="font-family: arial;">Parents, guardians or other persons with parental rights are encouraged to contact SSI, as set forth below, to discuss this Privacy Policy and their rights to access, review, correct, delete or object to the processing of PII of or about their child or children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: arial;">What security is available for the PII and other information collected through the Services?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: arial;"><br>
</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">SSI maintains appropriate technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect PII and other information disclosed or collected by SSI. SSI reviews, monitors and evaluates its privacy practices and protection systems on a regular basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, transmissions over the Internet and/or a mobile network are not one hundred percent (100%) secure and SSI does not guarantee the security of transmissions. SSI is not responsible for any errors by individuals in submitting PII to SSI.</span></p>
