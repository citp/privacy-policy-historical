<p><b>Privacy Statement</b></p>

<p><b>Your privacy is important</b>
</p>
<p><b>Survey Sampling International SurveySpot Privacy Policy</b><br>
Survey Sampling International, LLC (SSI) respects the privacy of every SurveySpot panel member. This Privacy Policy outlines the information SSI will collect and how we will use that information. This Statement will also tell you how you can verify the accuracy of your Personal Information (defined below) submitted to SSI and how you can request that we delete or update your Personal Information. 
</p><p>
We've developed this privacy statement from industry guidelines and standards, and local, national, and international laws and requirements. All privacy practices and methods described in this statement apply only insofar as permitted by the applicable standards, laws and requirements. The SurveySpot research panel was created by SSI, partners with researchers since 1977. SSI is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. SSI routinely reviews its privacy and security practices and continually enhances them to protect your privacy. 
</p><p>
<b>The information we gather </b><br>
Individuals can join our growing database of survey respondents by registering at our SurveySpot.com website. During the registration process, we gather personal information (name, address, age, etc.). After registration, we ask panel members to provide us with additional information (such as details of hobbies, interests and product ownership). We do this so we can send panel members surveys that best correspond with their interests. 
</p><p>
Members may also be recruited on our behalf by third party websites, who may forward personal information to us, all with the member's prior consent. 
</p>
<p><b>How we use your information</b><br>
We use your e-mail address to send you invitations to participate in surveys and to contact you with messages regarding panel information. We use your postal address to mail any survey-related rewards, prizes and incentives or to assign you to demographic and geographic groups as required by research projects. 
</p><p>
SSI supports the rights of our members by limiting the use of their information for legitimate marketing research purposes and is active in supporting the following organizations created to uphold ethical survey research. (This support includes making every effort to conform to the organizations' ethical standards.): 
</p><ul>
		<li>Marketing Research Association (<a href="http://www.mra-net.org/" class="body">MRA</a>). </li>
		<li>	American Marketing Association (<a href="http://www.ama.org/" class="body">AMA</a>). </li>
		<li>	American Association for Public Opinion Research (<a href="http://www.aapor.org/" class="body">AAPOR</a>). </li>
		<li>	Council of American Survey Research Organizations (<a href="http://www.casro.org/" class="body">CASRO</a>). </li>
		<li>	Advertising Research Foundation (<a href="http://www.thearf.org/" class="body">ARF</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p></p><p>
SSI also strives to conform to FTC Safe Harbor regulations regarding data protection in the European Union; the FTCs Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the CAN-SPAM Act, and other privacy regulations and guidelines in the US and other countries. 
</p>
<p>
Your information is used solely for research purposes. We will never try to sell you anything; we are only interested in your opinions. When you complete a survey, your responses are analyzed in aggregate with all other respondents' information and reported not individually, but only in the aggregate. Our research clients will never receive personally identifiable information about our panel members, nor will they be able to identify panel members, without your express permission. 
</p>
<p>We will never share your e-mail address or personally identifiable information with anyone except an approved agent or sub-contractor we may engage for activities like reward fulfillment and data verification. All agents or sub-contractors must sign a confidentiality or "chain of trust" agreement. 
</p>
<p>
We may disclose your personal information to a third party when required to do so by law, or to protect someone's safety, or our rights or property. 
</p>
<p>
As a panel member, you may be shown confidential information as part of the surveys you take. In order to protect the integrity and confidentiality of our clients' research, it is a condition of membership that you agree not to reveal any information contained in surveys, and do not copy or distribute any graphics or other content from the surveys. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Updating your information</b><br>
We encourage you to update your panelist information. To help you do this, we set up member accounts for all members. These can only be accessed via a password which you establish. You can update your information in the following ways: 
</p><ul>
<li>Send an e-mail request to <a class="body" href="/svy/survey/ContactMemberServices.jsp">our members' services team</a></li>
<li>Visit <a class="body" href="/panelist/PanelistManager">your member account</a> on our web site, and follow the instructions</li>
<li> Phone at 1.203.255.4200, please ask for Susan Evans </li>
<li> Postal mail to Attn: Susan Evans, Survey Sampling International, One Post Road, Fairfield, CT 06824 USA</li>

</ul>

<p>
<b>Children's privacy protection</b><br>
SSI believes that it's especially important to protect children's privacy online and encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to participate and monitor their Internet activity. 
</p>
<p>
SSI complies with all applicable national and international children's privacy regulations. 
</p>
<p>
We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. We do not permit children who are under 18 years of age to become SSI panel members. We do not collect any personal information from children under 18 years of age. As part of the registration process for new panel members, we may collect from the new panel member the names of each individual in the panel members' household, which may include the names of children who are under 18 years of age. Occasionally we may send a survey to a panel member who is a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 18 that asks that panel member to have his or her child who is under 18 answer the survey. We take reasonable steps to ensure parental consent to such procedure by sending the survey to the parent or guardian's password-protected e-mail address. The information collected in response to such surveys is not combined with identifying information about the child. In every case such survey does not collect personally identifiable information about the child. 
</p>
<p>
If a panel member has provided us with personal information about a child in the panel member's household who is under the age of 18, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us at the email address or mailing address listed at the bottom of this Privacy Policy if he or she would like this information deleted from our records. We will take all commercially reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our databases. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Links</b><br>
When taking a survey, you may have the opportunity to link to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of those sites. We recommend that you carefully read the privacy policies of each site you visit. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
Like many other websites, we use cookies to provide a better experience for our members. We limit their use for quality control and validation. Cookies are used temporarily during the time you are actively completing a survey or filling out the registration forms and we do not store or retain your cookie information in any way. You always have the option to disable cookies while registering or completing a survey without affecting your participation. No personally identifiable information is transmitted via these cookies. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, we may invite you to take part in surveys where a third-party client requires placement of cookies in order to take part in a particular survey opportunity. Such cookies will never be placed without your knowledge and without explaining to you their purpose. You will always have a choice to decline the placement of such a cookie. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Data Security</b><br>
SSI takes the security of your information seriously. Access to your personal information is restricted and limited to select SSI staff members, and access is subject to a strict password policy. SSI employees receive training in data privacy and protection. 
</p>
<p>
We will never ask you for information such as credit card or social security numbers, although we are required by law to request your social security number when sending you a check for very large cash prizes. 
</p>
<p>
SSI has security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. 
</p>
<p>
All website members are required to use their e-mail address and a password when updating their contact information, or when accessing "members only" sections of our websites. If you forget your password, you can send a message to our secure system to retrieve it. We take all commercially reasonable efforts to deploy technology and internal processes to protect the information our members release to us. 
</p>
<p>
All surveys are screened by SSI staff before sending you an invitation to ensure they are proper and appropriate for their intended audiences. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Opting-out of our panels</b><br>
If you choose to end your membership in our panels, you may automatically resign by clicking on <a class="body" href="/svy/71">this link</a>. Your panelist membership record will be deactivated and you will no longer receive invitations from us, although you may continue to receive some previously prepared invitations for a few days. We apologize for any such inconvenience. Our current privacy protection terms will continue to protect your data even after your resignation. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Transfer of information</b><br>
SSI reserves the right to transfer personally identifiable information to a buyer in connection with a sale of stock or assets, merger, or any other change of control transaction. Any acquirer would be required to honor our privacy policy. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Contacting us</b><br>
