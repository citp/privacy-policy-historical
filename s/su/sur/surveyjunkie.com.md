When you participate in research, you may be asked for your personal opinions, as well as demographic information, such as your age and household composition.

Occasionally, we may contact you also to notify you if you have won a prize draw that we sponsored and/or to ask for your permission to use your personal information for a purpose that was not explained to you when we first collected your personal information. 

Like most web sites, we gather certain non-personal information automatically and store it in various databases, cookies, or log files. This information includes IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, to prevent creating duplicate accounts, to administer our site, to track users' movements around our site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. To protect against fraud, we may link this automatically-collected data to information submitted.

SURVEY JUNKIE makes reasonable efforts to keep personal information in its possession or control, which is used on an ongoing basis, accurate, complete, current and relevant, based on the most recent information available to us. We rely on you to help us keep your personal information accurate, complete and current by answering our questions honestly.
