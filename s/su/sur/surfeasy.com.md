## SurfEasy

## Product/Service Description

SurfEasy provides private and security data transmission by routing browser Internet traffic through the SurfEasy network, which may mean your Internet traffic is routed through one or more countries. The software browser or client establishes and maintains an encrypted tunnel between the browser or device and the SurfEasy network. SurfEasy is a No Log network, which means that SurfEasy does not store originating IP address when connected to the SurfEasy service, and therefore SurfEasy cannot identify users when provided IP addresses of the servers. Because this information is not stored, this also means SurfEasy cannot disclose information about the applications, services or websites visited or used while connected to SurfEasy.

## Data Access and Collection

  1. Aggregate bandwidth usage
  2. Temporary usage data
  3. Internet and data traffic, such as destination website or IP address and originating IP address
  4. In-app telemetry data



## Data Processing

  1. Bandwidth usage is required for billing, network operations and support.
  2. Usage data provides assistance with debugging service problems and is not retained once resolved.
  3. Destination website and IP address data is processed to perform automated rules-based traffic management to maintain and improve the service. This is a real-time process, and no log data is maintained.
  4. Analytics technology, such as Google Analytics, is used to improve the service, design, and app experience.
