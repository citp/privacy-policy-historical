			      Warning!<br>
			      Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which  are mentioned below. No representation is being made that any account will or  is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there  are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and  actual results subsequently achieved by any<br>
			      particular trading program.<br>
  <br>
			      One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are  generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical  trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can  completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading.<br>
  <br>
			      For example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular  trading program in spite of the trading losses are material points, which can  also adversely affect trading results. There are numerous other factors related  to the market in general or to the implementation of any specific trading  program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of<br>
			      hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual  trading results.</p>
			    <p>&nbsp;</p>
			    <p></p>
			    <div class="body_get_caution">
                  <h1 style="text-align:center; padding-bottom:5px;"><br>
                    Caution</h1>
			      HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM.<br>
                  <br>
			      ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS.<br>
