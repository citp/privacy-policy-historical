iPoll Privacy Policy  
Last updated: May 20, 2015

iPoll is committed to safeguarding your privacy. iPoll is a branded online site and mobile app owned and operated by Instantly, Inc. headquartered at 16501 Ventura Blvd., Suite 300, Encino, California, 91436.

Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our website, mobile app and services. By using this website and/or mobile app and registering for our service you agree that your personal information will be shared with Instantly, Inc. in the U.S. where a lower level of privacy protection may apply than in your own country.

What personally identifiable information does iPoll collect from me?

iPoll collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of websites or through our mobile app. Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, iPoll asks for your name, email address, zip code, household information and personal interests. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register, you are no longer anonymous to iPoll and you can access various protected areas of the site.

For a more detailed discussion about the collection of data through cookies, please see the section immediately below. Depending on the nature of the market research or behavioral measurement services with its clients, and subject to an appropriate third party confidentiality agreement, a unique identification number ("UID") will be assigned to you. This UID may then be shared with clients and other third parties for research and other purposes in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. 

What are cookies and how does iPoll use them?

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, iPoll may use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. Some areas on iPoll where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable may require that you accept cookies. This avoids you having to enter your login information many times in one day. Currently, cookies are utilized by iPoll within the following four primary categories or uses: (1) business cookies which operate as a quality control and verification mechanism in connection with the survey process; (2) performance cookies so that traffic patterns and uses on the iPoll website may be measured and optimized; (3) user cookies so that user information may be recorded so as to enhance performance and user experience on the website; and (4) targeting cookies which are utilized to measure webviewing for market research purposes. 

In what ways do third parties use cookies and other technologies?

From time to time, iPoll collaborates with third parties (including clients) to enable the use of targeting cookies, web beacons, pixels, SDK's, and mobile device identifiers to measure web-viewing and mobile use activities, for behavioral measurement purposes, in connection with ad exposure and display advertising for market research purposes and other related activities. To facilitate these services, iPoll's clients (or their agents) may write, set or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies and other related technologies ("Third Party Technologies"). If you participate, your UID will be stored in, or associated with, Third Party Technologies to allow you to be re-contacted about online ads, promotions or in connection with market research surveys. iPoll's clients (or their agents) will use the Third Party Technologies to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. iPoll will share your UID with iPoll clients (or their agents) so that you will have an opportunity to complete a survey or so that data previously collected by iPoll, such as age, gender, income, etc. ("Audience Measurement Data") may be shared with third parties, including without limitation, iPoll's subcontractors, partners, and/or clients for the purpose of audience measurement reporting on the advertising, campaigns, and websites that you visit, view, and/or click on. The Audience Measurement Data will be used to assist in the creation, development, and implementation of websites, online advertisements, and other Internet and digital media features, functionality, and campaigns.

Can I receive surveys on my mobile devices?

In addition to websites, some iPoll surveys and solutions are offered via mobile devices. You will participate in such surveys only to the extent you expressly agree to participate through this platform. You acknowledge and agree that in such circumstances, mobile tracking functions will be enabled which track your mobile device via position locaters such as Global Positioning System ("GPS") and identifiers associated with your mobile device, such as an advertising ID, for the purpose of providing you with customized and timely surveys or related services and initiatives which are tailored to query and/or measure your specific preferences and/or opinions and to provide the most meaningful and timely information to iPoll's clients and partners. Some of these specific services and initiatives include, but are not limited to, the serving up of targeted ads for research, behavioral measurement, and related purposes.

Depending on the operating system of your mobile device, you may have the ability to disable or reset the identifier on your device that is associated with advertisements (e.g., IDFA for iOS and Advertising IDs for Android). For more information, you are urged to review the functionalities and features of the operating system specific to your mobile device and to consult the privacy policies of such third party operating systems.

When you are participating in iPoll surveys and solutions via mobile devices and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with iPoll or with any other third party with whom you elect to share such information. If personally identifiable information is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than iPoll, the use of such personal information will be governed by appropriate confidentiality and security agreements between iPoll and such third parties.

With your express consent only, through your mobile device, iPoll also offers opportunities for you to participate in market research that measures behavior and other qualities using technologies such as Audio Content Recognition ("ACR"), facial expression analyses, among other methods.

As part of its offerings and services, iPoll provides you with customized and timely surveys or related services and initiatives which are tailored to query and/or measure your specific preferences and/or opinions and to provide the most meaningful and timely information to iPoll's clients and partners. Some of these specific services and initiatives include, but are not limited to, the serving up of targeted ads for research and behavioral measurement purposes.

Certain types of sensitive information that may be collected, for example, personal information specifying racial or ethnic origin will be treated with additional care. 

iPoll may automatically gather and store certain information in log files, including without limitation, data available from your web browser, such as IP address, browser type, internet service provider, operating system, date/time stamp and click stream data. iPoll also utilizes, either directly or through a third party vendor, "digital fingerprinting" and "watermarking" features. iPoll uses these features for quality control and validation purposes and fraud detection and/or prevention, including without limitation, the identification of duplicate or fraudulent respondents. "Digital fingerprinting" refers to those circumstances in which a unique identifier is assigned to your device or computer based on the device's or computer's settings, including technical settings, characteristics, and IP address. Generally, watermarking involves placing a technology or file on your device or computer to identify that it has previously been used to register or access iPoll.

The information practices of those websites or apps linked to, or made available through, iPoll are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

With whom does iPoll share my information?

Other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, iPoll will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. Please see the Terms & Conditions or User Agreements for each of our products and services for more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed.

Business Partners & Sponsors: Subject to the other applicable provisions herein, iPoll may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors. Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors.

Other: iPoll may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating iPoll Terms & Conditions or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) iPoll rights or property, other iPoll users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. iPoll may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.

Finally, if there is a sale of a majority of the shares or assets of the legal entities owning and operating iPoll, you agree that your personal information and data may be transferred or assigned to such new owners.

Some jurisdictions deem Imagery of individuals as constituting personally identifiable information and iPoll treats it as such.

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Instantly, Inc., its branches, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents from any claims arising out of, or relating to, your unauthorized use of the Imagery or for any claims that the Imagery violates a third party intellectual property right or a right of publicity or privacy. 

What other requirements or obligations are placed on me?

The time you spend to participate in surveys and other offerings on our websites and other platforms (including mobile) provides valuable feedback to our clients which helps result in better products and services in the marketplace. In return for your participation, you earn points towards various awards and also have opportunities for other offerings and prizes. You are solely responsible for the use, purchase and maintenance of your own electronic devices (be they handheld devices, laptops, etc.) and all of the corresponding internet connection, landline, wireless carrier, or other charges that you may incur regarding the use of such devices. You also agree that you will not participate in surveys while operating a moving vehicle, or in any other unsafe situation.

What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?

Your iPoll Account Information and iPoll Profile are password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information.

We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. iPoll will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your iPoll account and close your browser window when you have finished your work.

Whenever iPoll handles personal information as described above, regardless of where this occurs, iPoll takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the iPoll website Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

Finally, in the event there are material changes to this policy in the future, iPoll will make appropriate announcements and disclosures on this website.
