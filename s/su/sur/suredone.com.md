### Information Collection and Use

**Account Registration:** When you create or reconfigure a SureDone account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, password, physical address, phone number, business name, and email address. Your business name is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results provided through certain third-party websites. Some Services do not require registration.

**Additional Information:** As part of the registration and account creation process, you may be asked to provide other personally identifying information. Providing some of the requested information is optional and SureDone will indicate what information is required and what information is optional.  You can always choose not to provide information even though it may be needed to make a purchase from a SureDone client or take advantage of our Services or features. 

You may provide us with profile information to make public, such as information about your business, your location, your website, or pictures. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe by following the instructions contained within the notification. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your SureDone account to your account on another service in order to cross-post between SureDone and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. 

**Public Information:** The Services are designed to help SureDone’s clients share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us as a SureDone client is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the the products that you post for sale, and media you store on the Services, as well as many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. Our Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public product listings are immediately delivered via our APIs to our partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate SureDone content into their services.

**Location Information:** You may choose to publish your location in your SureDone profile. You may also tell us your location when you send shipping information or billing information to  SureDone, or your computer or mobile device sends us location information. We may also use other data from your device to determine location, for example, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as determining product availability with your location, and to improve and customize the Services. 

**Links:** SureDone may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.

**Cookies:** Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. SureDone may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. 

**Log Data:** When you use our Services, we may receive information (" **Log Data** ") such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, or interact with our email notifications. We may also receive Log Data when you click on, view or interact with a link to our Services through a third-party application, such as when you choose to purchase an item from a SureDone client through a third-party integration partner, such as eBay or Amazon. SureDone uses Log Data to provide, understand, and improve our Services. 

**Commerce Services:** You may provide your payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address (collectively, " **Payment Information** "), along with your shipping address, to complete a commerce transaction on  SureDone or with a SureDone client. To facilitate future purchases on SureDone, we store your Payment Information in Stripe, which you can remove from your account at any time by sending an email to support@suredone.com. We consider your Payment Information and do not make such information public. We collect and store information created by your purchases made from a SureDone Client (" **Transaction Data** "). Transaction Data may include the SureDone client’s name and the date, time and amount of the transaction, as well as your shipping and billing information. In addition, SureDone may also collect information about your bidding, buying and selling history as well as third party comments regarding your bidding, buying and selling behavior. Bidding and buying history may specifically include your history with respect to any failure to complete sales on winning bids.  

**Third-Parties and Affiliates:** SureDone uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address.
