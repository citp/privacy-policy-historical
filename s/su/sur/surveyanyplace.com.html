          <p>This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) tells you how we use personal information collected at the surveyanyplace.com Site. Please read this Privacy Policy before using the Site or submitting any Personal Data. By using the Site, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy supplements the Survey Anyplace Terms (and uses terms defined therein), and is a part of the Agreement between Survey Anyplace and its Users.</p>
<h3>Principles applied</h3>
<p>Survey Anyplace is committed to the protection of the privacy and Personal Data of its Users.</p>
<p>Survey Anyplace applies the principles of Data Protection Law (which is defined as the applicable laws governing data protection and privacy. Throughout the European Union, this means the relevant implementations of the EU Directive 95/46/EC dated 24 October 1995 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (Official Journal L 281 of 23/11/1995), any replacement legislation, or any similar regulation under any applicable law, and any regulatory requirements or codes of practice governing the use, storage or transmission of Personal Data), which are that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personal Data will only be processed fairly and lawfully;</li>
<li>Personal Data will only be processed for the purposes set forth in this Policy, and in accordance with your rights;</li>
<li>Personal Data collected will be adequate, relevant and not excessive in the light of these purposes;</li>
<li>Personal Data will not be kept longer than necessary;</li>
<li>Personal Data will be held secure;</li>
<li>Personal Data will only be transferred in accordance with applicable Data Protection Laws;</li>
<li>You will be able to ensure at all times that your Personal Data are accurate.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Which data are collected, and what are Personal Data?</h3>
<p>Survey Anyplace collects the Personal Data you submit when you open or use an Account. Examples are your name, address, or other data that allow you to be identified (“Personal Data”).</p>
<p>Please note that any data used or submitted by you in or through a survey or other application or functionality of the Site that is made partially or wholly available to other Users, Respondents or any part of the public is not considered Personal Data, since you choose to make it available to Respondents without interference from or control by Survey Anyplace.</p>
<h3>Use of Personal Data</h3>
<p>You agree that by submitting your Personal Data to the Site, Survey Anyplace may use and/or share with third parties your Personal Data for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>For managing your User account, including sending a password when reported forgotten, linking your name to Content you created, providing the Services offered, sending subscription-based emails, to which you can unsubscribe, regarding your account, the Site or the Services, and for collecting payments.</li>
<li>To deliver, monitor, develop and improve the Site and the Services and to provide you with a better and more personalized User experience.</li>
<li>For general advertising and marketing purposes (including audit, data analysis and research). Survey Anyplace may share demographic, profile and other general information about You and other Users with our partners on an aggregate basis.</li>
<li>For direct marketing purposes to You, but only when You have given permission</li>
<li>If required to do so by law, regulation or under a good faith belief that action is necessary to conform to or comply with the law and legal process, to protect and defend Survey Anyplace rights and/or property and customers, whether or not required to do so by law. Survey Anyplace reserves the right to contact appropriate authorities and disclose Personal Data at its discretion when it appears that individuals are using the Site or Services for illegal or infringing activities that otherwise violate the Survey Anyplace Privacy Policy or Terms.</li>
<li>To process Personal Data on servers in other countries. We may therefore transfer and process your Personal Data on a server outside Your country or outside the European Union or the European Economic Area. However, Survey Anyplace will always do so in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.</li>
<li>In relation to a merger or acquisition by another company, or if the business unit providing Your service were sold to another company, Personal Data may be transferred to and used by the resulting combined company. If Survey Anyplace were to cease operations, this Personal Data might be transferred to and used by another company, which offers similar or related products or services.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Subject to the above, we won’t do any of the following with your Personal Data:</p>
<ul><li>We won’t ever sell your Personal Data information to anyone else.</li>
<li>We won’t spam you (but we may send you useful updates and news from Survey Anyplace).</li>
<li>We won’t divulge your Personal Data to anyone you haven’t asked us explicitly to reveal it to.</li>
<li>We won’t share your information with a 3rd party unless required by law.</li>
          </ul>
<p>We do not sell personal information collected through this site or use your personal information for any other purposes than those stated above.</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy only covers the Survey Anyplace Site. We are not responsible for the data policies or procedures or the content of other linked sites.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies may be used by us to provide you with customised information from the Site. A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. Cookies allow us to understand who has seen which pages and advertisements, to determine how frequently particular pages are visited and to establish the most popular areas of our web site. Cookies are also used to maintain a session, which tells us you are logged in. Your password, or any other personal information, is never stored in this cookie. We use cookies so that we can give you a better experience when you return to our Site. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. You do not have to accept cookies, and you should read the information that came with your browser software to see how you can set up your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, this will give you the opportunity to decide whether to accept it. If you disable cookies from your browser you may not be able to access certain features of a particular web site.</p>
<h3>Keeping your Personal Data correct and complete</h3>
<p>While your account is active, you will at all times have access to your profile and any Personal Data you have submitted. You will be responsible for the content of your submitted Personal Data, and you will be responsible for such information to keep it truthful, correct and up to date. Please remember that Personal Data you share with other Users or Respondents may become public.</p>
<h3>Data Security</h3>
<p>Your Personal Data is kept secure. Only authorized employees, agents and contractors (who have agreed to keep information secure and confidential) have access to it.</p>
<p>Survey Anyplace uses a variety of adequate security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Survey Anyplace secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When financial information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to the payment gateway, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, its implementation, or your Personal Data, please contact Survey Anyplace at <a href="mailto:info@surveyanyplace.com">info@surveyanyplace.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Law</h3>
<p>The Website is operated from Belgium, and therefore Belgian law applies (including its implementation of Data Protection Laws). Only Belgian courts will have jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Modification</h3>
<p>Survey Anyplace reserves the right to make changes to and update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by posting the new version of the Privacy Policy on the Site or may send each User a courtesy email.&nbsp; It is your responsibility to check the Site for updates to this Privacy Policy.</p>
