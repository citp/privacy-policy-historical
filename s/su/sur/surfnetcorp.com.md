It is important to note that customer domain name registration information is made publicly available in the registry of domain names. Disclosure of customer information and communications **Surf _Net_** will not otherwise disclose its customers' personal and account information unless **Surf _Net_** has reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of **Surf _Net_** , **Surf _Net's_** customers, or others, or where **Surf _Net_** has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure.
