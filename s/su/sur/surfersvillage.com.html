        Policy</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><strong>Our commitment to you</strong></font> </p>
      <p>Surfersvillage is concerned about the protection of online privacy for 
        all our website visitors. Although we track the total number of visitors 
        to each of our sites in an aggregate form to allow us to update and improve 
        our sites, personally identifiable information is not extracted in this 
        process. Any cookie technology (where our servers deposit special codes 
        on a visitor's computer) will only be used to track non-personal information 
        such as type of browser, operating system, and domain names to improve 
        our visitors' online experience.</p>
      <p>There is much confusion about cookies, how they are used, and what they 
        can do. Cookies are very small text files written by an Internet server 
        to a customer's browser when information is exchanged. Cookies only contain 
        information that the server computer "knew" in the first place and can 
        only be read by the serving domain that placed them. Cookies are an essential 
        part of how the Internet works today and allow server computers to recognize 
        your computer's browser when you return.</p>
      <p>If you have ever gone to a web page that automatically provides personalized 
        content to you without you having to "log in," such as your own stock 
        portfolio, this is almost certainly being accomplished with a cookie. 
        As cookies are only text files, they cannot "run" on your computer and 
        have no ability to search your computer for other information or transmit 
        it to anyone.</p>
      <p>Cookies are implemented as part of the technology implemented by your 
        web browser.</p>

      <p>Surfersvillage only collects personally identifiable data, such as names, 
        addresses, email addresses, and the like, when voluntarily submitted by 
        a visitor. In addition, we advise minors to get parental permission before 
        filling out any online forms.</p>
      <p>Surfersvillage does not sell or release any information gathered on our 
        websites to any third parties unless given permission to do so. All information 
        gathered online will be used only by Surfersvillage for internal marketing 
        analysis and to improve our products, services and websites.</p>
      <p>In some instances, when an email address has been provided by the visitor, 
        and the visitor is 18 or older and has indicated that he/she would like 
        to receive communications from us, we will send notices to visitors, usually 
        in the form of an email.</p>
      <p>These notices, sent periodically, will announce website upgrades, new 
        product information and other similar updates.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to change this policy at any time by notifying guests 
        of the existence of a new privacy policy.</p>
