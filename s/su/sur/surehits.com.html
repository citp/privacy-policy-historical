				<h2>SureHits Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>Internet consumer privacy is of paramount importance to SureHits and our 
					advertisers. The following statement outlines our policies and principles 
					regarding online privacy. SureHits is committed to protecting the privacy of 
					consumers and to do our part to maintain the integrity and security of the 
					Internet. Because of the changing nature of consumer needs and our business 
					itself, SureHits reserves the right to modify this policy statement at any time 
					without notice. As such, and since we want to always make certain that our 
					privacy policy is clearly understood, we recommend that you review this Privacy 
					Statement periodically to note any changes that may have occurred. Please 
					forward any comments you may have regarding this policy to us at <a href="mailto:service@SureHits.com">
						service@SureHits.com</a>.</p>

						<strong>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</strong></legend>
					<p>When an Internet consumer clicks on one of Cyberspace Communication Corp.'s 
						placed advertisements, Cyberspace Communication Corp. does not collect any 
						personally identifiable information regarding the consumer who clicked on the 
						ad (e.g. name, address, social security number, e-mail address).</p>
						
					<p>
					    In the course of providing the user a shopping experience, personally identifiable information may be provided to Cyberspace Communications Corp. This information will be temporarily stored for a reasonable length of time for the purposes of fulfilling the shopping experience. The personally identifiable information supplied by the user will not be permanently stored or archived.
					</p>
				</fieldset>
				<fieldset>
					<legend>
						<strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII)</strong></legend>
					<p>
						When an Internet consumer clicks on one of Cyberspace Communication Corp.'s 
						placed advertisements, Cyberspace Communication Corp. collects what the 
						industry terms as "ad delivery and reporting data" (Type of Browser, Operating 
						System, IP address, domain type, page(s) visited, date and time of when an 
						Internet consumer has responded to an advertisement). This type of information 
						is defined by the Network Advertising Initiative (see Network Advertising 
						Initiative section below) as Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII) 
						"ad delivery and reporting data". This means that none of the data can be 
						linked to any individual Internet consumer, and therefore it cannot be used for 
						profiling purposes.
						<br>
						<br>
						Cyberspace Communication Corp. retains all ad delivery and reporting data 
						indefinitely, for accounting and auditing purposes.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition Cyberspace Communication Corp. does not collect any specific 
						non-personally identifiable information (e.g. age, gender, interests, 
						income-range) that could potentially be linked with other data to identify 
						individual Internet consumers for the purpose of profiling.
					</p>
				</fieldset>
				<fieldset>
					<legend>
						<strong>Cookies</strong></legend>
					<p>
						When an Internet consumer views a Cyberspace Communication Corp. served 
						advertisement for the first time, a cookie is placed within their computer. A 
						cookie is a unique tag that is issued to the Internet customer and is used to 
						identify individual computers. The purpose of the cookie is to allow the ad 
						placement company to deliver advertisements that have a greater degree of 
						relevance to the consumer, even though that consumer is, in essence, anonymous 
						to the ad placement company. Consumers who wish to remove this cookie and 
						disable their web browser from receiving further cookies can do so by following 
						the instructions provided by their browser's manufacturer.
					</p>
				</fieldset>
				<fieldset>
					<legend>
						<strong>Ad management and Reporting Data - Use of Cookies</strong></legend>
					<p>
						When a consumer clicks on an ad placed by Cyberspace Communication Corp., they 
						are assigned a unique number, known as a cookie, which is recorded and stored 
						on their computer in their web browser's cookie file. Cookies do not harm 
						Internet consumer's computers.
						<br>
						<br>
						Cookies help us to reach several of our key goals, such as providing Internet 
						users with a more fulfilling, results oriented experience on the web, and 
						increasing the amount of relevant material viewed by Internet consumers.

						<strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Client Data</strong></legend>
					<p>
						Cyberspace Communication Corp. sometimes collects non-personally identifiable 
						information from our clients. Non-personally identifiable information is also

						geographic location. We use this information to refer consumers to appropriate 
						partners.

						Communication Corp. will never request or collect data from a client on subject 
						areas including sexual orientation, political or religious affiliations, or 
						medical data.
						<br><br>
						Cyberspace Communication Corp. does not use any personally identifiable data 
						about a client for profiling purposes. All personally identifiable information 
						that Cyberspace Communication Corp. collects from clients is principally 
						intended for administrative needs (e.g., accounting), for which purpose such 
						data are required.
						<br><br>
						All personally identifiable data provided by individual clients will be kept in 
						strict confidence by Cyberspace Communication Corp. and will be treated with 
						the same level of respect and care that Cyberspace Communication Corp. treats

						Corp. will never sell, rent, exchange or barter any personally identifiable 
						information to or with any third party for financial gain or marketing 
						purposes.

						As of April 21, 2000 the children's Online Privacy Protection Act became 
						effective. The regulations apply to the online collection of personal

						is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and makes every effort to 
						protect the privacy of children using the Internet. Cyberspace Communication 
						Corp.'s web site, products, and services are not developed for or directed at 
						children. Our policy is not to permit anyone under the age of 13 to do business 
						with us. If you believe your child has provided Cyberspace Communication Corp. 
						with any personally identifiable data by registering at Cyberspace 
						Communication Corp.'s web site, please contact <a href="mailto:service@SureHits.com">
						service@SureHits.com</a> to have them removed.
