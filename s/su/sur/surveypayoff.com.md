Upon registration with the Website, you will be presented the opportunity to request and receive special offers provided by other companies.  You can choose some offers, all of them, or none of them - it's up to you. By choosing an offer and clicking the Submit/Continue button on the bottom of the offer page, you authorize us to pass along your email address and the information you provide to us on the sign-up form to the advertisers you select.  The privacy policies of these advertisers will be available for you to review before you select the offer.

  _Information Sharing_

We share the personal information that you provide on the Website with other parties on an “as needed” limited basis.  For example, we will pass along your contact information to an advertiser if you request to receive an offer from that advertiser.  You are not required to sign up for such offers to use the Website.  In other words, we do not share your information with third parties for direct marketing purposes without your consent.  In addition, we may employ service providers who may require your information to carry out their services in connection with the Website.

We use the anonymous aggregate information collected about your visit to the Website to improve our services.  We may share this information with third parties to help us in that determination.
