# Privacy

Surveybag is serious about your privacy. This privacy policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use our websites. Please read this notice carefully and understand how Surveybag is working hard to protect your personal information.

**Website Visitors**  
Like most website operators, Surveybag collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Surveybag’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Surveybag’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Surveybag may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. Please do not leave your personal information on comments even if it is connected to your facebook account and can be deleted.

Surveybag also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol addresses. Surveybag does not use such information to identify its visitors, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**  
Certain visitors to Surveybag’s websites choose to interact with Surveybag in ways that require Surveybag to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Surveybag gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for Surveybag.com to provide a username and email address. In each case, Surveybag collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Surveybag. Surveybag does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
