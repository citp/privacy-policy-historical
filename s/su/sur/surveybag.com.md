After getting a receipt with a survey invitation or a survey invitation card, you have a chance to take an online survey to give your feedback based on your shopping experience. Here are some useful tips for you to complete a survey and win big prizes.

**1\. Take care of your store receipt.**

Many store surveys require receipt information, so you need to keep it safe after shopping or dining. The details about your purchase are presented on the receipt, such as the date and time of your visit, store number, survey code and so forth. The information is very important if you decide to take this survey. In addition, a coupon or validation code is sometimes offered as a thank-you gift for your feedback at the end of a survey. And you need to write it down on your receipt for the offer on your next visit.

**2\. Check the survey URL.**

Prior to inputting the survey URL printed on your receipt into the required field of a browser or a search engine, please check it carefully as it sometimes may be long and complex. An incorrect survey URL will not bring you to the survey page.

**3\. Give honest feedback.**

Companies roll out surveys to collect you customers’ feedback so that they can provide better products and services. Your candid evaluation will help them do better. Read questions carefully and answer the questions based on your own experience to give useful suggestions.

**4\. Read sweepstakes terms and rules.**

Usually, as an encouragement for you to express opinions, you can be entered into a sweepstakes at the end of a survey. You are highly suggested to read the sweepstakes rules carefully to make sure you are doing the right thing. The rules will show you eligibility requirements, survey expiration date, guidance about how to get a prize and more. In short, many details in the Terms and Rules deserve your attention. One thing to note is that the link to the rules is not in an obvious position and you always can find it in the bottom of the survey page.

**5\. Provide correct contact information.**

Some surveys require you to offer your personal information such as your full name, email address, phone number, etc. The contact details will be used to notify you once you have won the sweepstakes prize. Your information will be kept confidentially. If you still have concerns, please read the privacy policy before taking each survey.

**6\. Keep contacted with stores.**

Some surveys will ask you whether you would like to be contacted to receive the latest promotional information and surveys. You are suggested to choose to keep in touch with the merchants because they will send you some useful information on promotions, coupons and new surveys. With these information, you can save more and get more chances to win big prizes.
