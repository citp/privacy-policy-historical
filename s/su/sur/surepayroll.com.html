                    <b>SECURITY</b><br>
                    SurePayroll protects your data with state-of-the-art equipment 
                    and procedures. <br>
                    <br>Anytime you are logged into the SurePayroll 
                    Web site, you will be in a "secure session" that is established 
                    with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and verified by VeriSign's 
                    Global Site Certificate technology. While connected with SSL, 
                    every transmission between your computer and SurePayroll is 
                    encrypted with 128 bit (strong) encryption, completely hiding 
                    your data while it travels to us. <br>
                    <br>We even have employed an 
                    automatic time-out feature. If your session is inactive for 
                    more than 10 minutes, you are automatically logged out, preventing 
                    unauthorized access. Your payroll data is stored in our data 
                    center which has Kevlar-lined walls, bullet-proof glass and 
                    24-hour security guards. <p></p>
                    <p>We have taken every reasonable measure we know of to ensure 
                    that your data remains private.If you have any questions, please feel 
                    free to e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@surepayroll.com">info@surepayroll.com</a>
