A FAQ about our Privacy Policy is available [here.](http://www.surfrider.org/pages/privacy-policy-faqs)

#### 1\. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

The Effective Date of this Privacy Policy is set forth at the top of this webpage. As we add new features, we may need to modify this Privacy Policy.   Whenever possible, we will provide you with advance written notice of our changes.  Your continued use of the Services after the Effective Date constitutes your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy.  The amended Privacy Policy supersedes all previous versions.  We will not, however, make retroactive changes that reduce your privacy rights unless you affirmatively agree to those changes.

**“General Information** ” is information about an individual’s online activity that, by itself, cannot be used to identify him or her, such as browser type, operating system and the dates/times of Services access.

Personal Information and General Information may be linked together. Different types of General Information also may be linked together and, once linked, may identify an individual person.

#### 3\. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION

Depending on applicable law, some Usage Data is Personal Information and some is General Information. 

**c. Information Collected from Other Sources:** Third parties that assist us with our business operations also collect information (including Personal Information and Usage Data) from you and share it with us.  For example, we may purchase mailing lists and use email service providers that help us to more effectively administer our communications and programs.

#### 5\. ONLINE ADVERTISING, DATA COLLECTION AND “DO NOT TRACK”

**a. Cookies & Other Data Collection Tools.** “ **Data Collection Tools** ” means technology that that collects information about your use of the Services and potentially about your activities when you leave the Services and visit other sites on the Internet, such as cookies and web beacons. 

**b.   Online Advertising.  **The Services use Data Collection Tools to help manage our online advertising program. These Data Collection Technologies are provided by us as well as our ad management partners and other third parties.

In addition, we and our ad management partners may use these Data Collection Tools to track the actions of users of the Services, to measure statistics of our marketing efforts, to deliver advertisements on the Services that may be more relevant to you and that will improve your experience on the Services, and to deliver advertisements to you when you  visit other third party sites.  

**c.   ****How We Respond to Browser “Do Not Track” Signals:** Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” ( **DNT** ) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked.  If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain Personal Information about the browser’s user.  Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.  For this reason, we and many website operators do not respond to DNT signals.  For more information about DNT signals, visit http://allaboutdnt.com.

Instead, Surfirder Foundation has entered into an agreement with Trustcommerce, a third party payment processing service,  to store, process and transmit your credit card data when you make a donation to us.
