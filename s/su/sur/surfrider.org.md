# Surfrider Foundation Privacy Policy | Surfrider Foundation

A FAQ about our Privacy Policy is available [here.](http://www.surfrider.org/pages/privacy-policy-faqs)

Welcome to www.surfrider.org (the “ **Site** ”), a website operated by the Surfrider Foundation (“ **Surfrider** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **us** ”, or “ **our** ”). We are a non-profit grassroots organization dedicated to the protection and enjoyment of the world’s oceans, waves and beaches. We provide our users (collectively, “ **you** ” or “ **your** ”) with resources and information about our organization and our cause, as well as a number of related services (collectively, the “ **Services** ”). We know you are concerned about your privacy, so we developed this privacy policy (“ **Privacy Policy** ”) to explain how we collect, use, and disclose information from and/or about you, whether you are simply visiting our Site or whether you are a member of our organization.

  
YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY. BY USING THIS SITE AND PROVIDING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE TRANSFER OF DATA FROM YOUR COUNTRY TO A COUNTRY THAT HAS LESS STRINGENT LAWS, AND THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CONFORMANCE WITH THIS POLICY.

  
So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase “ **Personal Information** ” in this Privacy Policy, we mean contact information (e.g., name, address, email address, or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual. When we use the phrase “ **Anonymous Information** ” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is neither used nor intended to be used to personally identify an individual.

  
**How We Collect Information.**  
_Personal Information_  
In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Services to you and helps us learn more about the use of the Site and/or Services. We collect Personal Information that you or someone else submits to us voluntarily through the Site or the Services. If you are a member of our organization (“ **Member** ’), paying for a Member’s annual dues, or making a donation to Surfrider, we may also collect Personal Information offline. One type of Personal Information we collect is “ **Payment Information** ”, which means the information necessary to process a payment from you, including the following: (i) your name as it appears on the card, (ii) the credit card type (VISA, MasterCard, American Express or any other issuer then accepted by Surfrider), (iii) a valid credit card number; (iv) the date of expiration of your credit card, (v) your billing address, and (vi) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge your card.

To receive our newsletter, you must provide your email address. When you communicate with us through our Site or by sending us an email, we may collect and store any information that is contained in your communications with us. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Site or Services you are able to use.

If you become a Member, we will need to collect additional Personal Information about you to process and administer your Membership. We may receive this Personal Information from you or, if a third party buys you a gift Membership to our organization, from the party paying for your Membership. If you do not wish for us to collect or hold information about you that you did not provide to us, please see the section below regarding deleting and changing your information. If you are the party paying for a Membership but are not yourself a Member, the only personal information we collect about you will be your Payment Information.

If you wish to donate to Surfrider, we will collect your Payment Information for such donation.

  
One of the Services we provide is our application on through http://www.facebook.com (“ **Facebook** ”), through which you may make certain Personal Information available to us. You do not need to be a Member to use this application. You may restrict and edit the Personal Information that you make available to us by editing your privacy settings on Facebook. We do not collect or record any Personal Information through Facebook unless you expressly request us to do so to provide you certain Services (e.g., requesting Membership information or a newsletter subscription). We may collect the information about your use of the application on Facebook or that you otherwise make available, however, in anonymized manner such that your identity cannot be ascertained from such information. For example, we may record that a user “liked” content or the number of photos tagged by a user, but we will not record that you liked that content or that you tagged certain photos. We will consider this aggregated and anonymous information collected from Facebook as “ **Anonymous Information** ”.

_Anonymous Information_  
As you use the Site or Services, certain Anonymous Information may be passively collected and stored, such as your Internet protocol address, domain names, browser type, and access times. We may also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your browser while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies.

If you do not accept Cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or functionalities of the Site or Services, including signing up for Membership online.
