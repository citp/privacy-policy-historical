<p>Luth Research has been conducting market research through consumer surveys for more than 30 years. Long before the birth of e-business on the Internet, we were at the forefront of protecting the privacy of personal information provided to us by survey respondents. Now, through Luth Research’s SurveySavvy Online Community, we survey millions of people via the Internet as well as track web behavior using our SavvyConnect panel -- giving the consuming public even greater influence over products and services. Whether we are conducting market research online or offline, through surveys or other data collection processes, the confidentiality of personal information shared with us remains our number one priority. Luth Research has invested time and money to ensure that all information we receive from you through the Luth Research website (luthresearch.com), SurveySavvy website (surveysavvy.com), SavvyConnect application and other products and services is stored safely, securely, and in accordance with industry best practices. The protection of your personal information is our commitment to you. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices that apply to all products and services provided by Luth Research. Luth Research complies with the principles set forth in the Safe Harbor framework as outlined by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of data from the European Union. Luth Research also conforms to the Council of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO) Code of Standards and Ethics for Survey Research, the European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR) ICC/ESOMAR International Code of Marketing and Social Research Practice and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). If you have questions or concerns regarding this privacy statement, you should contact <a href="mailto:support@surveysavvy.com">support@surveysavvy.com</a> by email. Your privacy is important to us. By participating in the Council of Better Business Bureaus’ BBBOnLine® Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the program’s strict requirements regarding how we treat your information. We also agree to have our treatment of your information verified by BBBOnLine®. Further information about this program is available at <a href="http://www.BBBonline.org/" target="_blank">www.BBBonline.org</a> Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>Registering to participate with Luth Research, LLC at SurveySavvy is easy. We ask you to fill out a form providing us with certain personal information. We collect information such as name, address, email address, phone number, gender, employment status, household income, education level, marital status, household status, ethnicity and type of computer you use. After you register, we will ask you for additional information through our “Portraits”, which are used to match you with the most suitable surveys. Completion of “Portraits” is strictly voluntary. When you register with SurveySavvy , you agree: (i) to receive a confirmation email from us confirming your registration; (ii) to receive emails inviting you to participate in surveys with links to the surveys; (iii) when applicable, to receive emails inviting you to participate in voluntary sweepstakes that SurveySavvy may sponsor for its members; and (iv) to receive email responses to questions, comments or updates to your member profile that you submit to the Web site. You also agree to the establishment of your incentive account which shall be credited after you and/or one of your qualified referrals participate in a survey that is completed and validated by SurveySavvy.</p>
<h3>Use of Information</h3>
<p>The information collected during the registration process allows us to verify your eligibility, to determine which surveys are appropriate for you, and to contact you regarding participation in surveys or in voluntary sweepstakes that SurveySavvy may sponsor from time to time. We also use individual information to generate demographic data relating to the responses we receive to particular surveys. Survey results are disclosed in the aggregate to the clients of SurveySavvy who have requested such survey information. Our survey results only report aggregate information about demographic groups. Online surveys may reside on servers located at our offices, a client site or third party site(s) authorized by SurveySavvy. Survey responses are identified based upon a survey respondent identification number assigned to each respondent. No personally identifiable information is associated with such survey responses or provided to clients or third parties without the respondent's prior “opt-in” consent. The individual personal information you provide through the registration process is completely confidential - we never sell it nor do we share it with third parties without your consent (other than third party service providers who provide services necessary to the operation and use of this Web site and who have agreed to protect the confidentiality of such information that they may have access to as part of their provision of services). Your personal information is also used to credit your incentive account for completed and validated surveys and to compensate you when you request payment of your incentive credit balance. Your personal information (including your social security number) may be required for compliance with tax laws and may be disclosed to the appropriate taxing authorities, as required by law. As we are an independent market research company, SurveySavvy will not use your personal information to sell you products or services.</p>

These and other digital fingerprinting technologies are not used to collect data for any means other than the aforementioned reasons. Under no circumstances are these technologies used to prevent SurveySavvy members from deleting or removing cookies. Web and application server logs are used solely for security, support, troubleshooting and maintenance purposes. Similarly, Google Analytics is used to collect information for site optimization and user statistics but does not collect any personally identifiable information.</p>

In such cases the data is not be used for any purpose and is removed from the system.</p>
<h3>Social Networks and Social Media</h3>

If you do not agree with the changes made to this Privacy Policy, you may unsubscribe.</p>
<h3>Unsubscribe</h3>
<p>You don't have to participate in every survey; if you don't respond, we will contact you later about another survey. If at any time you decide that you don't want to participate in our surveys anymore, you can unsubscribe and we will send you an email indicating that we have processed your request to unsubscribe.

<p>SurveySavvy firmly believes in maintaining the security and confidentiality of all visitors to this Web site, regardless of age. SurveySavvy complies with all applicable provisions of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). Where a parent who is a member of SurveySavvy has indicated in their member profile that members of their household include children, SurveySavvy may, from time to time, request that such parent allow one or more of those children to respond to surveys specifically designed for children. The children of such members may only respond to such surveys on this Web site by using the email address and password of one of their parents with the prior consent of such parent. Surveys specifically designed for children to respond to shall relate to products and services that are age appropriate and shall only collect the following general demographic information about the respondent: the child’s age, gender and zip code (or larger geographic area) where the child resides. Such surveys shall not collect more personal information about the child than is reasonably necessary for marketing research purposes. The child’s survey responses shall be used for the same purposes and shall be subject to the same obligations, restrictions and conditions as any other member survey response. By providing an email address and password for the use of this Web site to any child, the parent has consented to the child’s participation in and response to surveys through this Web site. Parents have the right to: (i) consent to the collection and use of personal information of their children without also consenting to the disclosure of such information to third parties; (ii) review personal information collected from their children; (iii) request that personal information of their children be deleted; and (iv) refuse the further collection of personal information of their children. In the event a parent believes that their child is using their email address and password to access this Web site without authorization, has registered as a member of this Web site using false information, or wishes to exercise any of the parental rights set forth in this section, such parent may contact us at Luth Research, LLC. 1365 Fourth Avenue, San Diego, California 92101 (888) 588-4258 or email using the Contact Us form.</p>
