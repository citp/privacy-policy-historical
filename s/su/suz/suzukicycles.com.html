<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;">If you visit Suzuki's Website to read product information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit. The information that we collect does not personally identify you and cannot be linked back to you unless you decide at some point to identify yourself. If you are browsing, we may collect the following information: the type of browser and operating system used, the IP address, the date and time you access our site, the number of times you have accessed our site, whether your computer is enabled for Java or cookies, browser language, application and plug-ins, the pages you visit and if you linked to Suzuki.com from another website, the address of that website. We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to better provide you with a smooth and efficient experience in using our website.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Use of Cookies </strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;">Cookies are pieces of information that a Website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes so that we may track site and user activity. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at most major Websites. By showing how and when visitors use the site, cookies help Suzuki to determine better which areas of our site are popular and which areas are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of our site will not function properly if you do so.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Surveys</strong> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;">Periodically, we may request visitors to provide information and feedback in the form of surveys. These surveys are voluntary and the visitor always has the option to decline. Any information collected will be used to evaluate the products and services of Suzuki.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information to Provide a Service or Correspondence</strong> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;">There are instances where Suzuki requests and collects information which may be personally identifiable to provide the website visitor a service or correspondence (e.g., e-newsletters, promotions, mailed brochures, and/or quick quotes). This personal information, such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, type of request, and possibly additional information, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data, and may be passed on to our dealerships, data aggregators and fulfillment associates. Once our dealerships, data aggregators or fulfillment associates receive this information that data also becomes the property of the dealerships, data aggregators or fulfillment associates. Any request to opt out of future communications from such dealers or fulfillment associates must be made to the dealers or fulfillment associates directly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Transmission of Information </strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;">Transmission of information through our website can be unstable, unreliable and insecure.

Suzuki will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site. Suzuki does not store this information and the information is used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Personally Identifiable Information Collected Through Sweepstakes, Giveaways, or Promotional Events</strong> </p>
