<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;">There are instances where Suzuki requests and collects information which may be personally identifiable to provide the website visitor a service or correspondence (e.g., e-newsletters, promotions, mailed brochures, and/or quick quotes). This personal information, such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, type of request, and possibly additional information, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data, and may be passed on to our dealerships, data aggregators and fulfillment associates. Once our dealerships, data aggregators or fulfillment associates receive this information that data also becomes the property of the dealerships, data aggregators or fulfillment associates. Any request to opt out of future communications from such dealers or fulfillment associates must be made to the dealers or fulfillment associates directly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Transmission of Information </strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;">Transmission of information through our website can be unstable, unreliable and insecure. Suzuki makes every effort to ensure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information using industry-accepted data collection and encryption methodologies such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy); there is a risk however, that information may be intercepted illegally.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>E-news and Promotional E-mails</strong> </p>

We send e-mails only if the user has opted to receive communications from Suzuki through its websites or sweepstakes. If a user elects to use our referral service to inform a friend about our site, we ask the user for the friend's name and e-mail address. Suzuki will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site. Suzuki does not store this information and the information is used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Personally Identifiable Information Collected Through Sweepstakes, Giveaways, or Promotional Events</strong> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;">There will be times when we offer sweepstakes, giveaways, or other promotional events through this website. In such cases, we may ask you for personally identifiable information in order to process your entry. There may be other times we request personally identifiable information. IN ALL SUCH CASES, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO SHARE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH CERTAIN CAREFULLY SELECTED ASSOCIATED COMPANIES, ALL OF WHOM HAVE AGREED TO ABIDE BY THE TERMS OF THIS ONLINE PRIVACY AND USE POLICY AND TO COMPLY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW.
