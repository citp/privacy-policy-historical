<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Use of Cookies </strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 8.05pt; line-height: 8.6pt; text-align: justify;">Cookies are pieces of information that a Website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes so that we may track site and user activity. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at most major Websites.
