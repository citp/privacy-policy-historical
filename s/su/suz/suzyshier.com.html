					<h2>Privacy policy</h2>
	
				<p><strong>Suzy Shier</strong> and its affiliates (“<strong>Suzy Shier</strong>”) respect your right to personal privacy. This Privacy Policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) describes our privacy practices. When you use a <strong>Suzy Shier</strong> website (“Site”), visit our stores, register with <strong>Suzy Shier</strong>, become a <strong>Prestige Member</strong> (“<strong>Membership</strong>”) or purchase a product online or in one of our stores, we may collect, store, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may change or add to this Privacy Policy, so we encourage you to review it periodically and to check for updates when you provide us with additional personal information.</p>
<p>We have included in this Privacy Policy details related to how we collect, store, use and protect the information you decide to provide to us. This Privacy Policy identifies:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;why we collect your personal information; <br>
•&nbsp;the information that is collected by <strong>Suzy Shier</strong>; <br>
•&nbsp;how we use and store your information; <br>
•&nbsp;how we may share your information; and <br>
•&nbsp;how you may contact <strong>Suzy Shier</strong></p>
<p>You can visit our stores and our Site without identifying yourself or providing any personal information, though please note that certain of our stores may contain in-store security cameras, both in public and “employee-only” areas of the store. At certain times, however, we may ask you to provide certain personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>At <strong>Suzy Shier</strong> we allow you to control how we contact you. We will respond to your customer inquiries using the contact information that you provide to us. We may send you promotional material by mail, Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, text message (SMS), mobile communication device, telephone or other means. This Privacy Policy explains how you can control how we contact you.</p>
<p><u><strong>Unsolicited Emails and Telephone Calls</strong></u></p>
<p>Please do not share/send personal information (and particularly financial/credit card information) in response to any unsolicited e-mail or phone call that appears to come from <strong>Suzy Shier</strong> or its affiliated companies or brands. We will <u>not</u> contact you and ask for such information; such information is only submitted when completing an order.</p>
<p><strong><u>Why do we collect your personal information?</u></strong></p>
<p>We collect information from you in order to provide you with an interesting, safe, convenient and personalized online shopping experience and for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We may retain certain personal information in order to improve the personalization of your subsequent visits. We also collect information from you in-store and on-line to comply with our legal and contractual obligations and to facilitate transactions. We also collect personal information to assist us in preventing, deterring and detecting criminal activities and other wrongful conduct on our premises and on-line. With your express or implied consent, we may collect your personal information to use for promotional purposes.</p>
<p><strong><u>What personal information does Suzy Shier collect?</u></strong></p>
<p><u>Information about you</u></p>
<p>We receive and may retain various information voluntarily given to us by you when you visit our Site, make a purchase on-line or in our stores using your credit card or debit card, register online, purchase a Membership, take part in a special promotion, register to receive newsletters or promotional material, apply for employment with us or when you provide any other information or unique preferences to us for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy. This information <u>may</u> include:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;your name, address (including postal/zip code) and phone number; <br>
•&nbsp;your date of birth; <br>
•&nbsp;your e-mail address; <br>
•&nbsp;your IP address; <br>
•&nbsp;photographs or videos of you; <br>
•&nbsp;your credit card and other financial information; <br>
•&nbsp;your resume; <br>
•&nbsp;proof of your identity; and <br>
•&nbsp;any other information that you may voluntarily provide through the Site or other means, including through Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Flickr, Tumblr, Vimeo, any sort of mobile communications device or any other social media.</p>
<p>We may also receive information about you from other sources in compliance with applicable privacy legislation, such as updated address information, financial and credit history information in connection with payment processing, or previous employment related information. This information may help us to improve our ability to service your needs such as ensuring the accurate delivery of mailed materials.</p>
<p><u>Information about others</u></p>
<p>The information we collect might also include information you provide us about other people. For example, you may provide us with the name and address of a merchandise gift or gift card recipient. When you provide us with personal information about the intended recipient of a shipment, we use that information for the purposes of processing the shipment and, in some cases, to communicate with the intended recipient to provide information pertaining to the status of the shipment. <strong>We rely on you to obtain the intended recipient's consent to our use of the personal information for these limited purposes.</strong></p>
<p><u>Cookies and other technologies</u></p>
<p>A “cookie” is a small data file transferred to your computer’s hard drive that allows a website to respond to you as an individual, gathering and remembering information about your preferences in order to tailor its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes. Cookies also enable an electronic retailer like <strong>Suzy Shier</strong> to keep track of a customer’s electronic “shopping cart” before completing a purchase. When your computer accepts a cookie it does not provide us with access to your computer or any personal information about you other than the information you choose to provide to us.</p>
<p>Most browsers will allow you to remove cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. However, if you block or turn off cookies, certain features might not be available to you and our ability to personalize your experience would be limited.</p>
<p><strong><u>How we use your personal information</u></strong></p>

In addition, we may use your IP address to determine your geographical location, in order to customize the promotional material we may send to you from time to time.</p>
<p><u>Contests</u></p>
<p>When you provide us with personal information in connection with a contest, we will use that information in connection with the administration of contests and other purposes disclosed in the contest entry rules.

<p><u>Our Service Providers and Government</u></p>
<p>Certain business services are performed on our behalf and at our request by other companies. We may securely share your information with selected vendors that perform services for <strong>Suzy Shier</strong>, such as hosting, data and promotional service providers and printing companies. To perform these services, these companies may, at times, utilize some of the personal information you have provided to us, and such use shall be governed by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. Your personal information is used solely for the purposes <strong>Suzy Shier</strong> has requested of these third party companies, such as maintaining our database, administering and monitoring e-mails, displaying offers and contest administration.</p>
<p>We may also share your personal information with governmental agencies or other entities, including credit reporting agencies, assisting us in fraud prevention or investigation or where we are required or permitted to do so by law or contract. We may do so when trying to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or unauthorized transactions, or investigating fraud that has already taken place. In addition, we may disclose your personal information to third parties who you have authorized to obtain that information. For example, when you make a purchase by credit card, we will forward certain information to your credit card provider in the course of processing that transaction.</p>
<p><u>Sharing within our Organization or a Potential Purchaser</u></p>
<p>If you have consented to receive promotional material from us, <strong>Suzy Shier</strong> may share your information with affiliated companies and brands of YM Inc., which currently include Suzy Shier, Bluenotes, LA Express, Stitches, Sirens, Siblings, Mariposa, Thrifty’s and Urban Planet, and any future affiliated companies and brands of YM Inc. We may provide you with their promotional materials and additional information about their products, services, contests or promotions.</p>
<p>Information we collect from you may be shared between all points of contact within <strong>Suzy Shier</strong> if it is necessary to share that information for the purpose for which we collected it. Those points of contact include employees in our stores, customer service representatives and individuals involved in online and other purchase fulfillment.</p>
<p>In the event that <strong>Suzy Shier</strong> is sold to or merges with another company, we may disclose your personal information to the purchaser or the new company formed from the merger.</p>
<p><strong><u>How Suzy Shier protects and stores your personal information</u></strong></p>
<p>Your personal information will be kept confidential. It is stored and processed on computers located in Canada and the United States of America. We use administrative, procedural and technical safeguards to protect your information against loss or theft as well as against unauthorized access or disclosure in order to protect your privacy. These protections include firewalls and encryption.</p>
<p>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your credit card information as it is transmitted to us. SSL is the industry standard for secure online commerce transactions. It prevents your personal information from being read by someone else as it travels across the Internet. All of your personal information is encrypted, including your credit card number, name and address.</p>
<p>While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit using the Internet, third party digital networks, websites, mobile devices, the Site or any social media platform.</p>
<p><strong>We cannot be responsible for Internet fraud or theft. Please keep this in mind when providing information through the Site.</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>How long do we retain your Personal Information?</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Suzy Shier</strong> retains your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws. Your consent to such purposes(s) remains valid after any termination of our relationship with you.</p>
<p>When you make a purchase online through our Site, we will not retain your credit card information after the purchase has been authorized by the appropriate financial institution. <strong>Suzy Shier</strong> does retain the authorization number provided at the time of authorization in order to deal with credit which might be requested in the event that the purchased item is returned.</p>
<p>If you visit a store that is monitored by video security, we may temporarily capture your image for security purposes. Security recordings are only reviewed in the event of an incident and are overwritten after a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p><strong><u>Children and this Site</u></strong></p>
<p>Children under age 13 may not use the Site and should not provide any personal information to us. The Site is not intended for or targeted to use by children.</p>
<p>Please note that children under the age of 13 may not participate in casting calls or modeling initiatives, and may not apply for employment with <strong>Suzy Shier</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><u>Exercising your options about receiving promotional communications</u></strong></p>

<p>Write to us at <strong>YM Inc., 50 Dufflaw Rd., Toronto, Ontario, CANADA, M6A 2W1</strong></p>
