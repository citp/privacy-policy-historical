** Totally-Traffic.com ** ****  has established this Privacy Policy consisting of ten principles, to protect and manage your (the customer’s) personal information.  Totally-Traffic.com will occasionally update this Privacy Policy.  When it does, Totally-Traffic.com will also revise the “last update” date at the top of this Privacy Policy.  For changes to this policy, Totally-Traffic.com will notify you by placing a notice on its web site home page.

Totally-Traffic.com collects, at time of your registration and your sign-on to its web site, certain “personal information” (information that personally identifies you) such as your name, email address, home or work address, telephone number, and your computer hardware and software (e.g. IP address, operating system, browser type, domain name, URL, access times, and referring web site addresses), a listing of which can be found by clicking here.

Totally-Traffic.com has implemented this Privacy Policy to protect personal information received from its customers, and to respond to any inquiries and complaints.  The Privacy Policy also provides that Totally-Traffic.com will use appropriate contractual means to establish a comparable level of protection for personal information which is sent for processing by third parties on Totally-Traffic.com’s behalf .

Totally-Traffic.com has designated responsibility for your personal information to its Privacy Officer, who ensures compliance with the principles in this Privacy Policy.  Other Totally-Traffic.com individuals may be delegated to act on behalf of the Privacy Officer.

A customer may withdraw such consent for collection, use and disclosure at any time, on prior written notice, provided that Totally-Traffic.com may on such withdrawal suspend or terminate its products and services.

Totally-Traffic.com will use reasonable efforts to keep customer personal information accurate for the Identified Purposes, and for minimizing the possibility of making inappropriate customer decisions based on such information.  Customers are responsible for informing Totally-Traffic.com about changes to their personal information.  Totally-Traffic.com will update personal information when necessary to keep it accurate or else provide customers the facility to make such updates. 

Totally-Traffic.com will use reasonable efforts to protect personal information against loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, misuse or modification, through security safeguards that depend on the level of sensitivity of the information.  Methods of protection include organizational measures (contract provisions, security clearance, limiting access to need-to-know Totally-Traffic.com personnel), technological measures (passwords, encryption), and physical measures (locked file storage, security card access).  Totally-Traffic.com will control personal information disclosed to authorized third parties by entering into agreements which contain confidentiality provisions and restrictions on use and which limit the amount of information disclosed to only that which is needed for the Identified Purposes.

This Privacy Policy, and all updates to the Privacy Policy made from time to time, are published and made available to Totally-Traffic.com’s customers on its web site.  It is the customer’s obligation to periodically check the Totally-Traffic.com web site for Privacy Policy updates.

---|---  
  
Totally-Traffic.com will afford you a reasonable opportunity to review the personal information in your file, in understandable format, either by direct access or upon request to the Privacy Officer made by you after providing sufficient identification.

If Totally-Traffic.com is not able to provide access to some aspect of a customer’s personal information, it will provide reasons for denying access such as; that by doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party, or that it is confidential commercial information or attorney–client privileged communications, or that the information relates to a breach of an agreement or a contravention of law, or that its disclosure could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual.

Customers have the right to request that inaccurate or incomplete information be amended as appropriate, and Totally-Traffic.com will promptly correct such personal information or provide the means for you to do so directly.

Each customer will be informed of the outcome of the investigation regarding the customer’s complaint.
