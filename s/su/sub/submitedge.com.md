Use of traffic data

Each time a visitor comes to a SubmitEdge Web site, we collect some information to improve the overall quality of the online experience. At SubmitEdge content sites, we collect the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from ibm.com or yale.edu), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to a SubmitEdge Web site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). The SubmitEdge site collects visitor information for purposes of product monitoring, product improvement and targeted advertising. We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the SubmitEdge properties, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but SubmitEdge will not disclose your individual identity or personal data without your permission. When SubmitEdge does present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.
