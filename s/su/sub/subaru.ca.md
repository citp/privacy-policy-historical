####  CONSENT 

The way in which Subaru obtains your consent to collecting, using, or disclosing your personal information varies depending upon its sensitivity and applicable privacy law. We may ask for your consent directly or our Dealers may obtain your consent on our behalf. Your consent also may be implied or implicit through your conduct when it is reasonable and legally permissible for us to do so. 

We will honour any specific consents you provide to us regarding the collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information. You may withdraw or change your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions, by giving us reasonable notice. In appropriate cases, we will inform you of any implications of withdrawing your consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to retain, collect, use, and disclose your personal information and to contact you where we are legally required or permitted to do so. 

We will not, as a condition of the supply of services, require you to consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information beyond that which we require for our purposes.

####  COOKIES, PIXELS AND OTHER WEB TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES 

Subaru may use cookies, pixels and other web tracking technologies on our websites, mobile apps, email messages and advertisements to gather information about your visit (as described in the Collection of Personal Information section above) and provide you with a personalized experience. Cookies and pixels are industry-standard technologies used by most major commercial websites. 

Our websites use cookies to distinguish you from other users of our websites and mobile apps and allows you to maintain your account login information or contact information on any request form (e.g. requesting a quote or test drive). This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you use our websites and mobile apps and also allows us to improve their functionality. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer or mobile device if you agree to it. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's or mobile device’s hard drive. 

Please note that third parties (including, for example, our third-party business partners) may also use cookies or other web tracking technologies, over which we have no control. 

You block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block cookies, all or parts of our websites and mobile apps may not function correctly and your experience on our websites and mobile apps may be hindered. 

Pixels (as known as web beacons/web bugs/Javascript) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are used to track the online movements of web users, track what other websites you visit (both before and after visiting our websites), or to determine whether you have performed specific actions. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user's computer or mobile device hard drive, pixels are small graphics that are about the size of the period at the end of the sentence that are embedded invisibly on web pages or in HTML-based messages. When you access our websites or open our messages, the pixels generate a notice of that action to us or our third-party business partners. 

Please note that the MySubaru website and mobile app do not respond to “do not track” beacons or other such signals. Please see the MySubaru section below for more information. 

####  ONLINE TRACKING AND ADVERTISING 

Subaru may partner with third-party advertising companies that use their own tracking technologies (including cookies, pixels and other web tracking technologies) on Subaru and non-Subaru websites and mobile apps in order to provide you with tailored advertisements on our behalf. 

These third-party advertising companies may collect information about your online activity across multiple devices on Subaru and non-Subaru websites and mobile apps and use this information to make predictions about your preferences and then deliver advertisements on our behalf that are more relevant to you. 

If you would like more information about advertisers' use of tracking technologies to deliver targeted ads to you, or to opt-out of receiving targeted ads by advertising networks participating in certain opt-out programs, you can go to: <https://youradchoices.ca/choices/>. 

We also encourage you to check the privacy policies of social networks that you belong to and to adjust your advertising settings on those social networks with regard to targeted advertising delivered on those social networks, including by Subaru if the social network is our business partner. 

Please note that, even if you are able to opt-out of certain kinds of ads, you will continue to receive non-targeted ads. Further, you may continue to receive targeted content and/or ads from parties that do not participate in the opt-out programs. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser(s), or use a non-browser-based method of access, your opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Subaru is not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. 

####  MYSUBARU 

MySubaru is both a website and mobile app that is designed to allow you to access and store information about your vehicle in one place. When creating your account, you will be asked to enter information specific to you and your vehicle. This includes your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address, as well as your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). To protect you, and to keep this information private, you will be asked to establish a Username and Password. Your account can only be accessed with the correct Username and Password combination. 

Subaru keeps a database of the information collected by this site, on your behalf, to allow you future access to your information. This database is located in the United States. Your information in the database will be commingled with information about Subaru customers in the United States and other markets but is subject to appropriate security safeguards. Please see the International Transfers of Personal Information section below to learn more about how we protect information located in foreign jurisdictions. Please note that any information you enter while registering for your account will be retained in the database regardless of whether you complete the account registration process. If you decide not to register for an account and you would like the information you entered anonymized, please contact Subaru’s Privacy Officer at the contact information at the end of this Policy. 

If you have enrolled for SUBARU STARLINK® Connected Services, you will receive certain billing information. You will not be able to opt-out of receiving billing information. 

As indicated in the Cookies, Pixels and Other Web Tracking Technologies section above, the MySubaru website and mobile app do not respond to “do not track” beacons or other such signals. Accordingly, when you log into your MySubaru account through the website or mobile app, Subaru will be able to identify you still and collect your information. 

####  MOBILE APPS 

Subaru has developed certain mobile apps (including MySubaru) that you may download to your mobile device. When you access our mobile apps, we may ask you for information about you and your vehicle. If you do not wish to provide this information, please decline to use the mobile app and/or uninstall the mobile app from your mobile device. 

When you use Subaru’s Infotainment system, you may have access to mobile apps developed by third parties. When you download a third-party mobile app to your mobile device, the third party may ask you for information. Subaru is not responsible for any information collected by third-party mobile apps and the third-party mobile apps are not subject to this Policy. Please review carefully the privacy policies of third-party mobile apps before providing any personal information. 

####  THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, WEBSITES AND MOBILE APPS 

When using Subaru products, services, websites or mobile apps, you may be able to access third party products, services, websites and mobile apps that are not controlled by Subaru and therefore not subject to this Policy. Please review carefully the privacy policies of third-party products, services, websites and mobile apps before providing any personal information. 

####  SUBARU DEALERS 

Subaru and its Dealers are separate legal entities with their own privacy policies and practices. For questions about your Dealer’s privacy policy and practices, including opting out of marketing communications from your Dealer, please contact your Dealer directly. 

When you purchase or lease a vehicle or obtain service for your vehicle from your Dealer, your Dealer will share your information with Subaru. While Subaru encourages its Dealers to ensure their privacy policies and practices are compliant with applicable privacy laws, Subaru is not responsible for its Dealers’ compliance with applicable law. 

####  SAFEGUARDS 

Subaru protects the personal information it holds or controls, by establishing reasonable security arrangements against loss, theft, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, copying or modification. We train our employees on the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of personal information, and we exercise care in the disposal or destruction of personal information. Examples of safeguards include physical measures (such as locked filing cabinets and access cards), organizational measures (such as security clearances and restrictions on employee access to files and databases) and technological measures (such as passwords and firewalls). Also, we require our third-party service providers acting on our behalf to enter into contracts with us that ensure they will keep the information we share with them safe and secure. 

####  INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 

Subaru transfers information outside of Canada including but not limited to the United States and Japan, for processing by Subaru, its parent company (Subaru Corporation), affiliates or third-party service providers for some or all of the purposes described in the Use of Personal Information section above. We use contractual and other means to ensure the information is protected while in the foreign jurisdiction. However, personal information may be still accessible to law enforcement agencies, government agencies, courts, and national security authorities of the foreign jurisdiction. If you have questions about our policies and practices regarding service providers outside of Canada, please contact Subaru’s Privacy Officer at the contact information at the end of this Policy. 

####  ACCURACY 

Subaru will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the personal information we have is accurate, complete and up-to-date as necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used, including information that is disclosed to third parties, and information that is used to make a decision about an individual. Our reasonable efforts include obtaining updated information from our Dealers when you service your vehicle at the Dealer. 

####  RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 

We keep information we collect for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in the Use of Personal Information section above or as required or permitted by applicable privacy law. Once no longer required, we will anonymize or destroy the information. 

When determining retention periods, we consider certain criteria including the following: 

  * whether the purposes for which we collected the information have been fulfilled; 
  * whether destroying the information will impact the services provided to you; 
  * whether the information has been used to make a decision about you in which case we will continue to retain that information for at least one year after using it to make the decision to reasonably allow you time to access the information and to exhaust any access request or challenge you may bring under applicable privacy laws; and 
  * retention periods required by law. 



####  ACCESS AND UPDATE TO PERSONAL INFORMATION 

You have a general right to access your personal information in our possession or custody. Upon receiving a written request (mail or e-mail) from you addressed to Subaru's Privacy Officer clearly identifying the requested information with adequate information to identify you, we will inform you of the existence, use, and disclosure of your personal information and give you access to your personal information. If we are not able to provide a list of the organizations to which we may have actually disclosed your personal information, we will provide you with a list of organizations to which we may have disclosed the information. 

We will respond to your written access request with information in a form that is generally understandable, within a reasonable timeframe (generally within 30 days) or we will provide you with an explanation if additional time is required to fulfil your request. Our response will typically be provided for a minimal handling fee which we reserve the right to vary depending on the nature of the request and the amount of information involved. We will inform you of the approximate cost to provide the response, and will provide you with the information upon receipt of payment. 

You may question the accuracy and completeness of your personal information and request that we amend it as appropriate. If you demonstrate in a reasonable manner the inaccuracy or incompleteness of your personal information, we will amend the information as required. If a request is not resolved to your satisfaction, we will record the substance of the unresolved request. Where appropriate, the amended information or the existence of the unresolved request will be transmitted to third parties having access to the information in question. 

In some situations, we may be permitted to refuse or not be able to provide access to certain personal information, and will upon request provide an explanation. Exceptions to the access right which are permitted or required by applicable privacy laws include the following: 

  * information that contains references to other individuals or contains confidential commercial information (where such information cannot be severed from the record); 
  * information collected in the course of investigating a breach of an agreement or in the course of a formal dispute resolution process; and 
  * information that is subject to solicitor-client privilege. 



To make access requests to us for your personal information, please contact our Privacy Officer at the contact information at the end of this Policy. 

####  CHALLENGING COMPLIANCE

You agree that you will have the consent of, or will have the authority to consent on behalf of, the Authorized User to transmit his/her personal information to Subaru for this purpose. 

Your consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information in connection with the SUBARU STARLINK® System or the SUBARU STARLINK® Services may also be implied or implicit through your conduct when it is reasonable and legally permissible for us to do so.

####  CONTACTING YOU

####  SAFEGUARDS 

Subaru protects the personal information it holds or controls, by establishing reasonable security arrangements against loss, theft, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, copying or modification, commensurate with industry standards. We train our employees and Dealers on the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of personal information, and we exercise care in the disposal or destruction of personal information. Examples of safeguards include physical measures (such as locked filing cabinets and access cards), organizational measures (such as security clearances and restrictions on employee access to files and databases) and technological measures (such as passwords and firewalls). 

Also, we require our third party service providers acting on our behalf to enter into contracts with us that ensure they will keep the information we share with them safe and secure. For example, our third-party service provider that processes your payment for SUBARU STARLINK® Services must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), which is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. This includes encrypting payment information using Secure Socket Layers (SSL) and transmitting it over a private Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network. Our third-party service provider that maintains your MySubaru account is required to encrypt all back-ups of personal information, logically separate the personal information we transmit to it from the personal information of its other customers, and use industry-standard password policies. 

As an additional security measure, we provide you with a Personal Identification Number (PIN), which you are required to use when you access certain SUBARU STARLINK® Services. Our SUBARU STARLINK® Connected Services Representatives may also ask you certain security questions to authenticate your identity. You must keep your MySubaru account password, security question answers and PIN safe from unauthorized access. If others have access to this information, then they may be able to access certain SUBARU STARLINK® Services. 

In providing SUBARU STARLINK® Services to you, voice and data are transmitted between our SUBARU STARLINK® Connected Services Representatives and your vehicle over a cellular telephone network. While our third-party service providers must secure data transmitted over this network, the network is complex, and the privacy and security of conversations or data transmitted to and from the vehicle cannot be guaranteed. 

####  INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 

Subaru transfers information outside of Canada including but not limited to the United States, Sweden, India and Japan, for processing by Subaru, its parent company (Subaru Corporation), affiliates or third-party service providers for some or all of the purposes described in the Use of Personal Information section above. We use contractual and other means to ensure the information is protected while in the foreign jurisdiction. However, personal information may be still accessible to law enforcement agencies, government agencies, courts, and national security authorities of the foreign jurisdiction. If you have questions about our policies and practices regarding service providers outside of Canada, please contact Subaru’s Privacy Officer at the contact information at the end of this Policy. 

####  ACCURACY 

Subaru will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the personal information we have is accurate, complete and up-to-date as necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used, including information that is disclosed to third parties, and information that is used to make a decision about an individual. Our reasonable efforts include obtaining updated information from our Dealers when you service your vehicle at the Dealer. 

####  RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 

We keep information we collect for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in the Use of Personal Information section above or as required or permitted by applicable privacy law. Once no longer required, we will anonymize or destroy the information in a secure manner. 

When determining retention periods, we consider certain criteria including the following: 

  * whether the purposes for which we collected the information have been fulfilled; 
  * whether destroying the information will impact the services provided to you; 
  * whether the information has been used to make a decision about you in which case we will continue to retain that information for at least one year after using it to make the decision to reasonably allow you time to access the information and to exhaust any access request or challenge you may bring under applicable privacy laws; and 
  * retention periods required by law.
