In an effort to comply with the law, and our commitment to protect your personal information, we provide the following, which discloses our policies. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not govern the privacy policies and procedures of DAI’s independently owned and operated SUBWAY® stores. 

**What type of information do we collect?**  
Personal Information is any information concerning the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual. An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. 

Personal Information shall include but is not limited to: identifying information such as name, home address, home telephone number, e-mail address, Social Security number, financial information and employment-related information such as may be found on resumes, applications, background verification information, or in employment references. 

We will not collect sensitive Personal Information, except to comply with Affirmative Action data requirements.  Sensitive Personal Information can include but is not limited to: information pertaining to gender, disabilities and veteran status. 

**Cookies – Internet Users**  
In addition to Personal Information, we use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain web pages to help analyze our web page flow and measure promotional effectiveness. Cookies are pieces of information a website sends to an individual’s hard drive while they are viewing the website. Cookies allow the website to remember important information that will make your visit to the site more useful. We use cookies to help improve your future visits.

The “Help” option on your browser may assist you in changing your cookie preferences. Please note that by turning cookies off, you will not have access to many features available on our website.

**Children and Data Collection**  
 We care about the safety of children. We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information. Children under 13 years of age are required to obtain the express permission of a parent or guardian before submitting any Personal Information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet.

**Our Use of Your Information**  
We use your Personal Information to facilitate the services you request. We have tailored our Privacy Policy to adequately inform you of the use of your Personal Information. 

**Collection and Use of Employee Personal Information**  
DAI also collects Personal Information from its employees and applicants (human resource data) in connection with administration of its Human Resources programs and functions.  These programs and functions include, but are not limited to: job applications and hiring programs, compensation and benefit programs, performance appraisals, training, access to DAI facilities and computer networks, employee profiles, internal intranet employee directories, Human Resource recordkeeping, Affirmative Action data, and other employment related purposes.

It is the policy of DAI to keep all past and present employee information private from disclosure to third parties. There are certain business related exceptions and they are: 

  1. To comply with county, state or federal agency requests; 

  2. Inquiries from third parties with a signed authorization from the employee to release the information, except in situations where limited verbal verifications are acceptable (see below);

  3. Third parties with which DAI has contractual agreements to assist in administration of company sponsored benefits. 




**Verifications of Employment**  
Prospective employers, state agencies, financial institutions, and residential property managers routinely contact DAI requesting information on a former or current employee's work history and salary. All such requests of this type shall be referred to and completed on a confidential basis by the Human Resources Department or Payroll Department. 

For written verification of employment requests, information will be provided on the form only when it is accompanied by an employee's signed authorization to release information. The form will be returned directly to the requesting party and filed as part of the Human Resources or Payroll Department’s confidential records.

DAI is compliant with federal HIPAA regulations and only utilizes information related to the company sponsored healthcare plan on a "need to know" basis for administration of the healthcare plan.

**Collection and Use of Customer Information**  
DAI will not collect customer Personal Information, unless the customer contacts DAI directly. In order to adequately address a customer’s concern, their Personal Information may be shared with the area Development Agent and franchisee. Development Agents assist with franchise sales, site location, training, and provide operational assistance to franchisees. Failure to provide necessary information may prevent DAI from fully addressing any customer concerns.

If you are a participant in the Online SUBWAY® Store, we ask for contact information, name, shipping address, phone number, and e-mail address. In the future, we may use this information to contact you regarding products or promotions, as well as other products and services, which may be of interest to you. At any time you may “opt out” of future contacts by un-subscribing from our database or contacting the Privacy Officer.
