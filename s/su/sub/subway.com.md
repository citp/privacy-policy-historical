**Important Information Regarding the U.S. – EU and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks**

U.S. – EU and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Compliance

FWH, DAI, and SFAFT, are in compliance with the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor requirements regarding the transfer of Personal Information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland to the United States. Despite an adverse judgment by the European Court of Justice on October 6, 2015, the U.S. Department of Commerce has advised that it continues to administer the Safe Harbor program until further notice. FWH, DAI, and SFAFT, have been Self-Certified under the Safe Harbor privacy frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, European Commission and Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland regarding the collection, storage, use, transfer and other processing of personal data transferred from the European Economic Area or Switzerland to the U.S., in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament, and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) effective July 1993, modified January 2008. Organizations that Self-Certify under Safe Harbor must comply with the U.S. – EU and the U.S. - Swiss “Safe Harbor” Frameworks Privacy Principles which are: 

  * **Notice** \- Individuals must be informed that their data is being collected and about how it will be used;
  * **Choice** \- Individuals must have the ability to opt out of the collection and forward transfer of the data to third parties;
  * **Onward Transfer (Transfers to Third Parties)** \- Transfers of data to third parties may only occur to other organizations that follow adequate data protection principles;
  * **Security** \- Reasonable efforts must be made to prevent loss of collected information;
  * **Data Integrity** \- Data must be relevant and reliable for the purpose for which it was collected;
  * **Access** \- Individuals must be able to access information held about them, and correct or delete it if it is inaccurate;
  * **Enforcement** \- There must be effective means of enforcing these rules.



Further information regarding the “Safe Harbor” Frameworks privacy principles and certification process can be found at: [www.export.gov/safeharbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor).

In addition, the U.S. Department of Commerce maintains lists of compliant organizations (i.e., the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor List and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor List), which can be accessed at: http://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx and https://safeharbor.export.gov/swisslist.aspx. FWH uses a self-assessment approach to assure compliance with this Privacy Statement and periodically verifies that this Privacy Statement is accurate, easily accessible, prominently displayed, abides by, and contains the information intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor Frameworks, as stated above.
