protection and management of personal information that you provide to us.&nbsp; This 
Privacy Policy will assist you to understand what types of information we may 
collect, how that information may be used, and with whom the information may be 
shared.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In an effort to comply with the law, and our commitment to

allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information. 
Children under 13 years of age are required to obtain the express permission of 
a parent or guardian before submitting any Personal Information about themselves 
(such as their names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Our Use of Your Information</b><br>
We use your Personal Information to facilitate the 
services you request. We have tailored our Privacy Policy to adequately inform 
you of the use of your Personal Information.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Collection and Use of Employee Personal Information</b><br>
DAI also collects Personal Information from its employees 
and applicants (human resource data) in connection with administration of its 
Human Resources programs and functions.&nbsp; These programs and functions include,

benefit programs, performance appraisals, training, access to DAI facilities and 
computer networks, employee profiles, internal intranet employee directories, 
Human Resource recordkeeping, Affirmative Action data, and other employment 
related purposes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">It is the policy of DAI to keep all past and present 
employee information private from disclosure to third parties. There are certain 
business related exceptions and they are: </font></p>
												<ol style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt">
													<li>
													<p>
													<font face="Arial" size="3">To comply with county, state 
	or federal agency requests; </font></p></li>
													<li>
													<p>
													<font face="Arial" size="3">Inquiries from third parties 
	with a signed authorization from the employee to release the information, 
	except in situations where limited verbal verifications are acceptable (see 
	below);</font></p></li>
													<li>
													<p>
													<font face="Arial" size="3">Third parties with which DAI 
	has contractual agreements to assist in administration of company sponsored 
	benefits. </font></p></li>
												</ol>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Verifications of Employment</b><br>
Prospective employers, state agencies, financial 
institutions, and residential property managers routinely contact DAI requesting 
information on a former or current employee's work history and salary. All such 
requests of this type shall be referred to and completed on a confidential basis 
by the Human Resources Department or Payroll Department. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">For written verification of employment requests, 
information will be provided on the form only when it is accompanied by an 
employee's signed authorization to release information. The form will be 
returned directly to the requesting party and filed as part of the Human 
Resources or Payroll Department’s confidential records.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Medical Information</b><br>
DAI is compliant with federal HIPAA regulations and only 
utilizes information related to the company sponsored healthcare plan on a "need 
to know" basis for administration of the healthcare plan.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Collection and Use of Customer Information</b><br>
DAI will not collect customer Personal Information, unless 
the customer contacts DAI directly. In order to adequately address a customer’s 
concern, their Personal Information may be shared with the area Development 
Agent and franchisee. Development Agents assist with franchise sales, site 
location, training, and provide operational assistance to franchisees. Failure 
to provide necessary information may prevent DAI from fully addressing any 
customer concerns.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">If you are a participant in the Online SUBWAY® Store, we 
ask for contact information, name, shipping address, phone number, and e-mail 
address. In the future, we may use this information to contact you regarding 
products or promotions, as well as other products and services, which may be of 
interest to you. At any time you may “opt out” of future contacts by 
un-subscribing from our database or contacting the Privacy Officer.</font></p>

a prospective franchisee’s ability to become a franchisee. Once a prospective 
franchisee becomes a franchisee, they may then reference themselves by their 
Franchise Agreement Number. In order to better service franchisees, a 
franchisee’s Personal Information may be shared between DAI and its affiliates, 
pursuant to the service contracts between them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In order to effectively implement the SUBWAY® Gift Card 
Program, a franchisee’s Personal Information may be shared with an independent 
purchasing cooperative or other independent third party. The Personal 
Information shared with the independent purchasing cooperative shall include, 
but will not be limited to: name, address, and bank account information you

purchasing cooperative may bill a franchisee’s bank account for fees and other 
costs associated with the SUBWAY® Gift Card Program. If a franchisee does not 
wish to disclose this information, they must notify the Privacy Officer in 
writing as described in the section titled “Contact Information” below.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">A franchisee and prospective franchisee’s information may 
be shared with the Development Agent in their area. A Development Agent is an 
independent contractor of DAI or one of its affiliates. Development Agents 
assist with franchise sales, site location, training, and provide operational 
assistance. Development Agents also make recommendations as to whether a 
prospective franchisee in their territory should be granted a franchise. The 
Development Agent may use this information to: address a franchisee’s concerns 
in a customer complaint, respond to a franchisee’s inquires for franchise sales, 
and any other inquiry which may require a response. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">A franchisee’s information may be shared with our third 
party service provider in order to implement Subway Express™ through the

party service provider directly or DAI may supplement additional franchisee

impact your ability to become a Development Agent.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Sharing of Personal Information</b><br>
We may share Personal Information with our service 
providers, consultants and affiliates for our internal business purposes. Except 
as described in this Privacy Policy, DAI will not share Personal Information 
with a third party, unless a customer requests, consents to such disclosure, or 
disclosure is required or authorized by law. DAI reserves the right to disclose 
Personal Information to a third party if a law, regulation, search warrant, 
subpoena, or court order legally requires or authorizes us to do so. DAI also 
reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer Personal Information to a third 
party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale, lease, merger, 
amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, or financing of all or 
any portion of DAI or of any of the business or assets or shares of DAI or a 
division thereof in order for a franchisee or Development Agent to continue to 
receive the same products and services from the third party.</font></p>

service providers and Development Agents may share and exchange Personal

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">We take all reasonable steps to insure that your Personal

located in the United States and/or other countries outside of the United 
States.&nbsp; Additionally, some of our service providers may reside in the United
