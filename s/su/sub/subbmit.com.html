<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <div class="body">
      <p>Subbmit is founded on the principles of helping people to discover new information by enabling them to share what they find interesting with one another. Subbmit knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the Subbmit website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers Subbmit's treatment of personal information that Subbmit gathers when you are on the Subbmit website and when you use Subbmit services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Subbmit does not own or control, or to individuals that Subbmit does not employ or manage.</p>
<h3>Information Collected by Subbmit</h3>
<p>We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website, which is to enable users to discover and share information with one another. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with this objective. We collect the following types of information from our Subbmit users:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Information You Provide to Us: </strong><br>
We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.<p></p>
<p>Registration: In order for you to use Subbmit services, such as submitting new links to the website, you must complete a registration form. As part of this registration form, we require select personal information (including your full name, city, state and e-mail address).</p>
<p>User Profile: To allow you to express yourself beyond just the information collected during registration, we enable you to provide additional information, such as a bio, favorite URLs, and instant messaging IDs. In addition, you may choose to include photos of yourself in your profile. As indicated below, in the section titled "Sharing Your Information", you can control how your information is displayed and used.</p></li>
<li><strong>Automatic Information: </strong><br>
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Subbmit and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, Subbmit cookie information, and the page you requested. Subbmit uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.<p></p>
<p>Subbmit may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. This includes User Profile pages.</p>
<p>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While Subbmit will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3>E-mail Communications</h3>
<p>Subbmit is very concerned about your privacy and we will never provide your email address to a third party without your explicit permission, as detailed in the "Sharing Your Information" section below. Subbmit may send out e-mails with Subbmit -related news, products, offers, surveys or promotions. You may also receive notification e-mails from Subbmit, which inform you of actions (e.g. friend requests) that have been performed on the site. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please visit the Email Preferences section of your User Profile and/or follow the instructions contained in the unwanted e-mail message. However, please note that in all cases you will continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g. those regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g. updates to our policies) from us.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Subbmit cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.</li>
<li>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some of Subbmit's coolest features.</li>

You may control what personal information is displayed in your User Profile by visiting the Privacy Settings section of your User Profile.</li>
<li>Member Directory: The e-mail address that you submit upon registration will be searchable by other Subbmit users who know you by your email address, unless you choose to opt out of this feature.
