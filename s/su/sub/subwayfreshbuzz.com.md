  **8\. Internet Users - Cookies, Internet Protocol (IP) Address, Aggregate Information  **\- (Top)****

Cookies \- in addition to Personal Information, we use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain web pages to help analyze our web page flow and measure promotional effectiveness.

A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the 'lifetime' of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site and services.

A few important things you should know about cookies are that:

  * We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies.
  * We use cookies to better your web experience.
  * Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.
  * You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the sites that we do not control. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page.)



Disabling/enabling cookies - You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. However, you may not be able to use all the interactive features of our site if cookies are disabled.

Web Beacon - Also called a Web bug or a pixel tag or a clear GIF. We use pixels tags or transparent GIF files, to help manage our online advertising and promotions. These tags collect anonymous (not personally identifiable) information about which advertisements and promotions bring users to our website. With both cookie and tag technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

Used in combination with cookies, a Web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, which is placed on a Web site or in an e-mail that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the Web site or sending the e-mail. When the HTML code for the Web beacon points to a site to retrieve the image, at the same time it can pass along information such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that retrieved the image and previously set cookie values.

Web beacons are typically used by a third-party to monitor the activity of a site. A Web beacon can be detected by viewing the source code of a Web page and looking for any IMG tags that load from a different server than the rest of the site. Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent Web beacons from tracking the user's activity. The Web beacon will still account for an anonymous visit, but the user's unique information will not be recorded.

Internet Protocol (IP) Address - an Internet Protocol (IP) Address is associated with your computer's connection to the internet. SFCAT may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with SFCAT's server, to administer the Website and to maintain contact with you as you navigate through the Website. Your computer's IP address also may be used to provide you with information based upon your navigation through the Website. SFCAT does not link IP addresses to any Personal Information.

Aggregate Information – is used to measure the visitors' interest in, and use of, various areas of the Website and the various programs that SFCAT administers, SFCAT will rely upon aggregate information, which is information that does not identify you, such as statistical and navigational information. With this aggregate information, SFCAT may undertake statistical and other summary analyses of the visitors' behaviors and characteristics. Although SFCAT may share this aggregate information with third parties, none of this information will allow anyone to identify you, or to determine anything else personal about you.

**9\. Compliance with the Digital Advertising Alliance  **\- (Top)****

The SUBWAY® Group uses the Evidon assurance platform to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) ([http://aboutads.info](http://aboutads.info/)). As part of this service, The SUBWAY® Group's online advertisements and Web sites are sometimes delivered with icons that help consumers understand how their data is being used and provide choice options to consumers that want more control. The list of our advertising partners may be updated from time to time. To opt-out of internet-based advertising by all DAA-participating companies, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

**10\. Interest-Based/Online Behavioral Advertising  **\- (Top)****

On some pages of our site we may allow third-party advertising partners to set web tracking tools (e.g., cookies and web beacons) to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information regarding your activities on those pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such information we have collected with third-party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering future targeted advertisements to you when you visit other (non-SUBWAY®) sites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or "online behavioral advertising." Pages of our website that collect information that may be used by such advertising partners for interest-based advertising purposes may be identified by a link to AdChoices on the page.

Opting out (site pages). If you do not want your browsing while on such pages to be used for interest-based advertising purposes, you may click on the AdChoices link to opt-out of such uses by the listed advertising partner(s). Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your site activities and use it for non-interest-based advertising purposes as described in this privacy statement.

Opting out (advertisements). Advertisements on third-party sites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this privacy policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-personally identifiable information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners' use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes. Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect and use information from the advertisements for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.

**11\. Children and Data Collection  **\- (Top)****

At SFCAT, children's privacy is important to us. SFCAT adheres to the United States Federal Privacy Protection standards as stated in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). We will not knowingly allow anyone under thirteen (13) to provide us any personally identifying information. Children under thirteen (13) years of age are required to obtain the express permission of a parent or guardian before submitting any Personal Information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail address, and phone number) over the Internet. If a child has provided us with personally-identifiable information without the consent of a parent or guardian, the parent or guardian of that child should contact the Privacy Officer immediately at [privacyofficer_ca@subway.com](mailto:privacyofficer_ca@subway.com). We will use reasonable efforts to promptly delete the child's information from our servers.

**12\. A Note to Parents/Guardians—Additional Information About Children's Privacy  **\- (Top)****

In the United States, websites that are collecting information from children under the age of thirteen (13) are required to comply with Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). COPPA requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under thirteen (13) years of age; and that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under thirteen (13) years of age to use certain features of our website. Also, when we use the term "parent", we mean to include legal guardians.

Children can participate in many of our features without providing personally identifiable information. However, to enable their participation in certain of our interactive features, we may ask children to provide us with personally identifiable information. The types of information we may request include first name as well as the child's and parent's email addresses. We use a child's email address to respond to a specific request to participate in an activity (e.g., participate in a contest or sweepstakes, respond to their question, enable them to subscribe to a newsletter). We use parents' e-mail addresses to obtain their consent or notify them of their child's online activities and enable the parent to unsubscribe the child from a newsletter or other similar activity.

Sometimes, we use third party service providers to help us conduct contests or sweepstakes, send prizes to winners, or provide customer service related to activities on the website. These third party service providers are contractually obligated to adhere to this Privacy Policy. As such, these third party service providers are required to keep the information confidential and to use it only for the specific services they are performing on our behalf.

At any time parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their child and can request that any personal information we have collected be deleted from our records.

We will provide parents notice by e-mail of any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and/or share their child's personal information. Please note that, at all times, parents should update their personal information to provide us a current email address.

If you would like to review any personally identifiable information that we have collected online from your child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child's information, or if you have questions about these information practices, you may contact our Privacy Officer.

We require our affiliates within the SUBWAY® Group and their Development Agents to respect SFCAT's privacy practices and not use your personal information for purposes other than to carry out our instructions.

By applying to become a SUBWAY® franchisee, a prospective franchisee consents to the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
