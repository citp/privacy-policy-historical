**1\. What information do we gather and track, and what do we do with it?**

Registration is free. We use information you provide on the registration form for accounting and contact purposes (for example, to respond to your queries or for other customer service issues or to issue VAT invoices).   
We may use your registration information to send you information about our company and our services. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time; use the newsletter form, contact form or email us if you wish to be removed from any mailings.

    * Third parties Where you use our site to enter into a transaction or correspond with another company or person, we may provide information supplied by you (or collected about you) to that other party in order to facilitate the transaction or the correspondence, we only include your contact details, but do not give any payment details like credit cards etc as it is your responsibility to settle the items bought directly with the vendor. 

**Changes in our business**  
If all of the assets which we use to operate our business (or substantially all of them) are acquired by a third party, we may transfer personal data we then hold to that party. In the unlikely event that an insolvency practitioner (such as a liquidator) is appointed in respect of our business, that practitioner may sell, trade or rent personal data we then hold.

**3\. Security**

We are committed to the security of customer information and we have security procedures in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control. Our online payments are taken directly by our bankers secure servers, so no payment information is entered into our server. If you do not have a secure browser or do not wish to send your credit card details over the web using a secure browser, you are welcome to open an account by fax, phone or letter.   
Additionally, we have security measures in place to protect our customer database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your account by keeping your password secret and exiting from our web site when you are not using it.
