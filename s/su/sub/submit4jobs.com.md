You can contact us at any time with questions or concerns about privacy by sending an email to [etsinfo@ets.org](mailto:etsinfo@ets.org) or by writing to us at the addresses in the Contact section below.

## Information We Collect

We collect the following types of Personal Information from you when you use our Website: 

  * Contact Information that allows us to communicate with you, such as your name, username, mailing address, telephone numbers, email address or other addresses that allow us to send you messages.
  * Relationship Information that helps us do business with you. For test takers, this may include the types of tests that you want to take, your school affiliation, expected degree and graduation date, and similar information that can help us offer you personalized content. For professionals, this may include your professional credentials and affiliations and the products and services that may interest you or your school.
  * Transaction Information  from your online activities, registrations and purchases, including your registration records, purchase history, order information about your use of our content (such as if you access your scores online, use test prep material or complete surveys), customer account information (such as if you email us for support) and payment card information as needed to process your payments.



In some cases, we may need to collect additional information in order to administer tests to you or to fulfill other requests that you may make. For example:

  * As permitted by law (and as needed for your test), we may collect additional Personal Information at the test center such as your photograph, your fingerprint, voiceprint, writing samples, and images and voices in videotapes and audiotapes (including from premises monitoring equipment).
  * If you request an accommodation from us regarding test arrangements for medical or religious reasons, we may collect Personal Information relevant to your request. Similarly, if you request a fee waiver, fee reduction or scholarship, we may collect Personal Information about your financial situation. Providing Personal Information about your religion, disability or medical condition, and/or financial status is optional, but if you are requesting an accommodation from ETS, you must provide the information so that we can process your request.



When you visit and interact with our Website, we may also collect information that uses cookies and other data collection technologies. Please see the section on Cookies below to learn more.

## Disclosure of Your Personal Information

We will only disclose your Personal Information as follows:

  * We may disclose your Personal Information to our affiliates, who will only use your Personal Information for the purposes listed above.
  * We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties that provide services to us. For example, when you register for a test, we will provide certain registration information to third parties that administer the tests in your area. We use service providers for other functions as well, such as printing, mailing and/or payment processing. We require such third-party processors to use your Personal Information in accordance with our directions and these processors may not use your Personal Information for their own purposes. 
  * We may disclose your Personal Information as needed to provide services to you. For example, if you ask us to, we will disclose your test scores to schools and others. We may also share your Personal Information with our partners, but only to the extent that you have a relationship with such partner or you authorize the sharing. We may share information with test prep providers, if you elect to use the materials or as needed to validate referrals and operate the platforms.
  * We may also disclose Personal Information in accordance with applicable law, in connection with any sale or transfer of our business or assets, to assert or defend our rights and property, or to prevent harm to others. For example, we may disclose Personal Information to third parties when we investigate claims of misconduct, invalid test scores or other incidents that may occur in our test centers. We will also always disclose Personal Information when required to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, including to law enforcement agencies and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate.

The Purposes and Legal Basis for Processing, Including Legitimate Interests   
The Privacy Notice explains the reasons why we process your Personal Information. We only process Personal Information when we have a legal basis for the processing, such as:

  * To fulfill a contract with you, such as to provide you with an ETS test or a test offered by another company through ETS.
  * For closely related purposes, such as payment processing and financial account management, contract management, website administration, business continuity and disaster recovery, security and fraud prevention, corporate governance, reporting and legal compliance.
  * With your consent (or provided you have not objected, as may be applicable), such to provide you with marketing communications or to send your scores to your designated recipients.



We may also process your Personal Information for the purposes of our legitimate interests, provided that such processing shall not outweigh your rights and freedoms. In particular, we may process your Personal Information as needed to:

  * Protect you, us or others from threats (such as security threats or test fraud)
  * Improve ETS’s tests and support ETS Research Initiatives
  * Comply with the laws that are applicable to us around the world

Automated Decision Making and Profiling    
ETS may use automated processes in connection with scoring tests and for similar purposes as needed to provide the test services that you have requested. All such decisions are subject to human review. We will not make automated decisions about you that may significantly affect you, unless (1) the decision is necessary as part of a contract that we have with you, (2) we have your explicit consent, or (3) we are required by law to use the technology. You can learn more about test scoring by reading the information posted on our Website about each of our tests.

In some cases, we use certain elements of personal data for ETS Research. For example, we may consider how certain types of test takers (such as nonnative English speakers) respond to specific test questions. Our research initiatives reflect our commitment to fairness and equity in testing, helping to ensure that are our tests are accessible and free from bias. They also seek to improve teaching, learning and assessment. Our research results do not contain any identifiable data, and are not used to target or profile individuals. Learn more about [ETS Research](https://www.ets.org/research).

When You are Required to Provide Personal Information to ETS   
In most cases, you are not required by law to provide any Personal Information to ETS. You are required to provide certain Personal Information to enable us to enter into a contract with you so that you can use our products and services. Our registration forms indicate which data elements are required for our contracts. If you do not provide these data elements, we cannot do business with you.

If you request an accommodation from ETS, such as special testing conditions needed because of a health condition or disability, you may be required to submit additional Personal Information (including special categories of data) as needed for us to evaluate and respond to your request.

Your Rights    
As stated in the Privacy Notice, you always have the right to object to our marketing communications. To opt out of emails, simply click the link labeled “Unsubscribe” at the bottom of any email we send you.

  * You have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Information.
  * You may also ask us to delete or restrict your Personal Information.

International Transfers   
As stated in the Privacy Notice, your Personal Information may be transferred to, stored at or processed in the United States and other countries which may not have equivalent privacy or data protection laws.
