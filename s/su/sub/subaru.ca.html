      <p><span class="header">SCOPE OF POLICY</span> <br>
        <strong><font color="#000000">“Personal Information”</font></strong> as used in this Privacy Policy means
        information about an identifiable individual. This Privacy Policy does
        not apply to the collection, use or disclosure of business contact information

        to certain publicly available information.</p>
      <p><span class="header">ACCOUNTABILITY <br>

      </ul>
      <p>Unless applicable privacy laws provide otherwise, Subaru will make a
        reasonable effort to specify the identified purposes in a readily understandable
        way to the individual from whom the personal information is being collected,
        either at the time of collection or after collection but before its use
        or disclosure.</p>
      <p><span class="header">CONSENT</span> <br>
        The way in which Subaru obtains your consent to collecting, using or
          disclosing your personal information will vary depending upon its sensitivity.
          An individual can withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or
          contractual restrictions, by giving to Subaru reasonable notice. In
          appropriate cases, Subaru will inform individuals of any implications
          of withdrawing consent. Subaru will not, as a condition of the supply
          of services, require an individual to consent to the collection, use,
          or disclosure of personal information beyond that required to fulfil          the specified purposes.</p>
      <p>In certain circumstances as permitted or required by law, Subaru may
        collect, use or disclose personal information without the knowledge or
        consent of the individual. These circumstances include the following:
        to investigate a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a law;
        where collection or use is clearly in the interests of the individual
        and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way; personal information
        subject to solicitor-client privilege; for debt collection; to act in
        respect to an emergency that threatens an individual; or to comply with
        a subpoena, warrant or court order.</p>

      <p><span class="header">LIMITS FOR COLLECTING, USING AND DISCLOSING PERSONAL 
          INFORMATION</span> <br>
          Subaru will limit the amount and type of personal information collected
          to that which is necessary for our identified purposes. Personal information
          will not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which
          it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required
          by law.</p>      <p>          Personal information will be retained only as long as necessary to
            fulfil the identified purposes, and will be destroyed or made anonymous
            as soon
          as reasonably possible after the original purpose is no longer served
          by the retention of the information, provided the personal information
          no longer required for legal purposes. Personal information which has
          been used to make a decision about an individual will be retained long
          enough to reasonably allow the individual access to the information
            after the decision, and long enough to exhaust any access request
            or a challenge
          an individual may bring under applicable privacy laws.</p>      
      <p><span class="header">ACCESS </span><br>
        All individuals generally have a right to access their personal information 
        in Subaru’s possession or custody. Upon receiving a written request (mail, 
        e-mail or fax) addressed to Subaru’s <u><a href="mailto:privacyofficer@mysubaru.ca">Privacy 
        Officer</a></u> clearly identifying the requested information with adequate 
        identification of the requesting individual, Subaru will inform the individual 
        of the existence, use, and disclosure of the personal information and 
        give the individual access to that personal information. If Subaru is 
        not able to provide a list of the organizations to which it may have actually 
        disclosed the personal information, it will provide a list of organizations 
        to which it may have disclosed the information.</p>
      <p>          Subaru will respond to an individual’s written access request,
          with information in a form that is generally understandable, within a
          reasonable time (generally within 30 days) or will provide an explanation
          if additional time is required to fulfil the request. While Subaru’s
          response will typically be provided at no cost to an individual, depending
          on the nature of the request and the amount of information involved,
          Subaru reserves the right to impose charges. In such case Subaru will
          inform the individual of the approximate cost to provide the response,
          and will provide the information upon receipt of payment.</p>
      <p> Individuals can question the accuracy and completeness of their personal
            information and request that it be amended as appropriate. If an
        individual demonstrates in a reasonable manner the inaccuracy or incompleteness
            of their personal information, Subaru will amend the information
        as
            required. If a request is not resolved to the satisfaction of the
        individual, Subaru
            will record the substance of the unresolved request. Where appropriate,
            the amended information or the existence of the unresolved request
            will be transmitted to third parties having access to the information
            in question.</p>
      <p> In some situations, Subaru may be permitted to refuse or not be able
              to provide access to certain personal information, and will upon
              request provide an explanation. Exceptions to the access right
        which are permitted
              or required by applicable privacy laws include: information that
              contains references to other individuals or contains confidential
              commercial
              information (where such information cannot be severed from the
        record); information
              collected in the course of investigating a breach of an agreement
              or in the course of a formal dispute resolution process; and information
              that is subject to solicitor-client privilege.</p>

      <p><span class="header">ACCURACY</span> <br>
        Subaru will strive to ensure that the personal information it uses on
          an ongoing basis is accurate, complete and up-to-date as necessary
          for the purposes for which it is to be used, including information
          that is disclosed to third parties, and information that is used to
          make a decision about an individual.</p>
      <p><span class="header">SAFEGUARDS</span> <br>
        Subaru protects the personal information it holds or controls, by establishing
          reasonable security arrangements against loss, theft, unauthorized
          access, use, disclosure, copying or modification. Subaru will make
          its employees aware of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality
          of personal information, and will exercise care in the disposal or
          destruction of personal information. Examples of safeguards include
          physical measures (such as locked filing cabinets and access cards),
          organizational measures (such as security clearances and restrictions
          on employee access to files and databases) and technological measures
          (such as passwords and firewalls).</p>
      <p><span class="header">OPENNESS <br>
        </span>Subaru will make the following readily available: general information
        concerning our Privacy Policy; how to gain access to your personal information;
        the type of personal information held by Subaru; a general account of
        the use and disclosure of the personal information; and how to contact
        our Privacy Officer.</p>
      <p><span class="header">CHALLENGING COMPLIANCE <br>
        </span>Subaru will, on request, provide information regarding its procedure
        for addressing any complaints made with respect to Subaru’s application
        of privacy laws. Subaru will investigate all written complaints, and
        if it finds a complaint to be justified, Subaru will take the appropriate
        measures, including, if necessary, amending our policies and practices.</p>
