  <h2>4. California OPPA (Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003)</h2><blockquote>
  <p>4.1 It is the intent of the    Privacy Policy to comply with the California Act. Various provisions    throughout this Privacy Policy address requirements of the act. In summary,    you must presume that we collect electronic information from all visitors.    This is not usually personally identifiable. If you purchase a product or    service via this website (and thereby become covered by the Act), the    purchase agreement you electronically sign prior to purchase allows the    website to collect and archive all the personal information you provide and    to transmit and/or transfer that personal information to third parties. There    is no way you can modify this information and you have no right to do so.    Under the terms of the purchase agreement, you have no right to view or    receive any information about our database. In the event that the website, under    advice of counsel agrees to divulge information, the requesting party must    submit whatever information is demanded by the website to insure that the    website is releasing information to the correct party. Other provisions of    the OPPA may exempt this website from complying. While we take measures to    ensure that outside parties do not have access to any information we have    about you, we do not warranty that outside parties will not breach our system    and thus have access to your information. (You should know that merchant    service providers do not allow us access to your credit card information.)    This Privacy Policy also is subject to change without notice. You are    required to read it prior to using the website. By interacting with the    website you agree to the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy. By using    the website or purchasing a product through this website, you waive the right    to use state or federal court systems to address complaints and, instead,    agree to use the American Arbitration Association located in a city and    county specified herein.</p>
  </blockquote><h2> 5. Personal information this Website collects and how it is used </h2><blockquote>
  <p>5.1 This website routinely    collects information about its visitors, subscribers, members, and customers.    This information is obtained in various ways, such as:</p>
  <p>USER, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER,    OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION'</p>
  <p>5.2 Registration means that the    User, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active, positive steps to    communicate information to this website. This can include pages or 'pop ups'    where you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can    include your participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting    information from the website via email, mail, or courier; it may be from    joining an affiliate program or other membership organization, paid or    unpaid; it may be from ordering a product.</p>
  <p>5.3 Occasionally complete credit    card information may be provided to the website via fax or a fill-in form    rather than regular secure merchant service processing. This information is    kept at the highest level of security and is never divulged to anyone except    the merchant service provider or for the purpose of communication with the    customer.</p>
  </blockquote><h2>6. Online ordering </h2><blockquote>
  <p>6.1 Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master Card provides information to
the website but does not provide complete credit card numbers. In the process
of online ordering, the customer provides, name, address, city, state, email
address, phone number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member
password. You should consider all this information available to the website.
This information is used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase
Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>7. User email inquiries </h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>7.1 Website visitors who wish to    communicate with the website do so under two conditions: one, they give their    permission for contact by the website; two, they are subject to any ‘submission’    provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy Policy.    While your email address may or may not be used to solicit you, it is added    to the website's general solicitation database.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>8. Customer emails or testimonials </h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>8.1 If you are a customer and    send an email to the website, or if you communicate with the site by phone or    mail, the website collects information about your communication and by    communicating with the site you give your permission    to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise use any information collected as    the site sees fit.</p>
  <p>8.2 Any communication which, in    its sole discretion, the site deems to be a testimonial, may be publicized    for commercial purposes.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>9. Information obtained from visitor interaction with banners, popups, or advertisements</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>9.1 Users clicking on banners    or pop-ups or hyperlinked advertising, appearing on this website must assume    that information is being collected about them. This site is not responsible    for the use of information collected in such a fashion. Users must assume    that (1) information will be collected, (2) that ‘cookies’ will    usually be placed on their hard drive, (3) that this website does not have    any control over what happens with this information, (4) that this website    takes no responsibility over the accuracy or content of advertisers, (5) that    this website is not responsible for downloads from third party advertisers    that contain viruses or worms or other computer code that causes their    computer or software harm, and (6) that this website assumes no    responsibility for the data that is garnered from the click itself or that    the advertiser collects.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>10. Information obtained from referring email or rerring URLs</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>10.1 If you send a friend an    email from this site or if you send the url or one    of our web pages to a friend, you must assume that some data is collected    about your IP address or your email address and that of your friend. You must    assume that referred emails or web pages may appear to come from your email.    You must accept fully responsibility for referring pages or email to a friend    and agree to indemnify this site for any damage, intentional or unintentional    that results from said referrals.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>11. Information obtained from voluntary visitor, subscriber, member, or customer surveys</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>11.1 Unless otherwise specified    in the survey, you must assume that any information provided to the website    as part of a survey in which you participate may be used for general    solicitation for commercial purposes and that such information will be shared    with joint venture partners, affiliates, marketing organization or used by    the site itself for product design or solicitation purposes.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>12.  Information obtained from electionic means and "Cookies"</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>12.1 Many websites, including    this one, collect information about your computer, your email address, your    IP address. You must assume that your web-viewing or web-use activity is    monitored, tracked, and information collected. This information is not    usually of a personal nature, but it may help define your viewing habits and    product preferences even though the website may or may not have any idea who    you are.</p>
  <p>12.2 "Cookies" is web    jargon for bits of computer code placed on your hard drive. Websites use this    to keep you 'logged in', to keep track of search criteria, to monitor use, to    password protect use of the site or use of products sold by the site. Cookies    can also be used to obtain information about your computer configuration or    your use of your computer.</p>
  <p>12.3 Cookies can be used to    electronically gather information about you. Again, it may or may not be    personal information, but it is information and by using this site you are    expressly giving permission to use 'cookies' and to use the information    gathered from their use to benefit you. You also give permission to collect,    archive, retrieve, and use any information collected for product design,    product offers to you, and general commercial solicitation purposes by this    site or joint venture partners, affiliates, and marketing organizations.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>13. How information may be used </h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>13.1 The use of information as    described below may or may not be how information that is collected is    customarily used by this site. While actual use of any information collected    may be used quite conservatively, you must assume that it is not. You must    assume that information collected is shared with other persons or entities    for commercial purposes. While this is uncommon in practice, you must assume    that it is as you make your decision whether or not to view or interact with    this website. This type of shared information may include your name, address,    phone number, email address and buying habits, as well as other information.    This information may be used for general commercial solicitation by this    website or other persons it is sold to, rented to, or shared with.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>14. Information that is not shared </h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>14.1 Credit card information or    other financial information is not usually known to the website. However, in    the event that it is made known, that information is never revealed to anyone    except to processing authorities or law enforcement agencies. However, the    provider of such information gives express permission to use it in fraud    investigation or for litigation.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>15. Bulletin boards and public forums</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <p>15.1 Users, subscribers,    members, or customers who use any site provided bulletin boards or other    public forums, such as chat rooms, do so at their own risk.

  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  <p>16.1 By providing to this website    information that forms the basis of communication with you, such as an email    address, you waive all rights to file complaints concerning unsolicited email    or spam from this website since, by providing such information, you agree to    receive communication from us or other marketing organizations. However, all    email communication with you shall contain an 'unsubscribe' link where you    may notify the website that you no longer wish to receive solicitations or    information from the website and your name will be removed from the general    solicitation database.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  <p>16.1 This website takes measures    to protect its data that contains information related to you. However, as a    consideration for viewing this site or interacting with this site in any    manner, you waive all claims of any nature against this site concerning the    loss, alteration, or misuse of information. You must assume that it is    possible for your personal data to be obtained by others, such as    "hackers," and used in an inappropriate manner that may cause you harm and that you agree that the site is not    responsible for damages to you.</p>
