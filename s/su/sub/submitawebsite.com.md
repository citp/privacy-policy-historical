public may use the WHOIS Information. For the avoidance of doubt, and in order to comply with
certain applicable laws or other privacy requirements, we reserve the right to mask your
personally identifiable information as needed, including but not limited to, masking data published
to Port 43 or the WHOIS database.

or as required by law or contract. Where you have a contract with us, we will retain your data for
the length of the contract, and will further retain that information for a time period consistent with
our legal or regulatory responsibilities, after you terminate all your services with us to resolve
disputes, enforce our relevant Service Agreement, and to adhere to the technical and legal
requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of the Sites. If you

no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure
and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You can further help to ensure your security by
taking a few simple precautions. For instance, it is important to protect against unauthorized
access to your computer and to any Web.com username and password, and to be sure to sign
off when you are finished using a shared computer.
