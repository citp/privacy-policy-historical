  *  **Information We Generate:** We generate some information about you based on other information we have collected. For example, like many platforms, we use your IP address to derive the approximate location of your device. We also take notes and observations about the business contacts of our customers to help evaluate sales opportunities and about job applicants as part of our hiring process.
  *  **Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies:** For information about cookies and other tracking technologies we use, and options to disable them, please see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.sumologic.com/cookie-notice/).

We also obtain information about you from other sources. For instance, we receive information about contacts of potential customers through other sites that distribute our content or webinars, from data analytics and marketing services like Dun & Bradstreet and through refer-a-friend tools made available on our Services. This information includes your name, contact information (including email and phone), job title, and company.

## SHARING OF INFORMATION

We share information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement:

  * With companies and contractors that perform services for us, including email service providers, customer relationship management services, recruiting and applicant management services, and other service providers
  * In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements

We also share aggregated or other information not subject to obligations under the data protection laws of your jurisdiction.

## ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHERS

We allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These entities use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites and online services, including your IP address, device identifiers, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used by Sumo Logic and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites, and better understand your online activity. For more information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices). If you are in the EU, please visit [www.youronlinechoices.eu/](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). 

Various browsers allow a “do not track” (DNT) setting that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites visited by the individual about the individual’s browser DNT setting. At this time, there is no general agreement on how companies like Sumo Logic should interpret DNT signals. Therefore, Sumo Logic does not currently commit to respond to DNT signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device. 

## YOUR CHOICES

**Account Information**

You may update certain account information you provide via our Services (such as your name and email address) by logging into your account, but note that we retain certain information when required or permitted by law. 

**Promotional Communications**

You may opt out of receiving promotional emails or text messages from Sumo Logic by following the instructions in those emails or text messages. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.

**Data Retention**

We retain personal data no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed, unless applicable law requires storage for a longer period of time. 

**Data Transfer**

Sumo Logic processes and stores information in the U.S. and other countries, which may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. For example, we transfer personal data to our corporate affiliates located in the United Kingdom, Poland, United States, Japan, India and Australia for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. Transfers to Sumo Logic Inc. in the United States are pursuant to the Privacy Shield as discussed below. Transfers to other jurisdictions not deemed adequate by the European Commission are pursuant to Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission, copies of which are available [Here](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32004D0915) and [Here](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32010D0087).

**Privacy Shield Notice**

References to “we” or “us” in the following paragraph refer only to Sumo Logic Inc. We adhere to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework Principles issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the “ **Principles** ”) in connection with our transfer of personal data to the United States that relates to individuals in the EEA, UK and Switzerland (“ **Covered Data** ”). For more information about the Principles and to view our certification, please visit the Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website at [www.privacyshield.gov](http://www.privacyshield.gov/). You may contact us about any question or complaint regarding our adherence to the Principles as indicated in the ‘Contact Us’ section above. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>. Under certain conditions specified by the Principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. If we share Covered Data with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on our behalf, then we will be liable for that party’s processing of Covered Data in violation of the Principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
