# Sumdog Teacher Portal - Privacy Policy and Cookies

We are committed to protecting your personal information. This policy covers our use of any personal information we obtain from you when you use Sumdog.

* * *

### **What information do we collect?**

When you sign up for one of our services we may ask for personal information about you, such as your name, date of birth, your job and email address. By entering these details accurately it enables us to provide the best possible service.

Most of your information is stored on our servers. We may transfer your information to other countries for processing and storage. However, we will only do this in locations that follow the "Safe harbor" regulations (<http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>). We also use small files (such as cookies and licence files) to store some information on your computer. This reduces the amount of form filling required each time you use our websites or software.

With certain services we also look at your IP address and other data that identifies your computer and country. We use this to personalise your user experience for a particular country and to detect illegal use of our software. This information is not used to develop a personal profile of you.

We keep the emails you send to us about queries you may have. We do this so we can track the quality of our service.

### **How will we use the information we collect about you?**

We will use your personal information as follows:

  * to provide you with information in order to help you use one of our services, such as sending you an email notifying you of the end of a service trial period;
  * to personalise our services for you
  * to provide you with your licensing or login information.
  * to identify breaches of our licensing terms, so in the worst cases of abuse we may take action against illegal use. This helps maintain free services and lower prices for our law-abiding customers;
  * to process orders for, and administer, your Sumdog Subscriptions;
  * to request feedback from you about our services so that we may improve the service; and
  * to inform you of other & upgraded services that may be of use to you. If you do not wish to receive this information you may opt out.



Where Crocodile Clips uses your personal information for any other uses we will seek your permission prior to doing so.

### **Will we share your personal information with anyone else?**

  * when you have made a sales enquiry or joined the Leader in Technology initiative from a country where we have a partner. In this case we may forward your enquiry; or
  * when you have provided explicit permission to pass your information to a third party.



Except as described here, or where authorised by you in writing, we will not pass on your Personal Data to any other party.

In addition, we share statistics derived from collected information with our partners worldwide. The statistics do not enable our partners to identify you.

### **Content you post on our website**

If you post offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content on our websites, we may use your personal information to stop such behaviour.

Where we believe that you are or may be in breach of any law, we may use your personal information to inform relevant third parties such as your employer, school, e-mail/internet provider or law enforcement agencies.
