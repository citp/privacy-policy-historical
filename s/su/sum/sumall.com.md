**Generally, SumAll collects the following types of information:**

**Visitor Data & Anonymous Visitor Data:** When we refer to “Visitor Data” we mean data that allows someone to identify or contact a Visitor, including, for example, their name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about them that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. When we refer to “Anonymous Visitor Data” we mean data that is not used, or intended to be used, to identify a particular Visitor.

**Subscriber Data & Anonymous Subscriber Data:** When we refer to “Subscriber Data” we mean data that allows someone to identify or contact a Subscriber, including, for example, their name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about them that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. When we refer to “Anonymous Subscriber Data” we mean data that is not used, or intended to be used, to identify a particular Subscriber.

**Crazy Awesome Data & Anonymous Crazy Awesome Data:** When we refer to “Crazy Awesome Data” we mean all other data that relates to the Subscriber, the Subscriber’s business, or customers of the Subscriber and is not publicly available. This category of information can include but is not limited to data about a Subscriber such as exercise history, social media activities, or bank account information; data that is proprietary to the Subscriber’s business, including but not limited to figures and other data related to their business’s sales, revenue, costs, vendors, customers, inventory, website traffic, marketing activities, and social media activities; and/or personally identifiable information about the customers of a Subscriber or their business. When we refer to “Anonymous Crazy Awesome Data” we mean data that is not used, or intended to be used, to identify a particular Subscriber, their business, or a customer of a Subscriber.

**Subscriber Data vs Crazy Awesome Data:** When you give us your name or email address, for example, either during sign-up or contact with a customer service agent, then you are explicitly telling us who you are and the data is considered Subscriber Data. When you provide us with information about a bank account, however, we don’t know if it’s your bank account, your business’s account, or the account of your daughter, and as such it’s Crazy Awesome Data rather than Subscriber Data. In general all data is that is not explicitly Visitor Data or Subscriber Data, including most data provided via APIs and third parties, is considered Crazy Awesome Data.

Visitor Data, Subscriber Data and Crazy Awesome Data may be referred to herein collectively as “Personal Data.” Anonymous Visitor Data, Anonymous Subscriber Data and Anonymous Crazy Awesome Data may be referred to herein collectively as “Anonymous Data.”

## 3\. How we Collect Personal Data

We collect Personal Visitor, Subscriber and Crazy Awesome Data as described below:

**I.  Most Subscriber Data is Directly Provided to Us by You**

When you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply. We may collect your first and last name, e-mail address, physical address, phone number, business name, and password when you create an Account. We may collect Personal Data on the Site when we make clear that we are collecting it and you voluntarily provide it, for example, when you add additional services to your account. We also collect other types of data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, product registration number, and other requested information if you contact us regarding support for the Services. We retain information on your behalf, such as files and messages that you store using your Account.

**II.  Most Crazy Awesome Data is Acquired via APIs**

We may collect Crazy Awesome Data directly from you through the Site. We may also receive Crazy Awesome Data about you, your business or your customers from our partners, including our platform partners such as Shopify, Authorize, MailChimp, Facebook, and Google that may provide services to you or your business. This information may include various proprietary data relating to your business. This information may be shared with us manually or automatically through the establishment of an application programming interface (API) with our partner. We may add this information to the Crazy Awesome Data we have already collected from you via our Site in order to improve the Services we provide.

**III.  Most Visitor Data is Collected Through Technology**

To make our Site more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.

We also use cookies and URL information to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and viewed. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions, however, please note that certain aspects of the Site or Services may not be available if the Persistent Cookies are removed.

## 4\. What We Do With Personal Data

**I. Use of Subscriber and Visitor Data**

In general, Subscriber and Visitor Data are used either to respond to requests that you make or to aid us in serving you better. We use such Personal Data in the following ways:

  * to facilitate the creation and security of your Account on our network;
  * identify you as a user in our system;
  * provide improved administration of our Site and Services;
  * provide the Services you request;
  * improve the quality of experience when you interact with our Site and Services;
  * send you a welcome e-mail to verify ownership of the e-mail address provided when your Account was created;
  * send you administrative e-mail notifications such as security or support and maintenance advisories;
  * respond to your inquiries related to employment opportunities or other requests;
  * to make telephone calls to you, from time to time, as a part of secondary fraud protection or to solicit your feedback; and
  * to send newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials related to our Services and for other marketing purposes.



**II. Use of Crazy Awesome Data**

Unless we have a separate authorization from the data subject, we will not use the Crazy Awesome Data we collect for any reason other than to provide the Services the Subscriber requests and improve the quality of experience when the Subscriber interacts with our Site or Services. For illustration purposes only, we may use the name of a Subscriber’s customer to help the Subscriber analyze that particular customer’s spending habits as part of our Services, but we will never contact that customer directly for marketing purposes.

**III. Use of Data by Third Party Service Providers**

We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities. For example, these service providers may help us measure the performance of our online campaigns or analyze visitor activity on the Site. We may permit these service providers to use cookies and other technologies to perform these services for us. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our PP. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

## 5\. Information You Share

Our service includes a number of means by which you may share data with third parties, including, but not limited to, directly within the site, through the generation of content on media sites, such as Facebook or Twitter, and through email or SMS creation and transmission. In all such cases, it is you, rather than SumAll, who is sharing the data, and, as such, you are responsible for any Personal Data that you expose through such sharing.

Be aware of what you are sharing and who you are sharing it with.

## 6\. Anonymous Data

We may create Anonymous Data records from Visitor, Subscriber and Crazy Awesome Data by subjecting it to de-identification through the removal of all personally identifying data (including, but not limited to, names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses) and through the use of generally accepted statistical de-identification techniques.

SumAll may use Anonymous Data, for illustration purposes only, to generate benchmarks and indices as part of our Service, to issue a press release as to the total revenue amount of our U.S. customers, to produce analysis of shopping cart abandonment rates, or to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Services and improve Site navigation. SumAll reserves the right to use Anonymous Data for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties at its sole discretion.

## 7\. Advertising

We partner with a third party ad network to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you with targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by [clicking here](http://preferences.truste.com/2.0/). Please note this does not prevent you from being served non-targeted advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
