  * Information we receive from you on applications and other forms
  * Information about your transactions with us
  * Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency
  * Information we receive from Market Research Companies and websites (including email addresses)



We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, as permitted by law.

**PARTIES WHO RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM US**

We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to the following types of third parties:

  * Financial service providers, such as insurance companies and mortgage service companies
  * Non-financial companies, such as consumer reporting agencies, data processors, check/share draft printers, financial statement publishers/printers, plastic card processors, government agencies and mailhouses



**DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO PARTIES THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO US**

In order for us to conduct the business of the credit union, we may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements, to other companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, or to nonaffiliated third parties for the purposes of processing and servicing transactions that you request or authorize, so that we may provide members competitive products and services.

We may also disclose nonpublic personal information about you under circumstances as permitted or required by law.

These disclosures typically include information to process transactions on your behalf, conduct the operations of our credit union, follow your instructions as you authorize, or protect the security of our financial records.

To protect our members' privacy, we only work with companies that agree to maintain strong confidentialityprotections and limit the use of information we provide. We do not permit these companies to sell the information we provide to other third parties.

**DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ABOUT FORMER MEMBERS**

If you terminate your membership with Summit Credit Union, we will not share information we have collected about you, except as may be permitted or required by law.

**OPT OUT REQUEST**

You may request that we not share personal information with certain non-affiliated third parties. However, your request does not apply to anything that is sent directly from Summit Credit Union, disclosures that are legally required or that are required to perform a service you've requested, or to relationships with affiliated third parties. Please note that while at this time, we have not established any relationship that this opt-out will apply toward, there may be an opportunity in the future that we feel is beneficial for you. An example would be specific benefits for Summit Credit Union members with travel clubs or retail stores.

**JOINT/MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS**

  * If you have a joint account, your opt out applies to every person on the account.
  * If you have multiple accounts with us, you must opt out separately for each account. If you still choose to exercise an opt-out request, call (800) 236-5560, or visit our Website at SummitCreditUnion.com and click on "About Summit" then "Privacy Policy." Once we receive your request, we have a reasonable amount of time to stop the disclosures. You can contact the credit union any time to revoke your opt-out election. If you would like clarification of these conditions, please call or visit our website at SummitCreditUnion.com for a list of "Frequently Asked Questions."



**HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION**

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, or procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.

**WHAT MEMBERS CAN DO TO HELP**

Summit Credit Union is committed to protecting the privacy of its members. Members can help by following these simple guidelines:

  * Protect your account numbers, plastic card numbers, personal identification numbers (PINs) or passwords. Never keep your PIN with your card. The PIN can provide free access to your accounts if your card is lost or stolen.
  * Use caution when disclosing your account numbers, social security numbers, etc. to other persons. If someone calls you explaining the call is on behalf of the credit union and asks for your account number, you should beware. Official credit union staff will have access to your information and will not need to ask for it.
  * Keep your information with us current. If your address or phone number changes, please let us know. It is important that we have current information on how to reach you. If we detect potentially fraudulent or unauthorized activity or use of an account, we will attempt to contact you immediately.
