We collect personal information directly from you when you contact us, register with us, enquire about our activities, make a donation, participate in an event, buy from our online shop, apply to work or volunteer with us, visit our website or otherwise provide us with your personal information.

We may also receive personal information indirectly from you, for example through specialist companies carrying out work on our behalf, such as surveys or event bookings, partner organisations for our projects or website and social media platforms which you use to engage with us.

When you choose to interact with us we may collect the following personal information about you, where we have a lawful reason:

  * contact information: Including name, postal address, email address, phone number, place of work and job title
  * financial information: Including bank details, payment details and if you are a taxpayer
  * background information: Including employment history, eligibility checks and training records
  * sensitive personal information: Including age, gender, health, and other diversity information
  * your opinions on our services and the routes near you
  * how you interact with our website and track which pages you visit when you follow links from our emails through the use of cookies.



Where possible we use anonymous or aggregated data that does not identify you.

#### How do we use personal information?

We use the personal information collected from you for a number of purposes, where we have a lawful reason, including:

  * providing you with services, products or information you have requested
  * providing further relevant information about our work, services, activities or products
  * analysing, managing and improving our services, products and information
  * furthering our charitable aims, including for fundraising activities
  * processing donations or payments we have received from you
  * fulfilling sales you place through our online shop

  * inviting voluntary participation in research or surveys.



We will also process your personal information as required by law or regulation.

#### Do we share your personal information?

We will never sell your personal information to any third parties.

We will share your personal information with partner organisations, such as local authorities or funders, where mentioned when you provide us with your personal information.

In order to deliver the services we offer, we may share your personal information with carefully selected third parties working with us or on our behalf, for example delivery companies for our online shop.

We will share your personal information when legally required to do so.

#### How do we keep your personal information secure?

We adopt appropriate technical and organisational measures to make sure your personal information is secure, and protected against unauthorised or unlawful processing, and accidental loss, destruction or damage, from the point of collection to the point of destruction.

Access to your personal information is restricted to those people who are required and authorised to process it. Appropriate background checks and training take place for our staff, contractors and volunteers processing personal information.  
Your personal information will only be shared with another organisation if they agree to ensure sufficient safeguards are in place to protect your personal information.

We will not transfer personal information to countries outside the European Economic Area unless appropriate safeguards are in place, your individual rights are enforceable with effective legal remedies and you are informed.

#### How long do we keep your personal information?

While you are actively engaged with our work we will retain your personal information. Beyond that, we will generally keep your personal information for up to six years, or as legally required. We will remove your personal information earlier if it is no longer required, we no longer have a lawful basis for processing it, or you ask us to remove it.
