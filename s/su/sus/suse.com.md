  * understand how you use and interact with our products and services;
  * improve our products and services.
  * optimise your html email experience;
  * provide you more relevant content; and

You may reject the collection and processing of data at any time, by changing your browser setting to prevent the storage of cookies. See our Cookie Policy for further details about cookies in general and about Google Analytics cookies specifically.

The Digital River privacy policy is available at <https://www.digitalriver.com/privacy-policy/>.

##### DoubleClick Ad Exchange:

While we do not incorporate code or functionality from DoubleClick, this website uses the online marketing tool DoubleClick by Google. DoubleClick uses cookies to display adverts that are relevant to the user, to improve reports on campaign performance, and to avoid users being shown the same adverts multiple times. Via a cookie ID, Google records which adverts are displayed in which browser and is thus able to prevent the adverts from being shown multiple times. Furthermore, with the aid of cookie IDs, DoubleClick can record conversions relating to ad requests. This is the case, for example, when a user sees a DoubleClick advert and later visits the advertiser’s website using the same browser and makes a purchase on that website. According to Google, DoubleClick cookies contain no personal information.

Through the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Google server. We have no influence on the scope and further use of the data collected through use of this tool by Google and are therefore providing you with information based on what we know: Through the integration of DoubleClick, Google receives the information that you have accessed the relevant section of our website or that you have clicked on one of our adverts. If you are registered with a Google service, Google can link the visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or are not logged in, the provider may learn and store your IP address.

You can prevent participation in this tracking process in a number of ways: a) by configuring your browser software accordingly; in particular, the suppression of third-party cookies means that you will not receive adverts from third-party providers; b) by disabling the cookies for conversion tracking, by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain "googleadservices.com", at <https://www.google.com/settings/ads>; this setting is deleted if you delete your cookies; c) by disabling interest-related adverts from providers who are part of the "About Ads" self-regulation campaign via the link <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>; this setting is deleted if you delete your cookies; d) by permanently deactivating your Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome browser at the link <http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin>. Please note that in this case, you may not be able to use fully all the functions on this website.

The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR. Further information on DoubleClick by Google is available at <https://www.google.com/doubleclick>, and on data protection in general at Google: [ https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy ](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy). Alternatively, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) website at [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). Google has joined the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, [ https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework ](https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework).

We currently use the following social media plug-ins on our website:

  * Facebook
  * Twitter
  * LinkedIn



We use the two-click solution. This means that when you visit our site, no personal data is sent initially to the plug-in providers. You can identify the provider of the plug-in by the marking on the box, via the provider’s initial letters or logo. We give you the opportunity to communicate directly with the plug-in provider via the button. The plug-in provider will receive the information that you have visited the relevant page on our website only if you click on the marked field and thereby activate it. In addition, the data specified in Part 1, Section 3 of this policy will be transmitted. In the case of Facebook and Xing, according to these providers, the IP address is anonymised immediately after being collected in Germany. When the plug-in is activated, your personal data is therefore sent to the relevant plug-in provider and stored there (in the case of US providers, in the USA). Because the plug-in providers carry out data collection using cookies, we recommend deleting all cookies via the security settings in your browser before clicking on the greyed-out box.

We have no influence on the data collected or on the data processing operations, nor do we know the full scope of the data collection, the purposes of the processing or the retention periods. We also have no information regarding the erasure of the collected data by the plug-in providers.

The plug-in provider stores the data collected regarding you as usage profiles and uses these for advertising and market research purposes and/or for ensuring that its website is designed in accordance with requirements. Such use is carried out (including for users who are not logged in) for the purposes of displaying appropriate advertising and informing other users on the social network about your activities on our website. You have a right to object to the creation of these user profiles. To assert this right, you must contact the relevant plug-in provider. Via the plug-ins, we offer you the opportunity to interact with social networks and other users so that we can improve the experience we offer and make it more interesting for you as a user. The legal basis for the use of plug-ins is Art. 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR.

The data transfer takes place irrespective of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged into your account. If you are logged into your account with the plug-in provider, your data collected on our website will be linked directly to this account. If you click on the activated button and e.g. link the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts. We recommend regularly logging out after using a social network, before activating the button, as in this way you can prevent a link being made by the plug-in provider to your profile.

Further information on the purpose and scope of the collection and processing of data by the plug-in provider is available in the privacy policies of these providers listed below. In these privacy policies, you can also find further information on your associated rights and setting options for protecting your privacy.

##### Integration of YouTube videos:

We may integrate YouTube videos in our website. These videos are stored on [http://www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/) and can be played directly from our website. The videos are all integrated in "enhanced data protection mode", meaning that no data regarding you as a user is transmitted to YouTube if you do not play the videos. The data specified in paragraph 2 is transmitted only when you play the videos. We have no influence over this data transmission.

Through the visit to the website, YouTube receives the information that you have accessed the relevant page on our website. In addition, the data specified in Part 1, Section 3 of this policy will be transmitted. This takes place irrespective of whether you have a user account with YouTube that you are logged into or whether no user account exists. If you are logged in on Google, your data will be linked directly to your account. If you do not want your data to be linked to your YouTube profile, you must log out before activating the button. YouTube stores your data as usage profiles and uses it for advertising and market research purposes and/or for ensuring that its website is designed in accordance with requirements. Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (even for users who are not logged in) to provide appropriate advertising and to inform other users on the social network about your activities on our website. You have a right to object to the creation of these user profiles. To assert this right, you must contact YouTube. 

Further information on the purpose and scope of the collection and processing of data by YouTube is available in the privacy policy. Here, you can also find further information on your rights and setting options for protecting your privacy: [ https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy ](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy).
