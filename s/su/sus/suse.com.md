# NOVELL: Privacy Policy

## Novell Online Privacy Policy  
Effective on: 11 Aug 2004

[](https://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.novell.com)

We at Novell value the relationship we have with our customers and web site visitors, and are committed to responsible information handling practices. We take the privacy of our customers very seriously and want you to feel comfortable whenever you visit our web sites, access our online services, or participate in our online offerings. Although our web sites have unique services and offerings, they share a similar privacy philosophy. Therefore, we drafted this corporate online privacy policy to represent Novell's general privacy approach to the information practices of our web sites. In addition to this privacy policy, you can find specific web site privacy statements that provide more detailed information about the web site data handling practices-see links below:

### Novell privacy principles

Our approach to responsible information handling is founded on the basis of the Fair Information Practices, the cornerstone of which is providing notice of our information practices and other privacy aspects in order to allow individuals to make informed decisions regarding personally identifiable information. Furthermore, Novell has adopted leading industry practices as set forth by the [Online Privacy Alliance](http://www.privacyalliance.org/), [Direct Marketing Association](http://www.the-dma.org/), and [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/). As a sponsor and member of TRUSTe, you will see the TRUSTe seal on many of our web sites and on pages that request information from you. You may click through the seals to reach the site privacy policy or validate our privacy certification for that site.

Novell.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact [privacy@novell.com](mailto:privacy@novell.com). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact [TRUSTe](http://truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.

As a licensee of TRUSTe, we have established the following principles that govern our information practices and other privacy aspects of our web sites:

  * We provide you notice of our information practices.
  * We offer you choices regarding how personally identifiable information you provide us may be used.
  * We provide you the opportunity to update or correct the contact information that you have provided us.
  * We protect personally identifiable information.
  * We provide you with means to contact us about our information practices and other privacy aspects.

We also identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request. Whenever we request additional or optional information, we mark those as voluntary so that you know it is not required to provide the requested service.

If we change our information handling practices or other privacy aspects, we will post a prominent notice on our homepage of those changes to this privacy statement, at least 30 days prior to their the implementation. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner.

When you provide personally identifiable information to us that may be used for secondary purposes (i.e., uses not related to the purpose for which the information was collected), we give you the opportunity to opt-out of such uses.

### We strive to provide you the opportunity to update or correct the contact information that you have provided to us

We have a variety of mechanisms for you to modify and update the contact information that you have provided to us and are in the process of developing more mechanisms to update your personal data.
