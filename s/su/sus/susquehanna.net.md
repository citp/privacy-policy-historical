  * financial service providers such as banks, a registered investment advisor, a mortgage company, a securities broker-dealer, a trust company, insurance agencies, and an automobile leasing company.

**Service Providers/Joint Marketing Partners**   
In order to provide you with valuable financial products or services, we may share with businesses outside of our corporate family both Transactional Information and Credit Report Information. These businesses will be performing marketing and other services on our behalf. We also may share this information with other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements.
