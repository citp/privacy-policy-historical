Your privacy is very important to us and we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users (" **users** ," " **you** " or " **your** "). Although SustainableCircles respects your privacy, we do collect information from you. This Privacy Policy along with our Terms of Use ([www.sustainlane.com/sp/help/terms-use.jsp](http://www.sustainlane.com/sp/help/terms-use.jsp)) govern your interaction with our Sites, and your registration for and use of our Sites. Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use and other published guidelines, we do not release personally identifiable information about our users without their permission.

**1.** ******Introduction**

While you may use some of the functionality of our Sites without registration, some of the specific tools and services might require registration. If you do not register with or use the tools, features or services offered on or through our Sites, the only information we collect will be "Non-Personal Information" (i.e., Information that is not traceable back to you and cannot be used to identify you. Non-Personal Information includes information such as the web pages that you have viewed.) through the use of Cookies (i.e., Small data files that are stored on the hard drive of a computer used to view web sites that are accessible only by the party or site that placed the Cookie on the hard drive.). If registration is required and you choose to register through our Sites, we will require you to submit "Personally Identifiable Information" (i.e., Information that can be traced back to you. Personally Identifiable Information includes information such as your name, home address, telephone number and email address). You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to SustainableCircles.

**2.** ******Consent**

BY SUBMITTING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO US, AND/OR BY USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY COLLECT, USE AND DISCLOSE SUCH PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF USE, AND AS PERMITTED OR REQUIRED BY LAW.

We also operate the SustainLane Green Ad Network, a service that delivers advertisements from participating advertisers to participating publishers. We use third parties to assist with various functions and features of the SustainLane Green Ad Network.  For example, we use services provided by third parties for the targeted and measured delivery of ads to publisher sites based on criteria selected by such publishers and the advertisers and agencies advertising on such websites.  These services use tags (web beacons, programming code or HTML that request the delivery of an ad) and technology designed to enable the capture and reporting of post-impression and/or post-click visitor activity.  Because these activities occur on publisher sites and not on our Sites, this Privacy Policy does not apply to publisher sites that participate in the SustainLane Green Ad Network.  You are encouraged to review the privacy policies applicable to publisher sites for more information about their privacy practices.
