## Overview

The University of Sussex is registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Our registration reference is Z6428144.

You can refer to the University’s [Data Protection Policy](https://web.archive.org/ogs/policies/information/dpa) for more information about our commitment to processing personal data in a way that is compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation.

The Data Protection Officer for the University of Sussex is Alexandra Elliott, Head of Information Management and Compliance. If you have any queries concerning your personal data and how it is processed, contact the Data Protection Officer at [dpo@sussex.ac.uk](mailto:dpo@sussex.ac.uk).

## The basis for processing your personal data

We process personal information to enable us to provide education and support services to our students and staff; advertising and promoting the University and the services we offer; publication of the University magazine and alumni relations, undertaking research and fundraising; managing our accounts and records and providing commercial activities to our clients.

We also process personal information via the use of CCTV systems to monitor and collect visual images for the purposes of security and the prevention and detection of crime, for disciplinary proceedings against staff and students, for monitoring security and for assisting in traffic management and parking enforcement.

We will collect and process personal data about you for the purposes described above. Personal data may include “ _special categories of data_ ” as described under the General Data Protection Regulation, such as information about your racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs or other beliefs, and physical or mental health.

When we process personal data, there needs to be a legal basis for doing so and, if we process special categories of data, we need to meet additional conditions too. Further information can be found on the [ICO’s website](http://www.ico.org.uk/).

The University processes personal data largely on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of our tasks carried out in the public interest or because it is necessary for our or a third party’s legitimate interests. The purpose of the University is to advance learning and knowledge by teaching and research to the benefit of the wider community and examples of processing on this basis include monitoring and evaluating the performance and effectiveness of the University and improving the academic, corporate, financial and human resource management of the University.

We may also process your personal data because it is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering a contact. For example, this may include interacting with individuals before they are enrolled as a student, as part of the admissions process, or dealing with any concerns a student may have.

We may also need to process personal data to comply with our legal obligations. This can include compliance and regulatory obligations, such as anti-money laundering laws, immigration obligations and safeguarding requirements, or to assist with investigations carried out by the police or other authorities. We may also process your personal data where it is necessary to protect your or another person’s vital interests, or in circumstances where we have your specific consent to do so.
