We hope that you will find everything you need to know about how we protect your personal data and what uses we make of it below.

#### Personal Information: What we Collect and Why

We only ask you for the information we need to allow you to use a particular function of the site. This includes your name and email address when adding a comment or rating a part of the site.

Your data is processed by our main web partners and our Real Rewards partners. Each of these partners is committed to protecting your data in line with the rigorous demands we place on them.

We may use and share non-personal information, as it relates to sets or groups of customers, to enhance our understanding of customer behaviour and enable us to improve our service in general.
