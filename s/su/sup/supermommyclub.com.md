# Privacy Policy

## How we use your personal information

Your information will be held by Just Bright Ideas.

This privacy notice is to let you know how we promise to look after your personal information. This includes what you tell us about yourself, what we learn by having you as a reader, and the choices you give us about what marketing you want us to send you.

This notice also tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

Last updated: May 4, 2018.

### Our Privacy Promise

We promise:

  * To keep your data safe and private.
  * Not to sell your data.
  * To give you ways to manage and review your marketing choices at any time.



## How the law protects you

This section sets out the legal reasons we rely on, for each of the ways we may use your personal information.

As well as our Privacy Promise, your privacy is protected by law. This section explains how that works.

Data Protection law says that we are allowed to use personal information only if we have a proper reason to do so. This includes sharing it with third parties. The law says we must have one or more of these reasons:

  * To fulfil a contract we have with you, or
  * When it is our legal duty, or
  * When it is in our legitimate interest, or
  * When you consent to it.



When we have a business reason of our own to use your information, this is called a ‘legitimate interest’. We will tell you what that is, if we are going to rely on it as the reason for using your data. Even then, it must not unfairly go against your interests.
