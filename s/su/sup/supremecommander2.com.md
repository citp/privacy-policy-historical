*  **The Types of Information We Collect from You and How We Collect It**

From the moment you begin interacting with the Services we are collecting information. This information includes information that identifies or can be used to identify you personally.

**Information You Disclose Publicly** : The Services may permit you to submit content on various public channels like blogs and message boards, as well as through gameplay. We or others may store, display, publish, or otherwise use this content in perpetuity, and may or may not attribute it to you. Please note that we do not control who will have access to information you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. Please think carefully before sharing any information on the Services.

**Information Third Parties Provide about You** :We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Services with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor content and ads to you, and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you.

**Third-Party Logins** : The Services may include the option to register or log in to an account using Facebook, Google, or another third-party service. By doing so, you provide us with access to certain information from your social media profile, such as your name, email address, photo, gender, birthday, location, friends, people you follow/who follow you, content you post, or likes you make. We use this information to do things like give you exclusive content, personalize your experience on the Services, or advertise to you online, and you consent to the use of this information in accordance with this Privacy Notice. Please be aware that these third parties are not subject to this Privacy Notice, and we are not responsible for their practices. You should review the applicable third parties’ privacy policies before using their tools to interact with the Services.

**Tracking Technologies** : We use various technologies to collect information from you, including as follows:

  * **Log Files**. A log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your use of the Services.
  * **Cookies:**  A cookie is a data file placed on your device when you visit the Services. Cookies may be used for many purposes, such as remembering you and your preferences, supporting our security features, and tracking your visits to and activities on and off the Services, including for purposes of bringing you relevant advertising. Some features of the Services may not function properly if you choose to disable cookies, and some types of cookies may not be disabled using browsers. In some instances, especially with respect to mobile, we may require you to uninstall/not use the Services rather than have a poor experience from disabling cookies. Please review our [Square Enix, Inc. Cookie Policy](https://na.square-enix.com/us/documents/cookies) for more information.
  * **Embedded Scripts:**  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third-party service provider is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
  * **Pixels:**  A pixel (also known as a web beacon) is code embedded in a website, video, email, or advertisement that sends information about your usage to a server. When you access a website, video, email, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a third party to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We may incorporate pixels from third parties that allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Services, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Services with your social media account.
  * **ETag, or entity tag:**  A feature of the cache in browsers, an ETag is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and HTML5 cookies.
  * **Location-Identifying Technologies:  **GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies may be used to collect precise location data when you enable location-based services through your device.
  * **App Technologies:**  There are a variety of technologies that may be included in our apps that are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. For example, our apps may include third party SDKs, which is code that sends information about your usage to a server. These SDKs allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Services, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Services with your social media account.



As noted above, third parties may also use these or other tracking technologies with our Services. We do not control those third-party tracking technologies and you should visit those third parties’ websites for information about their privacy practices.

*  **Third Parties with Whom We Share Your Information**

We use various third parties to help support and operate the Services or perform certain functions on our behalf. If we share your information with these third parties, we will only provide them with information they reasonably need to perform their specific services for the purposes we specify in our contract with them, although we may permit them to use information that does not identify you for other purposes. If we stop using their services, we will require that any of your information that they hold be securely and permanently deleted or de-identified so that it does not identify you. In all cases, we will apply measures to help keep your data safe and your privacy protected.

Here are some examples of the types of third parties with which we may share your information:

  * information technology companies who support our websites and other business systems;
  * direct marketing companies who help us manage our electronic communications with you;
  * ad partners like Google and Facebook, so that they can show you products that might interest you;

**Third-Party Locations and Services** : When you are on the Services, you may be directed to other sites or services that are operated by third parties outside of our control. For example, if you click on a link displayed on the Services you may be taken off the Services to a different site. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by these third parties. We encourage you to pay attention when you leave our Services and to review the privacy policies of any third-party locations you go to.

**Administrative and Legal Disclosures** : We disclose your information to third parties: (i) in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; (ii) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, or governmental requestor legal process, or any legal process in connection with a court proceeding or arbitration, if in our good faith opinion we are required or permitted to do so by law; (iii) to investigate potential violations of the [SEA Terms of Service](https://na.square-enix.com/us/documents/tnc) or other policies applicable to the Services; (iv) to protect the safety, rights, property or security of the Services, our staff, users, or any other third party; or (v) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or threats to security.

*  **Third-Party Ads and Analytics**

The Services may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve targeted advertisements on and off the Services based on your behavior on and off of the Services, and may use third-party analytics, user research, or other similar service providers to evaluate and provide us or other third parties with information about your use of the Services and viewing of ads or content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your visits to the Services and other locations you have visited.

Third-party ad serving enables us and others to target advertisements to you or people like you for products and services in which you or people like you might be interested. For example, if you provide us with your email address we may share it with Facebook so that you can receive targeted ads from us when you use Facebook, and so that other users of Facebook who share similar interests to you can also receive targeted ads from us. The Services’ third-party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your device and browser. These third-party tracking technologies may be set to, among other things, help deliver relevant advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, or help understand the usefulness of these advertisements to you. Our representations regarding our practices in this Privacy Notice do not extend to the practices of these third-party advertisers and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect. By installing and using our Services, you consent to these practices, including the sharing of data about you with these third parties and their own collection of such data.

Please note that we adhere to the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising](http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/sites/digital.daaoperations.org/files/DAA_files/seven-principles-07-01-09.pdf).

**Limit the Information You Provide to Us** : You can stop all prospective collection of information on our Services by uninstalling and ceasing to use or interact with the Services. You can also decline to provide us with any information we request from you, although please note that this may mean you are not able to use certain parts of the Services ( _e.g._ , you will not be able to create an account with us if you do not provide your email address and other information we need to process your registration). With respect to our mobile applications, you may use the standard uninstall process supported by your device, the app, or the marketplace or software through which you acquired the app to stop all prospective information collection through the app.

**Change Your Communications Preferences** : You may cancel or modify the email communications you receive from us by following the instructions contained within our promotional emails or, where applicable, by logging into an account you have created for our Services and adjusting your settings. This will not affect subsequent access to the Services.

We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
