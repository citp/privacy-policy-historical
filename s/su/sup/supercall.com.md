## Information We Collect and Use:

When we refer to “ **Personal Data** ,” we mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“ **data subject** ”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier.

We also collect general information (“ **Usage Data** ”) regarding your use of the Services. This Usage Data can refer to personal identifiers (such as IP address and device identifiers), demographic information, information about preferences, interests, search queries, and online activity (such as date and time of your access to the Services, referring URLs, and information about the usage of our Services). When Usage Data includes Personal Data, we treat the Personal Data as described by this Privacy Policy.

We directly and through third-parties collect information that you provide to us, from your use of the Services, and from other sources. The information that we collect and how we process it depends on how you use and access the Services and we combine all of the information we have about you so that we can analyze it and provide better Services to you. We collect information, including Personal Data, as follows:

_Your Submissions to Us._   Personal Data will be collected when you sign up for an online newsletter or contact us with a question or request.  For example, if you submit a request to advertise with us, you may provide us with your personal identifiers (such as your name, email address, telephone number, and address), and professional and employment information (such as your company name).  We use this information as necessary to respond to your request or inquiry and to provide and improve the Services and our products and services. We process this Personal Data as long as we have a legitimate interest or based on your consent.

Such information will include the location of the mobile device or computer used to access the Services derived from GPS or WiFi use, calculated based on your device’s IP Address, or the geographic information you provide to us (e.g., your city). We use this information to analyze the use of the Services, customize and improve the content for you on the Services, send you location-specific content, and show you events or businesses near you. We use and retain the Personal Data for as long as necessary and useful to provide personalized and improved services to you or until you withdraw consent.  

_Your Social Media Interactions._   We receive Personal Data about you when you interact with us using the social media aspects to our Services (such as comment plug-ins), on our social media pages and channels, or on other channels and content.  The Personal Data includes personal identifiers (such as your profile name and profile identifier) and the content of your submissions. We use this information to communicate with you and for internal analysis of visitors and content.  We use and retain your Personal Data for these purposes until you withdraw consent or we do not use the social media pages anymore. Please review the privacy policies and settings of any websites, mobile applications, or social networks should you have any questions about their privacy practices.  

Please bear in mind that any content (e.g., comments, photographs, information and other materials) that you post directly on our Services, including our social media pages, is public and can be read, collected or used by others.  Please be cautious when disclosing any Personal Data through public activities or submissions.

Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before the withdrawal. We may also notify you periodically about important changes to the Services (such as a material changes to this Privacy Policy or notice of a security breach). Withdrawing consent from marketing communications does not affect our ability to send you these communications, such as those related to providing services to you or responding to your requests. 

You may opt out from receiving marketing-related communications by either clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of marketing-related emails we send you or by contacting us at [compliance@groupninemedia.com](mailto:compliance@groupninemedia.com). We will process opt-out requests without undue delay.

_Events, Contests and Sweepstakes._   We request Personal Data, such as your personal identifiers (name and email address) and personal characteristics (such as date of birth) when you choose to participate in an event, contest, or sweepstakes.  We use this information to determine eligibility, process your registration or entry, enforce the terms of the event, contest, or sweepstakes, and contact you about the event, contests, and sweepstakes you are participating in. We may also disclose the Personal Data to third parties or the public in connection with the event, contest, or sweepstakes, such as for winner selection and announcements and prize fulfillment, as stated in the official rules, and as otherwise required by law.  We will retain your Personal Data for as long as this is necessary to conduct the contest, i.e. until all prizes have ultimately been distributed and possible accordant time limits for legal actions have lapsed.

_Your Employment Applications._   You may submit Personal Data to us through our career pages when you express interest in or apply for employment.  We may receive your personal identifiers (such as name, email address, and telephone number) and professional, employment, and education information in your resume/CV and cover letter to us.  You may also submit Personal Data to us using your social media account, such as LinkedIn. When you do this, we receive the Personal Data you permit LinkedIn to share with us based on your LinkedIn settings, such as your personal identifiers (including your email address and telephone number).  We also receive your work experience, education, skills, and recommendation information. We use such information as a necessity to respond to your inquiry and contact you about employment and thus in preparation for the performance of a contract with you. If your application is successful, we retain the Personal Data for the duration of your employment with us, and beyond based on statutory retention periods. If we do not employ you we will delete your Personal Data when accordant time limits for legal actions have lapsed. For the purposes of this paragraph, “we” and “us” includes POPSUGAR.

_Automatic Usage Data Collection through Cookies and Similar Technologies._   With your consent or as otherwise permitted by law, when you visit the Services (including our social media pages and channels) or open our emails, we and our service providers and trusted third parties, such as advertising networks, social media widgets, affiliate partners, and analytics providers, collect certain information, including Personal Data, by automated means, such as cookies, web beacons and web server logs. The information collected in this manner includes Usage Data, identifiers (IP address and device identifiers), and device characteristics (including browser characteristics, operating system version, language preferences). We use this information, for example, to determine how many users have visited certain website and social media pages, social media channels,  or opened messages or newsletters, to evaluate, improve, and provide the content we send you, evaluate and improve how the Services function, provide you with personalized content and advertising on and off the Services and in email, and to prevent fraud. Our [Cookie Policy](https://www.groupninemedia.com/cookie-policy) provides more information about our use of cookies and the retention of your Personal Data collected via cookies.  

We may link this data with other information we have collected from and about you.  Our service providers and trusted third parties also may collect and combine information collected on our Services and emails with other information about your online activities over time, on other devices, and on other websites or apps, if those websites and apps also use the same vendors.  Our service providers use the information only to provide their services to us. The trusted third parties use the information they collect according to their privacy policies and may use it for their own business and commercial purposes. You cannot opt out of service providers collecting and using this information, but you may opt out of certain third parties collecting this information directly from you and using the data for their own business purposes [here](http://www.groupninemedia.com/ccpa). For example, we currently use Google Analytics to collect and process certain website usage data for the above purposes and to facilitate our use of other Google tools (e.g., Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting).  To learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out, please visit [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).  You may be able to change browser settings to block and delete cookies when you access the Services through a web browser.  However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly. The Services do not respond to browser do-not-track signals, but they do respond to browser cookie settings. You can learn how to decline or opt-out of cookies by reading our [Cookie Policy](https://www.groupninemedia.com/cookie-policy).  You may also learn more about our online advertising practices in the Online Advertising section below.

The processing of your Personal Data for this purpose is based on your consent or necessity to provide the Services to you. We retain the information as described below in this Privacy Policy.

_Pseudonymization and Anonymization_.  In some circumstances we pseudonymize and/or anonymize your Personal Data for business purposes including to improve our products and services, in which case we use such information without further notice to you.  The processing of your Personal Data for this purpose is based on our legitimate interests to provide better products and services. We retain the Personal Data for as long as they are necessary and useful to improve our products and services.

_Legal and Other Similar Uses._ We process information, including your Personal Data, if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; respond to your requests; comply with the law; enforce our Terms and Conditions; or protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety. This processing is based on our legitimate interests in legal protection of our and others’ rights. We retain the Personal Data for as long as allowed or required by statutory laws.

## Online Advertising:

We use industry standard website tracking and delivery technology to serve you relevant advertising on and off the Services.  With your consent, our Services display advertisements to you via targeted advertising methods. This permits us to show you certain advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests based on information we receive from visitors of the Services and by third parties. You may also see certain ads though your use of the Services because we participate in advertising networks.  We have selected ad networks to allow us to target our advertising to users through the use of click-stream, demographic, behavioral and contextual information. The use of third party tracking technologies to collect this information is often subject to their own privacy policies.

Our [Cookie Policy](https://www.groupninemedia.com/cookie-policy) provides more information about our use of cookies for tracking usage of the Services. You may opt-out of the collection of Personal Data on the Services by certain of these trusted third parties by going [here](http://www.groupninemedia.com/ccpa).

Our Services may also contain links to other third party websites that we do not control. These third parties may collect information about you through the use of their own cookies and web beacons, may independently collect data or solicit Personal Data, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third party.

You cannot opt-out of this sharing.

## Where Personal Data Is Used and Stored:

We operate the services in the United States.  Therefore, if you provide us with Personal Data during your use of the Services, we collect, process, and store that information in the United States.  We may also transfer that information to our affiliates and subsidiaries or to other third parties, across borders to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are visiting from the European Economic Area or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you may be transferring your Personal Data to the United States, which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU or other countries. 

We maintain appropriate safeguards to properly protect Personal Data concerning you when it is transferred to the United States.  These safeguards are set forth in internal policies that include EU-approved standard contractual clauses that include EU-equivalent data subject rights and remedies. For more information about our data transfer safeguards, please send a request to [compliance@groupninemedia.com](mailto:compliance@groupninemedia.com).  

## Privacy Rights:

Certain jurisdictions have specific legal requirements and grant privacy rights with respect to Personal Data, and we will comply with restrictions and any requests you submit as required by applicable law. For example, you may have the right to review, correct, and delete Personal Data we have about you, or to consent or withdraw consent to certain uses or sharing of Personal Data. You may be able to use the Services to access and update the information that you have provided to us.

When you make a request, we may require that you provide information and follow procedures so that we can verify a request you make and your jurisdiction before responding to it. The verification steps we take may differ depending on your jurisdiction and the request. We will match the information that you provide in your request to information we already have on file to verify your identity. If we are able to verify your request, we will process it. If we cannot verify your request, we may ask you for additional information to help us verify your request.

We will respond to your request within the time period required by applicable law. However, we may not always be able to fully comply with your request, and we will notify you in that event.

_California Notice and Privacy Rights_

As stated elsewhere in this privacy policy, we do not share Personal Data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, as defined by California Civil Code Section 1798.83, unless we give you choice (opt-in or opt-out) before sharing with those third parties.

If you are a California resident, you may be entitled to additional rights with respect to your personal information pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). For more information about these rights and how to exercise them, please see our California Privacy Notice [here](http://www.groupninemedia.com/ccpa), which is hereby incorporated by reference into this Privacy Policy.

_EU Notice and Rights_

While we take various steps to ensure the accuracy and completeness of your Personal Data, we rely upon you to provide accurate and complete Personal Data when interacting with us. You may also have the legal right, for example if you are using the Services from the EU, to request: 

  * Obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not we process Personal Data from you and, where that is the case, access to your Personal Data;
  * Rectification of inaccurate Personal Data;
  * Erasure of Personal Data;
  * Objection to the processing of Personal Data;
  * Restriction of processing of Personal Data; and 
  * Portability of Personal Data - receive the Personal Data you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable form and transmit those data it to another entity. 



Also, where our processing of your Personal Data is based on your consent, you may withdraw consent at any time for the future. Please note that withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before the withdrawal.  

Any such requests should be submitted by email to [compliance@groupninemedia.com](mailto:compliance@groupninemedia.com). 

Please see for additional information: <https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rights-citizens_en>. 

If you are using the Services from the EU, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with an EU supervisory authority if you do not think we are handling your Personal Data in compliance with applicable law. However, if you have a complaint regarding the processing of your Personal Data we kindly request that you first contact us directly by sending us an email at [compliance@groupninemedia.com](mailto:compliance@groupninemedia.com), and we will reply promptly.

## How Long We Keep Your Personal Data:

We consider several factors to determine how long we keep Personal Data.  We consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. Once we no longer have a need for your Personal Data, we will securely destroy it in accordance with our standards and applicable laws and regulations.

We will attempt to honor requests to delete your Personal Data, but please note that we may be required to keep such information for legal purposes and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives. We may also retain your information for fraud or similar purposes.

## How We Protect Personal Data:

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to assist us in protecting the Personal Data we collect against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. We also limit access to Personal Data about you to employees or service providers who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that Personal Data to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.

While we implement these and other security measures on our Services, please note that 100% security is not always possible.  We cannot guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard Personal Data will never be defeated or fail, or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective.

## Children’s Privacy:

We especially care about the privacy of young children.  Accordingly, we do not direct our websites to children under the age of sixteen or knowingly collect Personal Data from them.  If we learn that a user is under sixteen years of age, we will promptly delete any Personal Data that the individual has provided to us.

## Enforcement and More Information

When GNM receives formal written inquiries or complaints, GNM will contact the individual regarding his/her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the handling of Personal Data that cannot be resolved between GNM and an individual.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy:

Without prejudice to your rights under applicable law, this Privacy Policy may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our Personal Data practices. We will notify you of changes to our Privacy Policy in advance by posting the new Privacy Policy here and updating the “Last Updated” date above.
