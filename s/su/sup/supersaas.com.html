<h1>SuperSaaS Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
	At SuperSaaS we recognize that privacy is important.
	This Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by SuperSaaS.
	If you have any questions about this Policy, please feel free to contact us through the <a href="/info/feedback">feedback form</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Last Updated: February 2011</strong></p>
<h2>Information we collect and how we use it</h2>
<p>We offer a number of services for which users of your applications do not require to register or provide any personal information to us, such as the SuperSaaS Scheduler. In
	order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Information you provide</strong> –
		When you sign up for a SuperSaaS account or other SuperSaaS service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for
		personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password).
		We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other SuperSaaS services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services.
		For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.
		For our premium accounts, we use a payment provider who will store your payment account information on their secure servers.
		This information is not shared or combined with others.
	</li>
	<li><strong>SuperSaaS cookies</strong> –
		When you visit SuperSaaS, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer that uniquely
		identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking visitor trends. Most browsers are initially set up to accept
		cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some SuperSaaS features and services may not function
		properly if your cookies are disabled. Some pages on the free service will also send cookies from third parties to aid in serving advertisements.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Log information</strong> –
		When you use SuperSaaS services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you use a web application.
		These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more
		cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
	</li>
	<li><strong>User communications</strong> –
		When you send email or other communication to SuperSaaS, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Other sites</strong> –
		This Privacy Policy applies to SuperSaaS services only. We do not exercise control over the sites who provide SuperSaaS services as part of their own offering.
		These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>SuperSaaS processes personal information for the purposes described above, and in addition to the above we use the information to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Providing our products and services to users, including the display of customized content and advertising</li>
	<li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services</li>
	<li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network</li>
	<li>Developing new services</li>
</ul>
<p>SuperSaaS processes personal information and appointment and booking data on our servers in the Netherlands and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own
	country but we do not process information on servers outside the European Union.
	We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a
	third party, such as our advertising partners.</p>
<h2>Third-Party advertisements on the free version</h2>
<p>If you use the free version of SuperSaaS then we use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not
	including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of
	interest to you.</p>
<h2>Choices for personal information </h2>
<p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the
	purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. </p>
<p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you an effective way
	to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Policy
	and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. </p>
<p>You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case SuperSaaS may not be able to provide those services to you. </p>
<h2>Information sharing</h2>
<p>SuperSaaS only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of SuperSaaS in the following limited circumstances: </p>
<ul>
	<li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</li>
	<li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf.
		We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and
		security measures.
	</li>
	<li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal
		process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise
		address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of SuperSaaS, its users or the public as required or
		permitted by law.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>If SuperSaaS becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and
	becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not
	identify you individually.</p>
<h2>Information security</h2>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. We restrict access to personal
	information to SuperSaaS employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by
	confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, if they fail to meet these obligations. </p>
<h2>Data integrity</h2>
<p>SuperSaaS processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice.
	We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our
	services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their
	personal information whenever necessary.</p>
<h2>Accessing and updating personal information</h2>
<p>When you use SuperSaaS services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to
	delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the
	information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic,
	require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup
	tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so
	would require a disproportionate effort.</p>
<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such
	changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for
	certain services, email notification of Policy changes). Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date.</p>
