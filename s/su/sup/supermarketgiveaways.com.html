  <strong>We respect and protect your privacy.</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8.85pt;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">This Privacy Policy explains our policy regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. This policy may change, so please refer back to it periodically. By accessing </span><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">SuperMarketGiveaways.com&nbsp; (together with all sites owned or operated by SuperMarketGiveaways, collectively called the "Site")</span><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; "> or using our services, you consent to our information practices set forth in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; "> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">How We Collect And Use Information:</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; "> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal;"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">This Policy describes how we store and use the information you give us. Our registration form requests that you provide certain personal information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you, specifically your name, e-mail address, telephone number, postal delivery address, profession, as well as other information when such information is combined with your personal information. We may use, sell or distribute certain individual personal information to other companies, including related interests or vendors so as to provide you with important offers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">When you register for any of our services, we ask you to provide us with personal information so that we can provide and personalize our services and marketing efforts. We use this personal information to process your registration, create your profile and to communicate with you regarding our service. Because email is an integral part of our services, your signup ensures that you'll receive information relative to your interests at the time of your enrollment, from both SuperMarketGiveaways and its partners. If you later wish to cease participation in this portion of our services, you may do so at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link to be found in all of our marketing emails, or you can submit your unsubscribe request at </span><a href="http://supermarketgiveaways.com/unsub.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; ">http://supermarketgiveaways.com/unsub.php</span></a><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Please note that opting not to receive email does not exempt you from receiving administrative emails, which include but are not limited to, notices about membership status changes and alterations to our User Agreement.</span><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; "> </span></p>

Right to Sell/License Data: This Privacy Policy applies to consumers that have signed up on the SuperMarketGiveaways website, and/ or have submitted their email address through our affiliate network program and other co-marketing partnerships to promote our site. We may use the personal information that you supply to us and work with other third party businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members via direct mail, email, SMS text messaging, and telemarketing. These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation and email marketing. Part of our business model involves sharing personally identifiable information, such as name and address, with third-party marketing concerns. While we cannot control the practices of our advertisers and third-party marketers, we endeavor at all times to do business with reputable partners who also follow a best practices model regarding your privacy. All information provided to us by the users of this site may be used to support our suppression, validation and enhancement services to other marketing companies, advertising agencies, compilers and data companies. As an example, opt-out information may be shared with other marketing partners so that those users opting out of further offers are suppressed from the partner’s mailings or promotions, as well as our own. In addition to complying with our users’ preferences, it simply makes good business sense to mail only to those customers who have indicated a desire to receive such mailings.

SMS, Wireless and Other Mobile Offerings: This website, websites linking to this website, and websites linked from this website (collectively "We") may make available a service either directly or through third parties by which you can receive messages on your wireless device via short message service ("SMS Service"). Your provider's standard data and messaging rates apply to all SMS correspondence. All charges are billed by and payable to your mobile service provider. You represent that you are 18 years of age and the owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which messages will be received, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges. Data obtained from you in connection with this SMS Service may include your name, address, cell phone number, your provider's name, and the date, time, and content of your messages. The use of this information will be in accordance with this Mobile Policy. If fees are charged to your wireless account invoice, we may provide your carrier with your applicable information in connection therewith. Your wireless carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own policies. You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over complex networks. We will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any SMS messages, as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your network operator. SMS message services are provided on an AS IS basis. We do not guarantee that your use of the SMS Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the SMS Service. You may opt out of the SMS Service at any time by replying "STOP", "END", or "QUIT" to the SMS text message you have received. This process impacts only the future delivery of the particular SMS message offering, so you must send that message for each offering.
