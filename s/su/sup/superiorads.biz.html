		  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I. INFORMATION COLLECTED</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We collect non-personally  identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your  activities through your IP address, computer settings or most-recently visited  URL.&nbsp; Personally  identifiable information is personal information about you including your name,  address, e-mail address, or phone number, and that which is not otherwise  publicly available. We may also ask you to provide certain  non-personally identifiable information about yourself, such as your age,  household income, buying preferences, etc. Personally identifiable information  about you is collected when you voluntarily submit such information to us, by,  for example, filling out a survey or registration form. We may combine personal  information collected from you with information from other Company services or  third parties to provide a better user experience, including customizing  content for you. &nbsp;</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">II. USE OF INFORMATION</font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In general, we will only use  the information you provide to us for the purpose for which such information  was provided.&nbsp; We may also use this  information to deliver to you information about our company and promotional  material from some of our partners and affiliates, trend analysis, pattern  detection, and site administration.&nbsp; Your  information may also be used to contact you when necessary and may be shared  with other companies that may want to contact you with offers consistent with  your stated preferences.&nbsp; Users may  opt-out of receiving future mailings from Company and other entities by  following the instructions set forth in the opt-out section below.<br>
  Non-personal demographic and profile data is used to  tailor your experience at our site, showing you content we think you might be  interested in.&nbsp; This information may also  be shared with advertisers on an aggregate non-personal basis. We may also  share information with third parties in limited circumstances, including when  complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring  the security of our network and services. <br>
	      The Company may also disclose your information upon a  transfer or sale to another entity of the Company or upon any other corporate  reorganization. </font></p>
		  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">III. USE OF IP ADDRESSES</font></p>
