	<h2>Privacy Agreement</h2>
  <p>
  SupportChoice  is sensitive to your concerns about how we use the personal information we  collect from you through SupportChoice's website (the "Site"). SupportChoice  takes your privacy seriously, and has implemented this privacy policy (the  "Privacy Policy") and internal policies and practices to keep your  personal and financial information secure. The Privacy Policy covers SupportChoice's  treatment of the Personally Identifiable Information we collect when you are on  the Site and when you use SupportChoice services. This Privacy Policy is  incorporated into <a href="/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>, and therefore governs  your use of the Site and SupportChoice services. By visiting the Site or using SupportChoice  services, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or  concerns about the Privacy Policy, please contact Customer Care at info@supportchoice.com.
  </p>
  <h3>What Information Do We Collect  About Our Customers?</h3>
  <p>
  <b>Traffic Data. </b>SupportChoice uses a number of  internal and third-party methods to recognize visitor data like IP addresses  and browser settings (collectively "Visitor Data"). The SupportChoice  internal servers and software automatically recognize Visitor Data. No  Personally Identifiable Information is revealed in this process. The Site may  use Visitor Data to compile traffic data about the types of visitors who use  the Site at specific intervals (collectively "Traffic Data").
  </p>
  <p>
  SupportChoice  may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and  third-party providers, or employ internally developed cookies and tracking  codes, that allow SupportChoice to store a small piece of data on a visitor's  computer about his or her visit to the Site. SupportChoice does not capture  Personally Identifiable Information in cookies or use cookies to mine  Personally Identifiable Information.<br>
  We  may use Traffic Data to analyze Site traffic, but this information is not  examined for Personally Identifiable Information.
  </p>
  <p>
  We may also use Traffic Data  to diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, or display content  according to your preferences. Visitor Data and Traffic Data may also be shared  with business partners, affiliates, or advertisers on an aggregated and  anonymous basis.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Personal Information.</b> SupportChoice requires each  customer to provide us with personal information (collectively "Personally  Identifiable Information") to access and use SupportChoice products and  services. Personally Identifiable Information is captured only when a visitor  accesses the Site, or speaks on the phone with a SupportChoice employee, and  willingly discloses that information. This disclosure may occur when a visitor  registers with the Site, engages in transactions, contacts customer service, or  participates in contests, promotions, surveys, forums, content submissions,  chats, bulletin boards, discussion groups, requests for suggestions, or other  aspects of services offered by SupportChoice.
  </p>
  <p>
  Personally  Identifiable Information includes: (i) "Contact Data" (such as your  name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number, and email address); (ii)  "Financial Data" (such as your credit card number, expiration date, and  verification code); and (iii) "Demographic Data" (such as your zip  code and sex).
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Calls/Electronic Communications.</b> In the  regular course of our business, SupportChoice may monitor and record phone  conversations or email communications between you and SupportChoice employees  for training and quality assurance purposes. We may receive a confirmation when  you open or click on content in an email from us, which helps us make our  communications to you more useful and interesting. If you do not wish to receive  email from SupportChoice, you may unsubscribe from our mailing list on any of  the emails we send.
  </p>
  <h3>How Do We Use the Information We  Collect and Do We Share the Information We Receive?</h3>
  <p>
  We  use information we collect from the Site to communicate with you, fulfill  service agreements, facilitate your transactions with our third-party marketing  partners, and inform you of offers and discounts. For example, you may receive  a welcome email that confirms your username and password, and later receive  communications responding to your inquiries, providing services you request,  and managing your account. We occasionally send service-related announcements,  for example, to alert you if we need to temporarily suspend the Site for  maintenance. We may send promotional emails from time to time. Generally, you  may not opt-out of service-related communications, which are not promotional.  If you do not wish to receive service-related communications, you may terminate  your account by telephone or email. However, you can opt-out of promotional  communications by following the unsubscribe instructions in any communication  or by emailing us at info@supportchoice.com.
  </p>
  <p>
  We  share customer information with third parties only as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Use of Personal Information.</b> SupportChoice, sometimes with  the assistance of a third party or SupportChoice subsidiary, may use your  Personally Identifiable Information to process your payment through merchant  account services, to generate the products and services you order, and to  analyze our customer demographics. Your Contact Data may be used to follow up  with you on transactions you initiate on the Site, respond to inquiries made  through the Site, inform you of changes to the Site, and send you additional  information about SupportChoice and its products and services. Unless specifically authorized by you,  we do not provide Personally Identifiable Information to third parties for  marketing purposes. We may provide information to a  third party in response to a subpoena or to otherwise comply with the law.
  </p>
  <p>
  Contact  Data and Traffic Data are used to gather general statistics about our customers  and visitors. We may use Demographic Data to generate collective information  about our users, but not in a way that identifies any user specifically. For  example, we may inform third parties about the number of registered users and  unique visitors, and the pages most frequently browsed.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Opting Out.</b> You may choose not to provide SupportChoice with Personally  Identifiable Information or you may turn off cookies in your browser by  changing its settings. If you make these decisions, you may continue to visit  the Site and browse its pages. However, SupportChoice cannot process orders  without Personally Identifiable Information. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Generally,  you may not opt-out of service-related communications, which are not  promotional. If you do not wish to receive service-related communications, you  may terminate your account by telephone or email.
  </p>
  <p>
  If  you would like to learn more or opt out of receiving online display advertising  tailored to your interests, please visit the Networking Advertising Initiative  at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> or the Digital  Advertising Alliance at <a href="http://aboutads.info/choices">http://aboutads.info/choices</a>. If you delete your  cookies, use a different browser, or buy a new computer, you will need to renew  your online display advertising opt-out choice.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Website Areas Beyond SupportChoice's Control.</b> The Site may include  interactive forums, such as message boards and chat rooms. Any Personally  Identifiable Information disclosed in these areas is public and becomes public  information. You should use caution when deciding whether to disclose your  personal information in these forums.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Other Transfers.</b> We may share Personally  Identifiable Information and other data with businesses controlling, controlled  by, or under common control with SupportChoice. If SupportChoice is merged,  acquired, or sold, or if some or all of our assets or equity are transferred,  we may disclose or transfer Personally Identifiable Information and other data  in connection with the associated transactions.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Bankruptcy.</b> In the event of a SupportChoice bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or  the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights  generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is  treated, transferred, or used. If such an event occurs, your Personally  Identifiable Information may be treated like any other SupportChoice asset and  sold, transferred, or shared with third parties, or used in ways not  contemplated or permitted under this Privacy Policy, without notice to you or  your consent. 
  </p>
  <h3>Links</h3>

  <b>Third-Party Websites and Third-Party Service Providers.</b> SupportChoice may  maintain links to other websites and other websites may maintain links to the  Site. This Privacy Policy applies only to SupportChoice and not to other  websites accessible from SupportChoice or that you use to access SupportChoice,  each of which may have privacy policies materially different from this Privacy  Policy. If you visit other websites, SupportChoice is not responsible for the privacy  practices or content of those sites. It is your responsibility to review the  privacy policies of non-SupportChoice websites to confirm that you understand  and agree with them.
  </p>
  <p>
  We  may work with third-party service providers that we do not own or control.  Unless authorized by you, we do not provide your Personally Identifiable  Information to any third-party service providers, except as explained in this  Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <h3>Accessing and Changing Your  Account</h3>

  <b>User Access to Order Information. </b>SupportChoice will give  you, or anyone listed as a contact for your account, information about your  order. This may include information about the nature and status of your order,  information you provided to process your order, payment information, and  contact information. For some products, we may provide information about your  order to other individuals named in the order. We also may provide information  to a third party in response to a subpoena or to otherwise comply with the law.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>User Access to and Ability to Update Personally Identifiable  Information.</b> You may visit your personal account profile at any time by  logging in and clicking on the "My Account" link. Through My Account,  you may: (i) review and update your Contact Data; If you want to remove your Personally Identifiable  Information from our Site, you may contact us at info@supportchoice.com.  SupportChoice may maintain some or all of this data  in its archives even after it has been removed from the Site.
  </p>
  <h3>How Secure Is the Personal  Information We Collect?</h3>
  <p><b>Our Commitment to Data Security.</b> We strive to make  certain that our servers and connections incorporate the latest encryption and  security devices. We have implemented physical, electronic, and managerial  procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. Credit card and  personal information are transmitted by secure servers. Unfortunately, no data  transmission is guaranteed to be 100% secure and we therefore cannot guarantee  the security of information you transmit to or from the Site or using our services,  and you provide this information at your own risk. ACCORDINGLY, WE DISCLAIM  LIABILITY FOR THE THEFT, LOSS, OR INTERCEPTION OF, OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR  DAMAGE TO, YOUR DATA OR COMMUNICATIONS. BY USING THE SITE AND OUR SERVICES, YOU  ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND ASSUME THESE RISKS.
