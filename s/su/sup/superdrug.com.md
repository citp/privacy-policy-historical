What is Personal Data?

Personal Data means information that can directly or indirectly identify you (" **Personal Data** "). This typically includes information such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number, but can also include other information such as IP address, shopping habits, information about your health and information about your lifestyle or preferences such as your hobbies and interests. Information about health are called “special categories of Personal Data” that require special protection because of their sensitivity.

#### 4  
What happens when you provide us with your Personal Data or when we otherwise receive your personal data?

We collect your Personal Data directly in a number of ways, for example when you provide us with your information to register as a customer for our Sites or as a Health & Beautycard member, register for prize draws or competitions, subscribe to our newsletter, receive information or mailings, use our applications, buy a product or service from us, complete a survey, complete a beauty or health diagnostic test, make a comment or enquiry or contact our Customer Team.

When you provide us with your Personal Data, we will process it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not wish us to process your Personal Data in this way, please do not provide us with your personal information.

We may also receive your Personal Data from other sources, including information from commercially available sources, such as public databases and data aggregators, and information from third parties. If you do not want us to receive your Personal Data from other sources, please communicate your preferences directly with the relevant sources.

We process your Personal Data to provide you with our services as further explained below. In certain instances, we only process your Personal Data if you have given us permission to do so, for example in most cases where we process your Personal Data for marketing purposes, use cookies or location data or where we process your sensitive personal information. In other instances we may rely on other legal grounds for processing your personal data, such as performance of the contract with you or legitimate interests, like fraud prevention.

If you become a Health & Beautycard member, we may infer in a transparent manner that you would like us to process your Personal Data for marketing purposes. You can always opt out of marketing communications without detriment to your loyalty benefits.
