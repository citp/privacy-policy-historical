## **Introduction**

SupChina, Inc. (“SupChina”, “we,” or “us”) is committed to bringing you information tailored to your individual needs. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information SupChina collects from you when you visit our website [supchina.com](https://www.goboldfish.com/) (the “Site”), use our mobile applications (the “Apps”), or use any other product and services made available by us (collectively, the Site and Apps, the “Services”) and how we use, share and protect that information. If any term in this Privacy Policy is unacceptable to you, please do not use the Services or provide us with any personal data.

We ask that you read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. The use of information collected through our Services will be limited to the purposes described under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service (or other relevant customer contracts). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. Please be aware that if you are using the Services on behalf of an entity, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy for that entity and are representing to us that you have the authority to do so (in which case “you” will refer to that entity). If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use the Services.

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make any changes, we will post the changes on this page and indicate at the top of this page the date the policy was last revised. We will also notify you of any material changes either through a pop-up notice, e-mail or through other reasonable means. Any such changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the Services thereafter. Your continued use of the Services after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new policy.

## **Information We Collect and How We Collect Information**

The information we collect from you falls into two categories: personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and non-personally identifiable information (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify who you are) (“Non-Personal Information”). Personal Information includes your name, telephone number, physical address, email address, company name, and company address.  Non-Personal Information includes your IP address and browser type, the name of the website from which you entered our Site, and which pages you visit on our Site.

We process personal data as defined under data protection laws in various ways depending upon your use of the Services. We process personal data on the following legal bases: (1) with your consent; (2) as necessary to perform our agreement to provide Services; and (3) as necessary for our legitimate interest in providing the Services where those interests do not override your fundamental rights and freedom related to data privacy.

Below are the various ways in which we may collect Personal Information and Non-Personal information from you.

**Information We Automatically Collect**. We and third-party service providers acting on our behalf, which may include third-party analytics service providers and third-party advertisers, may incorporate technology such as “pixel tags”, “web beacons”, and “cookies” that allow us to track the actions of users of our Services automatically. For example, we may automatically collect information about your location, your internet connection, your browser, when you access the Services, the website address that linked you to our Site, the website that you visit after using our Services, and details of how you used our Services, such as how often you used our Services and which features of the Services you used.

**Third-Party Information Collection**. We may also use third-party services that use cookies and/or similar technologies to collect and analyze data about the App or Site use, to complete business transactions and to report on activities and trends.  Such services may also collect data regarding the use of other websites, apps, and online services. The use of this information by those third parties will be governed by their own privacy policies, including, for example, Google’s Analytics Privacy Policy.  For more information, please go to [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).  We may also use the data collected to deliver targeted advertising to you.

Our analytics partners may collect your IP address, which is automatically assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider.  An IP address may be logged when you access the platform, along with the time of the visit. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems and administering the Services.  We may also derive your approximate location (on a city or region level) from your IP address.

**Publicly Posted**. If you post information on public areas of the Site (i.e. comments or blog), that information is visible to and may be collected, stored and used by anyone. By posting information, you agree that you have obtained all necessary consents to make such information public and that doing so will not violate any laws. If you remove information that you have made public through our Services, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of our Services or if other users have copied or saved that information. We are not responsible for the actions of any third parties with whom you share Personal Information.

**Information You Voluntarily Provide to Us**. If you contact us by phone, email, instant message, live chat, social media, or by some other means, we may keep a record of your contact information (including your name, company name, email, address and phone number) and the correspondence. When we send you emails, we may also track whether you open them to determine how to deliver more helpful emails and improve our Services.

**User Accounts**. We will collect and store the information you provide to us if you create an account, such as your name, company name, company address, phone number and email address. You do not have to share this information with us, but without it you may not be able to access certain features or participate in certain aspects of the Services.

**Financial Information**. If you purchase our Services, you may be required to provide financial information, such as your credit card or bank account number, to a third-party payment processor. We do not collect or store such financial information and we are not responsible for the collection or storage of such information by third parties. We will, however, have access to certain information associated with your account should you purchase the Services, including the amount and date of the purchase.

**Information Collected Through Use of the Services**. If you use our Services, we may collect information about how you use and interact with the Services and the data and information that is collected or provided by you through or in connection with your use of the Services.

We may disclose your Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to service providers or other third parties, such as vendors, technical agents, subcontractors and consultants, to perform certain business-related functions that help make the Services and our offerings available and functional, including, but not limited to, design services, installation services, website hosting, data analysis and metrics services, maintenance and technical services, customer service and support, email delivery services, infrastructure services and to help us in our marketing efforts, including managing and delivering contextual and tailored advertisements.

We may also use the information we collect to display advertisements to our advertisers’ target audiences.

We do not actively share Personal Information with third-party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your consent. In addition, we may disclose your Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to a buyer or other successor as part of a merger, acquisition, change of control or other similar business transfer, to government body or other third party if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, or in specific other cases with your consent.

We may disclose aggregated user statistics and other data with our affiliates, agents and current or prospective business partners. This aggregate information does not personally identify you.

The Services may allow you to post information to various third-party services or platforms, such as social networking services like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.  You acknowledge that if you choose to use this feature, your friends, followers, and subscribers on these third-party services or platforms will be able to view such activity.  The use of the information by such social networking websites will be governed by their privacy policies, and we do not control their use of the shared data.

**Required Disclosures of Information**. SupChina will disclose your information where required to do so by law, is subject to a subpoena or other legal proceeding or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms or to protect the security or integrity of our Services; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of SupChina, our users or others.

**Disclosures During a Change of Control.** We may buy or sell/divest/transfer the company (including any shares in the company), or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses. Your information such as customer names and email addresses and other User information related to our Services may be among the items sold or otherwise transferred in these types of transactions. We may also sell, assign or otherwise transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of the company. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.

## **Choices About How We Collect, Use and Disclose Your Information**

We strive to provide you with choices regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of the information you provide to us. The mechanisms listed below aim to provide you with control over such collection, use, and disclosure:

**Marketing Communication**. If you do not want us to send you marketing or promotional communications, you can opt-out by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in any such promotional emails, checking the relevant box located on the form on which we collect your data or emailing us at office@supchina.com.

**Cookies**. You have the option to accept or disable cookies at any time through your browser. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. If you choose to disable your cookies, your user experience may be limited.

**Google Analytics**. You can opt out of tracking by Google Analytics by using Google’s Ads Settings or going to <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>. You may also opt out of Google marketing products, but please note that this does not opt you out of being served generic ads.

**Mobile Analytics** **.**  If you are using our Apps, we use Mobile Device IDs, instead of cookies, to recognize you. We use the Mobile Device IDs and other mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. These Mobile Device IDs are only tracking and collecting Non-Personal Information. The software may record information such as how often you use the Services, the events that occur within the Apps, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the Apps were downloaded from.

**Location Data**. We may collect the physical location of your device by using, for example, satellite, cell phone tower, GPS or WiFi signals.  We use your device’s physical location to provide you with location-based services and content. You may be able to allow or deny such collection and/or use through your device settings or the App’s privacy controls.

**Third-Party Advertising**. If you are interested in more information about tailored advertising and your choices to prevent third parties from delivering tailored web advertisements, you may visit the following websites: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/> or <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>. These opt-out tools are provided by third parties. We do not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools. Please note that you may still receive advertisements from third parties within our Services even if you opt out of tailored advertising but they will not be based on your activity across unrelated websites.

**Do Not Track Signals**. Third parties may keep track of your browsing activities across third party websites. California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) provides that California residents are entitled to know how we respond to “Do Not Track” browser signals. Certain web browsers enable users to activate a “Do Not Track” signal but we do not currently respond to the “Do Not Track” signal or other similar mechanisms.

**Notice to California Residents**. California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a calendar year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please send an email to office@supchina.com.

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Site, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Site. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure that the data is not publicly displayed on the Site, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.

To request any other changes or information about our collection, use or disclosure of your information, please email us at office@supchina.com.

## **Accessing and Correcting Your Information**

If you wish to access, update, correct or delete any Personal Information in our possession that you have previously submitted via the Services, you may log into your account and make updates. If you wish to make changes not available through your account settings, please contact us at office@supchina.com. We do not guarantee that any Personal Information can be removed completely.

**Accountability for Onward Transfer.**  In order to transfer personal information to a third party acting as a controller, we comply with the Notice and Choice Principles. We also enter into a contracts with all third-party controllers that we provide any such data that may only be processed for limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent provided by the individual and that the recipient will provide the same level of protection as the Principles and will notify the Company if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet this obligation. When such a determination is made, the third party controller will cease processing or take other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate.

When transferring personal data to a third party acting as an agent, SupChina: (i) transfers such data only for limited and specified purposes; (ii) ascertains that the agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles; (iii) takes reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent effectively processes the personal information transferred in a manner consistent with the organization’s obligations under the Principles; (iv) requires the agent to notify the Company if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Principles; (v) upon notice, including under (iv), takes reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing; and (vi) provides a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of its contract with that agent to the Department upon request.

The Services may contain advertisements or links to other web sites not operated or controlled by us (the “Third Party Sites”), and the policies and procedures described in this Privacy Policy do not apply to those Third Party Sites, even if you access them through the Services. The links from the Services do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed the Third Party Sites. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Sites you access so you know how they will use and share your information.
