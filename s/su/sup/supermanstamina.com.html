We want to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for consumers, and in particular, ensure that children (i.e. anyone who is under the age of 18) are protected from adult materials. The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to 2GTS, what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit www.2GirlsTeachSex.com, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct the information.</p>

      <p> We use your telephone number only if there is an order-related issue, though because we understand your need for anonymity we will make all attempts to contact you via email. We do not use your telephone number for marketing purposes.</p>
      <p> We may also use that information to let you know of additional products and services about which you might be interested. You can choose not to receive such information if you don't want to by letting us know on the registration screen when you sign up for our service.
