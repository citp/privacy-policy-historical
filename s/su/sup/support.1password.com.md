# Private by design | 1Password

Protecting your privacy is the cornerstone of everything we do. One of our fundamental beliefs is that security and privacy go hand-in-hand, and you can’t have one without the other.

You are the only one who holds the keys to your data. There are no backdoors, no secret entrances. Everything you store in 1Password is encrypted and completely private.

Your data is your data. We don’t use it, we don’t share it, and we don’t sell it. You’re our customer, not our product.

## Only you hold the key to your data

Your Master Password and Secret Key protect your personal and private information. When you sign in to 1Password, your Master Password and Secret Key are never transmitted to the server. This ensures that your passwords stay secure.

When you store items, documents, and passwords in 1Password, all of your data is fully encrypted and protected.

## 1Password respects your privacy

Your privacy is our top priority. A combination of policy, innovative thinking, and a deep respect for your right to privacy ensure that your data is always kept safe and secure.

## Your data is yours and yours alone

The data that you store and save in 1Password is encrypted and inaccessible to us. We will never sell it or give it away, and wherever possible, we won’t even collect it. In fact, the information that we collect is only used to provide you with service and support. Any personally identifiable information that is collected is secured safely on our servers and is never shared with third parties.

## We keep watch over your data

Watchtower alerts you to any vulnerabilities on the sites you visit. Instead of sending a list of your used websites to the server, 1Password downloads the full vulnerability list to your device and checks your logins locally, ensuring your data is always completely private.

Integration with [Have I Been Pwned](https://web.archive.org/haveibeenpwned/) is provided on an opt-in basis. Learn more about [Watchtower](https://watchtower.1password.com/) and its built-in security features.

## Our security isn't stagnant

Your data privacy and storage needs are constantly evolving and we ensure that our security reflects that. Security shouldn’t be stagnant, as hackers and criminals are always finding new methods, which is why we continually refine our security features to keep your information safe and secure.

We’ve earned the trust of millions of customers and security professionals over the past decade, and that took more than promises. It took an open security design that enforces privacy through encryption and proven mathematical principles. 1Password complies with the requirements of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
