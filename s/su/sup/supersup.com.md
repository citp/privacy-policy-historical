Protecting your personal information is a top priority. We utilize the most up to date technologies (Secure Socket Layer) to protect your order information as it is sent over the Internet. We also proactively run server, network, and facility audits to protect against any authorized access, use or disclosure of your information. Additionally, we employ the use of third party security firms which perform site scans and audits to further mitigate any security concerns involving your personal information.

When you visit the Super Supplements site, cookies or other tracking technologies may be placed on your computers or mobile devices. A cookie is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores Non-Personal Information about your account, preferences and use of the Super Supplements site and services. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return to the Super Supplements site and track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. They also help us to detect certain kinds of fraud. We use cookies to store preferences, record session information, record user-specific information on what pages are accessed or visited, alert you to new areas of the Super Supplements site, or customize web page content, services and advertisements based on browser type or other information that the tracking technologies provide.

"Session" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as managing page views and your shopping cart. Typically, your browser will erase session cookies once you exit the browser. "Persistent" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computer or mobile device after you exit the browser. "Persistent" cookies allow us to retrieve certain information that you have previously provided to us (for example, your user ID if you ask to be remembered). The Super Supplements site may use both session and persistent cookies.

The Super Supplements site may also use "tracer tags," which are tiny graphic images placed on Super Supplements site pages or in our e-mails that allow us to determine whether you have performed certain actions. When you access these pages or open e-mail messages, the tags generate a notice of that action to us or our Service Providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.

You may manage, block or delete cookies and other tracking technologies by adjusting your browser's security and privacy settings but, if you do so, you may not be able to use particular features of the Super Supplements site or the Services.
