# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy was last updated on November 9, 2012.

SupplyFrame, Inc. (“ **SupplyFrame** ,” “ **we** ,” or “ **us** ”) takes the privacy and protection of personal information very seriously. By visiting and using the SupplyFrame Offerings or registering for the SupplyFrame Offerings and creating an Account, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy (“ **Privacy Policy** ”). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Frame-It Terms of Service that you can find at Frame-It Terms of Service and which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference.

### What This Privacy Policy Covers

This Privacy Policy describes SupplyFrame’s practices with respect to Personal Information and Anonymous Information that we collect when you use the SupplyFrame Offerings. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use of your Personal Information that is collected by third parties that SupplyFrame does not own or control or that do not support SupplyFrame in providing the SupplyFrame Offerings.

“ **Personal Information** ” is information that is personally identifiable like names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or phone numbers, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.

“ **Anonymous Information** ” means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons.

We collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy Policy from users of the SupplyFrame Offerings (“ **Users** ”).

BY USING THE SERVICE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICE, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY AND BY USING THE SERVICE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE EXPRESSLY CONSENTING TO SUCH PROCESSING.

### Personal Information We Collect

We collect the following Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily:

  * If you register for the SupplyFrame Offerings and create an Account, we collect a username, your e-mail address, and a password for your Account.
  * When you register for the SupplyFrame Offerings we collect, on an optional basis, certain information to complete your profile, including your name, gender, birthday, phone number, address, city, state, country, and website.
  * If you participate in one of our surveys, we will collect any Personal Information contained in your responses to such survey and any additional profile information you provide. When you contact us by sending us an e-mail, we will collect any information that is contained in (and/or attached to) your e-mail.
  * If you make a posting or comment on a posting on the SupplyFrame Offerings, we will collect any Personal Information contained in such posting.
  * If you sign up for a feature of the SupplyFrame Offerings for which we charge a fee, we will collect your first and last name, billing address, credit card or payment account number and any other information needed to complete the transaction.
  * We may also collect Personal Information, such as demographic information from you via the SupplyFrame Offerings or at other points in the Sites that state that Personal Information is being collected.



### Personal Information Collected Via Technology

As you use the SupplyFrame Offerings, certain information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol (IP) address and the browser that you use to visit the Sites. We may use a “reverse IP lookup” to determine the company associated with your IP address. SupplyFrame also stores a small text file called a “ **Cookie** ” on your computer to store your login information (if any) and your personal preferences for the SupplyFrame Offerings. SupplyFrame may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). While you will still be able to use the SupplyFrame Offerings if you disable Cookies in your browser, certain parts of the SupplyFrame Offerings may not function as effectively. Notwithstanding any settings you may make in your browser, you expressly consent to our use of Cookies in connection with the SupplyFrame Offerings as set forth above.

Since the foregoing information may be collected when you are signed into the SupplyFrame Offerings or after you click on a link contained in an email sent by us, this information may be associated by us with Personal Information that we have collected from you.

### Personal Information From Other Sources

We may receive Personal Information about you from outside the Sites, such as from third parties that provide services for us that are related to the SupplyFrame Offerings. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via the SupplyFrame Offerings.

### Use Of Information We Collect

In general, information (including Personal Information) you submit to us, or to third parties that support us in collecting information, is used by us to provide you and others with the SupplyFrame Offerings, to respond to requests that you make, to improve our SupplyFrame Offerings and to better tailor the features, performance and support of the SupplyFrame Offerings.

We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with notifications related to your use of the SupplyFrame Offerings, such as electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails, should you request to receive such communications from us. 

We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the information personally identifiable to you. We may also create Anonymous Information on how you use the SupplyFrame Offerings. We may use this Anonymous Information for internal purposes, such as analyzing usage patterns so that we may enhance the SupplyFrame Offerings, and we also reserve the right to use and disclose any Anonymous Information at our discretion.

### Feedback

If you provide feedback about the SupplyFrame Offerings to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any purpose, provided we do not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. We will collect any information contained in such feedback and will treat the Personal Information in it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### Disclosure of Personal Information

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose to or share your Personal Information with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so. Please note that we may disclose certain of your Personal Information, such as your username, to other Users of certain SupplyFrame Offerings in order to identify you as a User of the SupplyFrame Offerings. In addition, certain information that you have provided on an optional basis in connection with registering with our SupplyFrame Offerings (your gender, birthday, phone number, address, city, state, country, and website) may be made available on your profile to other Users of all the SupplyFrame Offerings; please make sure that you only provide the information that you feel comfortable sharing with others in this way.

We may enter into agreements with companies that provide the SupplyFrame Offerings by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer their products and/or services on our website (“ **Third Party Companies** ”). A Third Party Company may want access to Personal Information that we collect from its customers. As a result, we may disclose your Personal Information to a Third Party Company; however, we will not disclose your Personal Information to Third Party Companies for the Third Party Companies’ own direct marketing purposes, unless you have “opted-in” by following the instructions we provide to allow such disclosure. If you have opted-in to receive e-mail communications from a Third Party Company and later wish to discontinue receipt of these e-mails, please contact the Third Party Company directly to update your preferences. The privacy policies of our Third Party Companies may apply to the use and disclosure of your Personal Information that we collect and disclose to such Third Party Companies. Because we do not control the privacy practices of our Third Party Companies, you should read and understand their privacy policies. 

We may provide your Personal Information to third party service providers and suppliers who work on behalf of or with us to provide you with some of the services and features of the SupplyFrame Offerings and to help us communicate with our users (including in connection with payments). However, these service providers and suppliers do not have any independent right to use this information except to help us provide the SupplyFrame Offerings.

We may share some or all of your Personal Information with any parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “ **Affiliates** ”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.

In the event SupplyFrame goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of SupplyFrame or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. You hereby consent to SupplyFrame sharing your Personal Information under the above circumstances.

We may (and you authorize us to) disclose information we have collected from and about you (including Personal Information) if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; (b) to enforce any agreement we may have entered into with you and to enforce the Privacy Policy; or (c) to protect and defend the rights or property of us, other Users, or third parties.

### Choices Regarding Personal Information

We will include unsubscribe instructions in each newsletter or promotional communication you receive from us.

We may send you service-related announcements (such as, but not limited to, notice that we have changed the Service, the Terms of Service, or the Privacy Policy) when we believe it is necessary to do so. You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature, but if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to terminate the Account you may have with us. You understand that any termination of your Account may involve deletion of your Account information (and associated Content) from our live databases and all the information and data stored for such Account in the SupplyFrame Offerings. SupplyFrame will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any termination of your account or related deletion of you information.

### Modifying and Deleting Your Personal Information

You may change any of your Personal Information in your account by editing your profile within the SupplyFrame Offerings. You may request deletion of your Personal Information by us, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete Personal Information that we have collected from or about you, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives.

The SupplyFrame Offerings may contain links to other web sites that are not owned or controlled by SupplyFrame. The provision of such links is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such web sites or location or its contents. We have no control over, do not review and are not responsible for the privacy policies of or content displayed on such other web sites. Please be aware that the terms of the Privacy Policy do not apply to any outside web sites.
