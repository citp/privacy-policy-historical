Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

We may collect your location based information for the purpose of providing you with the correct version of the application.  We will not share this information with any third party.  If you no longer wish to allow us to track or use this information, you may turn it off at the device level.  Please note, the application may not work properly if we are unable to tell where you are coming from (Country specific).  
In addition, we create a unique user ID to track your use of our Service.  This unique user ID is stored in connection with your profile information to track the Supercell games you are playing.

**Facebook Connect, Game Center and Google+**

You can log in to our site using sign-in services (“SN Service”) such as Facebook Connect , Apple’s Game Center, or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name, email address, and resume to pre-populate our sign up form.  Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.

**Invite a Friend**

Supercell may offer you the opportunity to invite your contacts from a SN Service (such as your Facebook friends) so that those contacts can be located in Supercell games and/or you can invite them to join you in Supercell games.  Such contact information will be used only for the purpose of sending communications to the addressee.  You or the third party may contact us at support@supercell.net to request the removal of this information from our database to the extent Supercell stores any of this information.

**Customer Service**

We may collect your email address when you contact our customer service group and we may use that email address to contact you about your gaming experience with Supercell games and notify you about company news and promotions. If you no longer wish to receive certain email notifications you may opt-out at any time by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each communication or by emailing us at support@supercell.net.

We may occasionally send you push notifications through our mobile applications to send you game updates, high scores and other service related notifications that may be of importance to you.  You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by turning them off at the device level through your settings.

**Game Data Collection**

Whenever you play our games, we collect anonymous data about all of your interactions with the game and with the other players inside the game via server log files.  This information may be associated with your player ID, IP address or device ID for the purpose of providing you our Services and improving them. This data is stored within Amazon Web Services.

**Other Collection**

We may also acquire information from you through (1) your access and participation in message boards on the Service, (2) your participation in surveys regarding the Service or (3) your participation in a sweepstakes or contest through the Service.

We may provide you the opportunity to participate in a sweepstakes or contest through our Service. If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you.  Participation in these sweepstakes and contests are voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

We use this information to notify winners and award prizes, to monitor traffic or personalize the Service.  We may use a third party service provider to conduct these sweepstakes or contests; that company is prohibited from using your users’ personal information for any other purpose. 

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file that we transfer to your computer and/or device, to identify a user's computer/device and to "remember" things about your visit, such as your preferences or a user name and password.  Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your personal information, such as your user ID, for purposes such as improving the quality of our Service, tailoring recommendations to your interests, and making the Service easier to use.  You can disable cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use features of the Service.

We may feature advertisements served by third parties that deliver cookies to your computer/device so the content you access and advertisements you see can be tracked.  Since the third party advertising companies associate your computer/device with a number, they will be able to recognize your computer/device each time they send you an advertisement.  These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service and third party sites and applications in order to measure advertisement performance and to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for the data collection practices of these third party advertisers, and we encourage you to check their privacy policies to learn more about their use of cookies and other technology.

You may click on the following link: <http://www.supercell.net/partner-opt-out> for information on how to opt-out of the use of cookies for the delivery of more relevant advertising.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**

We employ or our third party tracking utility partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages or e-mails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may associate this information with your IP address or device identifier but do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information.

**Mobile Analytics**

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your device. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application.

**Third Party Services**

Our services may contain third party tracking tools from our service providers, examples of which include Google Analytics, Flurry and HasOffers. Such third parties may use cookies, APIs, and SDKs in our services to enable them to collect and analyze user information on our behalf. The third parties may have access to information such as your device identifier, MAC address, IMEI, locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), geo-location information, and IP address for the purpose of providing their services under their respective privacy policies. Our privacy policy does not cover the use of tracking tools from third parties.  We do not have access or control over these third parties.

We may feature advertising within our Service.  The advertisers may collect and use information about you, such as your Service session activity, device identifier, MAC address, IMEI, geo-location information and IP address.  They may use this information to provide advertisements of interest to you.  Please refer to our list of partners within the Services and for more information on how to opt out at: <http://www.supercell.net/partner-opt-out>.

In addition, you may see our games advertised in other services.  After clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our game, you will become a user of our Service.  In order to verify the installs, a device identifier may be shared with the advertiser.
