Protecting children's privacy is important to us.

We request that all users of the Web site and the Learning Platform who are under the age of thirteen (13) not disclose or provide any Personal Information. If we discover that a child under thirteen (13) has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete that child's Personal Information from our records.

  19. _Notice to Minors_



In addition to protecting the privacy of children under age (13) we are committed to protect the privacy of minors.

Thus, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, so you do so at your own risk. Please note that non-encrypted communication using email is not secure.
