				<p><strong>Effective January 2009</strong></p>
				<p>
				Welcome to SuperSecret.com and thanks 
				for visiting our Privacy Policy page.  SuperSecret (which we might 
				also call "the SuperSecret world" or "our Website") is a safe, 
				age-appropriate site where tweens can play and learn basic online social 
				skills.  On this page, we'll talk about three things:				</p>
				
					<ol class="number_indent">
						<li>What types of information we collect from our SuperSecret players (and their parents),</li>
						<li> How we use that information, and </li>
						<li> How parents can stay in control over their children's activities.</li>
					</ol>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p>
				<strong>Special Message for Parents</strong>				</p>
				<p> 
				At SuperSecret, we believe that children 
				should be able to use the Internet to play, learn, and socialize in 
				a safe, private, and fun environment.  To do our part in achieving 
				this goal, we take the following steps:				</p>
				
				<ul class="bullet_indent_3">
				  <li><strong>Online Safety.</strong>
				    We have designed our virtual world to allow for a safe interactive environment.  
				    This includes (among other things) educating our players about online 
				    safety in this Policy, offering important safety tools such as player 
				    reporting and blocking, and using filtering technology and moderation 
				    to help protect children from inappropriate or unsafe chat with other 
				    players.   </li>
				  <li><strong>Parental Control.  </strong> We give parents control over their children's activities on SuperSecret, 
				    including the ability to approve or change their child's chat level 
				    and to shut down their child's account ( <a href="#0.1_ParentalAccess" title="ParentalAccess"><strong> <u>See Section 7 below</u> </strong></a> ). </li>
				  <li><strong>Privacy.  </strong> We ask children for very little information (but nothing personal about 
				    them) in order to allow them to play in the SuperSecret world.  
				    This means that it is very difficult for us or other players to have 
				    direct personal contact with children on SuperSecret. </li>
				  </ul>
				<br>
				
				<p> 
				The rest of this Policy will give your child (and you) more information about the measures above. If you have any questions or concerns about this Policy, please contact <a name="0.1__Hlt217894704"></a><a name="0.1__Hlt217894705"></a><a href="http://www.supersecret.com/login-server/spring/contact.jsp"><br><strong><u>SuperSecret Customer Support</u></strong></a>.

				<p class="pgBotNav"><a name="0.1_InfoCollectionUse"><strong>
				1. What information we ask for, and how do we use it?</strong></a>				</p>
				<p> 
				It depends on what you're trying 
				to do on our Website.  Below are some examples when we might ask 
				for information, the types of information we ask for, and how we use 
				the information you give us.  No matter what you're doing on 
				SuperSecret, we only ask you for the information we need to provide 
				you with the service or feature you're requesting.  In other 
				words, we won't make you give us more information about yourself or 
				anyone else if we don't need it to give you that service or feature.        <br>
				</p>
				<p><a name="0.1_CreatingAccount"> <strong><u>A. 
				Creating an account</u>  </strong> </a></p>
				When you first create an account, 
				we ask you to give us the following information:
				<ul class="bullet_indent_3">
				  <li><i>Character name and password</i>.  
				    This information allows you to create your own SuperSecret account and 
				    to login to play in the SuperSecret world.  We also use your character 
				    name to display it in the SuperSecret world, keep track of the Spenders 
				    and Age Points you earn and spend while you play, and link any paid 
				    memberships to your account (see paragraph B below).  Your character 
				    name and password must not be your real name or other personal information, 
				    and you should set up a password that only you and your parent will 
				    remember but that's hard for others to guess.     </li>
				  <li><i>Birthday.  </i> We collect birthday so we can gather the ages of all our players and 
				    then tailor the SuperSecret world to our players' interests.  Your 
				    age information might also be used to determine whether your parent's 
				    permission is needed before you can use certain features on SuperSecret. </li>
				  <li><i>Parent's 
				    Email Address.</i> If you want to use advanced features like text chat 
				    (or "Super Chat"), we ask for your parent's email address and 
				    use it to request and verify their permission.  If your parent 
				    does not respond to our request within a certain amount of days, the 
				    email address is deleted from our records and your request to use text 
				    chat is cancelled.  You will still be allowed to play in the world 
				    and access basic features like menu chat (or "Simple Chat"). </li>
				  </ul>
				<br>
				<a name="0.1_AcctInfoUse"><strong>Your account information, 
				which may also include information about your parent (such as email 
				address and billing information), could also be used for the following <u>
				reasons</u>:</strong></a>
				<ul class="bullet_indent_3">
				  <li> To block your access to 
				    SuperSecret if other players are reporting you for valid reasons or 
				    if you violate SuperSecret's Terms of Service; </li>
				  <li> To help you set up a new 
				    password if you forget your old one; </li>
				  <li> To allow parents to review 
				    and make changes to your account and membership status; and </li>
				  <li> To communicate with your 
				    parent via email about updates to the SuperSecret world, changes to 
				    your account, or other important announcements. </li>
				  </ul>
				  
				  <br><a href="#">Back to top »</a><br><br><br>
				  
				<p><a name="0.1_InvitingFriend"> <strong><u>B.  Paid 
				Membership</u></strong> </a>  </p>
				<p> To buy a paid membership on SuperSecret 
				(which might be required to age-up and get certain privileges in the 
				world), we ask your parent for billing information, including your parent's 
				name, email address, phone number, and credit card information.  
				This information is used to process and confirm payments and to communicate 
				with your parent about your paid membership (for example, if we have 
				a problem charging the credit card, to send membership expiration reminders, 
				etc.).  We might also use this information for the reasons listed 
				under  <a href="#0.1_AcctInfoUse" title="AcctInfoUse"><strong> Section 
				1A above ("Creating an account"). </strong></a>     <br>
				</p>
				
				<a href="#">Back to top »</a><br><br><br>
				
				<p><a name="0.1_InvitingFriend"><strong><u>C. Inviting a friend</u></strong> </a></p>
				<p> SuperSecret allows you to invite friends 
				to join SuperSecret or to become "friends" on SuperSecret with other 
				players by using the "Add Friend" feature (the yellow + button at 
				the bottom left of your SuperSecret screen).  You can do this by 
				entering your first name and your friend's email address or their 
				SuperSecret character name on the Add Friend form.  If you choose 
				to give us your friend's email address, we will use it to send them 
				a one-time email invitation to join SuperSecret, but we will not keep 
				your friend's email address or your first name.    <br>
				</p>
				<p> If your friend or the other player 
				accepts your friend request, his/her character name will be listed as 
				a friend under your phone in the SuperSecret world.  The same is 
				true if you accept a friend request from another player - your character 
				name will be listed as a friend under their SuperSecret phone.   <br>
				</p>
				
				<a href="#">Back to top »</a><br><br><br>
				
				<p><a name="0.1_Chatting"> <strong><u>D. Chatting</u></strong> </a></p>
				<p> There are two types of chat on SuperSecret: 
				Simple Chat and Super Chat (explained below).  Please note that 
				both kinds of chat are designed not to allow you to post or share personal 
				information, like your home address or phone number.  We do this 
				to help protect your safety, and we hope you never share this type of 
				information with strangers on the Internet or in real life.    <br>
				</p>
				<ul class="bullet_indent_3">
				  <li><i><strong>Menu Chat</strong> or 
				      <strong>"Simple Chat"</strong> </i>allows you to chat with other players by choosing 
				    from a menu of words, short sentences, and emotions that we at SuperSecret 
				    created ahead of time.  These may also be called "phrases," 
				    "emoticlouds," or other similar things.  If you only have access 
				    to Simple Chat, you can only post messages using the Simple Chat menu, 
				    and you can only get messages from other players using the Simple Chat 
				    menu.  You cannot create your own chat messages or get the chat 
				    messages created by other players. </li>
				  <li><i><strong>Text Chat</strong> or 
				      <strong>"Super Chat"</strong> </i>allows you to chat with other players by writing 
				    your own chat messages.  In other words, you don't have to choose 
				    from the Simple Chat menu (you can if you still want to).  If you 
				    have access to Super Chat, you can only send your Super Chat messages 
				    to other players who also have access to Super Chat.  To make Super 
				    Chat safer, we use something called "real-time filtering technology."  
				    This is software that helps us stop players from posting chat messages 
				    that might contain bad words, personal information like your phone number 
				    or home address, or other information we think could be harmful or offensive 
				    to our players.  We also have real people (not just computers) 
				    who review what is happening in the SuperSecret world for safety purposes.  
				    We need your parent's permission before you can use Super Chat. </li>
			  </ul>
				<br>
				<p> You can use Simple Chat or Super Chat 
				either in a "scene" where the messages are displayed in bubbles 
				above each character's head, or on your SuperSecret "phone," where 
				messages are sent only between you and a friend.  
				Chat that is sent through your SuperSecret phone cannot be seen by other 
				players in the SuperSecret world.    <br></p>
				<p> No matter what form of chat you use, 
				we keep a log of your chat messages for at least 90 days.   
				We do this mostly so we can monitor what's happening on SuperSecret 
				for safety reasons.  We also do this so you can see a history of 
				all the chat messages posted in a scene during your play session (including 
				your own messages).  This is available by clicking on the "Chat 
				Log" arrow that appears right above the chat box.  Please remember 
				that the Chat Log history can be viewed by all the players in a scene 
				at the time of your play session.  If you don't want everyone 
				else to see what you post, don't use chat or chat only with a friend 
				using your SuperSecret phone.   <br></p>
				<p> We've designed our chat features 
				so that the Chat Log history should not contain any personal information 
				about you or others.  Also, in the Chat Log history, each player 
				can see only the chat messages he/she has access to.  For example, 
				if you only have access to Simple Chat, your Chat Log history will show 
				only the messages posted by other players using Simple Chat.  You 
				will not see messages posted by other players using Super Chat.    <br>
				</p>
				<p> Please note that unless you only use 
				Simple Chat, we can't guarantee that personal information will never 
				get through our filters.  So please be smart when chatting and 
				follow the tips we give you on our Safety page under the section <strong>
				<a href="#0.1_Security">("Keeping it Safe: Your Part").</a> <br>
				</strong> </p>
				
				<a href="#">Back to top »</a><br><br><br>
				
				<p><a name="0.1_Blocking"> <strong><u>E. 
				Blocking or reporting players</u></strong></a> </p>
				<p> When you block or report another player, 
				we do not ask for any personal information about you or the player you're 
				reporting.  You simply click on the player you want to block or 
				report and then click on "block" or "report".  Blocking 
				a player makes that other player invisible to you and makes you invisible 
				to that other player.  To unblock a player, you have to contact <a href="http://www.supersecret.com/login-server/spring/contact.jsp"><br><strong><u>Customer Support</u></strong></a>.  If you report another player, we might 
				ask you to tell us why you're reporting the other player so we will 
				know what type of action to take.    <br>
				</p>
				
				<a href="#">Back to top »</a><br><br><br>
				
				<p><a name="0.1_Other"> <strong><u>F. 
				Other Website forms</u></strong> </a></p>
				<p> Once in a while, we might have forms 
				on our Website that you could fill out and, in some cases, send back 
				to SuperSecret.  These forms will probably ask for very little 
				information, and will have a specific purpose that is made clear on 
				the form itself.  Examples might include forms that are used to 
				contact SuperSecret, send us a suggestion or feedback, enter an online 
				contest, or forward a special greeting card or other message to a friend.  
				If any of these activities require that we get your parent's permission, 
				we will be sure to do that first.    <br></p>

				<p class="pgBotNav"><a name="0.1_Security"> <strong>2. How do we keep 
				your information safe and secure?</strong></a> </p>
				<p> SuperSecret does many things to help 
				keep your account information safe and out of the hands of the wrong 
				people.  We've listed some of them below.    <br>
				</p>
				<ul class="bullet_indent_3">
				  <li> We store your account information 
				    on secure servers behind firewalls.  This is just a fancy way of 
				    saying that we put up very strong walls between the outside world and 
				    your account.  These walls are very hard to break down. </li>
				  <li> We process and store credit 
				    card information through a vendor who uses standard security techniques, 
				    like encryption, to keep the information secure.  We, at SuperSecret, 
				    do not even have access to full credit card numbers and we do not display 
				    any portion of your parent's credit card number on your account information 
				    page. </li>
				  <li> We make you create an account 
				    with a password so that hopefully only you and your parents know how 
				    to get into your account.  Your password is the key to your account, 
				    so please make sure to keep your password a secret and never share it 
				    with anyone except your parents. </li>
				  <li> We only allow some people 
				    at SuperSecret and at our vendors (but not everyone) to see your account 
				    and any other information, like billing information, tied to your account.  
				    These are people who need to be able to see your information to do their 
				    job and to make SuperSecret work for you.  Please read <a href="#0.1_WhoCollectsInfo" title="WhoCollectsInfo"><strong> <u>Section 4 
				      below</u></strong></a> for more information. </li>
				  <li> We have designed our chat 
				    features with your safety in mind.  To find out more, please read <a href="#0.1_Chatting" title="Chatting"><strong> <u>Section 1D above</u></strong></a>. </li>
				  <li> We expect you (with your 
				    parents' help) to be smart about what you do on SuperSecret.  
				    Please read "<strong><a href="http://www.supersecret.com/login-server/spring/safetyYourPart.jsp">Keeping it Safe: Your Part</a>" </strong> on our Safety page for some tips on how to stay safer on SuperSecret

				<p class="pgBotNav"><a name="0.1_Cookies"> <strong>3. 
				Do we use cookies or log files on SuperSecret?</strong></a> </p>
				<p> Like many other websites on the Internet 
				today, we use cookies to help make our Website work properly and to 
				save you time.  Cookies are basically text files (which look like 
				a long string of numbers, letters, or other characters) that we place 
				on your computer.  For example, cookies might remember certain 
				things about your SuperSecret account, like your character name for 
				faster login and your paid membership status.    <br>
				</p>
				<p> We might also use something called 
				"log files" to gather important information about your computer, 
				like your computer's IP address, the type of Internet browser you 
				use (Internet Explorer, Mozilla, etc.), and the type of software your 
				computer runs on (Windows, Mac OS, etc.).  Log files might also 
				tell us things about your visit to our Website, like which website you 
				came from to get to ours ("referring URL"), the date and time of 
				your visit ("timestamp"), and more information about where and what 
				you clicked on in the SuperSecret world.  We use log file information 
				to improve the way our Website works, fix technical problems, do research 
				and Website analysis, and make SuperSecret safer.       <br>
				</p>
				<p> We do not use cookies or log files 
				to collect any personal information about you or others.  We might 
				combine information in a cookie or log file together with personal information 
				we might have gotten from you or your parent somewhere else on our Website 
				(like when you created an account or when your parent bought a paid 
				membership).

				information on SuperSecret?</strong> </a></p>
				<p> Our company, called SuperSecret, Inc. 
				and located in the United States, collects your information.  This 
				is true no matter where you live or access our Website.  By using 
				SuperSecret, you agree that it's okay for us to transfer your information

				<p> In some cases, your information is

				because they are only allowed to collect and use your information the 
				ways we tell them to, and no other way.  If any vendor is allowed

				Do we share your information with other companies or people

				legal reasons or because another company buys or takes over our company.  
				These types of events don't happen very often.  If we had to 
				share any of your personal information because we were bought or taken

				</p>
				<p> Once in a while, we might put together 
				a lot of information about SuperSecret players and the different ways 
				our players use SuperSecret (but nothing "personal" like names or 
				email addresses) and then share this information with third parties.  
				This is what we call "aggregate data sharing."  We might do 
				this so that third parties can help us figure out what parts of our 
				Website are most popular, what types of individuals are playing on our 
				Website (demographic analysis), and ways we can continue to improve 
				our service. <strong><br>
