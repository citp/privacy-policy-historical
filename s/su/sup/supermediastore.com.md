We are committed to protect your privacy online the best we can. We have created our Privacy Policy ("Policy") Statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of our shoppers.

##  What information does SuperMediaStore.com collect?

* * *

In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, we collect two forms of visitor information: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Some of this information is collected by third parties who may be placing and reading cookies on visitors’ browsers, or may use web beacons or similar technologies to collect information in connection with promotions or programs such as the Google Trusted Stores program. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a customized, smooth, and efficient shopping session.

##  Non-Personally Identifiable Information

* * *

This refers to information that does not, by itself, identify you as a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based on where you have shopped for on our web site in several ways. This information is then compiled and analyzed on both an individual and an aggregate basis. Such non-personally identifiable information may include demographics and interest data. We use data from Google's Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) with Google Analytics. We use Google Analytics' Demographic and Interest Reporting Tools to figure out the general types of people who visit our store. Additional non-personally identifiable information may also include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") information as well as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route or reroute information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, which allows web servers to locate and to identify your computer. Computers require an IP addresses in order for users to communicate over the Internet.
