**What information does Supermediastore.com collect?**

This information is then compiled and analyzed on both personally and an aggregatly basis. Such information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") information as well as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and resources on the World Wide Web.

Computer requires a IP address in order for user to communicate over the Internet.
