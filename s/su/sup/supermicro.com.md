# Supermicro, Inc. - About Supermicro | Privacy

We Respect Your Privacy

**Your Privacy Is Important To Us!**  
Supermicro is committed to user privacy in our services and products. This Privacy Policy outlines our personal information handling practices. If a user provides us with personal information, we treat it according to this Policy. We created this Privacy Policy to detail our commitment to protect the privacy of clients, customers, and users, and to insure the integrity of the Internet. Supermicro reserves the right to change its Privacy Policy at any time without notice. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post the changes on this WebSite so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.

**Security Measures**  
Supermicro protects the personal information you provide us. Access to users' personal information is limited to people who need it to perform their job functions. Authorized third-party agents may also need access to some of users' personal information. For example, if Supermicro needs to ship products to customers, it shares the customer's name and address with the shipping company. Supermicro only provides third-party agents with the minimum amount of information needed to complete the requested transaction. Otherwise, we do not share personal information with third-parties without the user's permission to do so.

Supermicro may respond to court orders, subpoenas, or legal process. Supermicro may choose to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Supermicro may collect and share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected fraud, illegal activities, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Supermicro's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

**Types and Uses of Personal Information**  
Supermicro may use your personal information in the following ways: 

  * **Account Information** \- Tells Supermicro who you are, how to ship products to you, how to contact you, and provides billing information.

Parents should be aware of the sites their children visit and whether those sites are appropriate for them.

Children should be taught never to provide personal information about themselves unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult.

The information users choose to send us is described below as "optional information."

Supermicro's Websites use cookies. A cookie is a small data file residing on your system that a web site can write to your hard drive when visited. A cookie stores useful information that enables our WebSites to remember users when they return. We only use cookie files to store the login information for various areas of our WebSites such as Technical Support or Account Management system, so that users do not need to manually login on each visit. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. If you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You can refuse cookies by disabling them in your browser. However, if cookies are disabled, some sites may not allow users to conduct certain activities. Supermicro can only read cookies from Supermicro WebSites. If a user chooses to disable cookies in their browser, the user can usually still access our WebSites.

For this kind of cookie, the information stored in the cookie might include the following (formatted for legibility):

Advertisers use personal information to target the advertisements and measure impact.

Visitors can later supply additional information they wish to share with others as part of their profile. This information is used solely to login to the support system and for no other purpose.

Additional Uses of Personal Information

Client information is used to route the requested Web page to your computer for viewing. In theory, the requested Web page and the routing information could be discerned by other entities involved in transmitting the requested page to you. We do not control the privacy practices of those entities. Essential and non-essential technical information helps us respond to your request in an appropriate format and helps us make WebSite improvements.

Optional information helps us provide services or information tailored more specifically to your needs or to forward your message or inquiry to another entity that is better able to do so. It also helps us make WebSite improvements. We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our WebSites. For example, we may report that _A_ number of individuals visited a certain area on our WebSite, or that _B_ number of men and _C_ number of women filled out our registration form. We do not disclose information that could be used to identify users.

Supermicro may retain client information after the Web page is transmitted. We do not try to obtain information to link it to individuals who browse our Websites. However, on rare occasions when a user unlawfully attempts to breach computer security, logs of access information are retained to permit a security investigation. In such cases, the information may be forwarded to law enforcement agencies.

Under the federal Freedom of Information Act, any records in our possession at the time of a Freedom of Information Act Request may be subject to inspection by or disclosed to members of the public.

**We use the information** you provide when placing an order or requesting support only to complete the order or support request. We do not share this information with third parties except to the extent necessary to complete the order or request. Similarly, we use information you provide about third parties when placing an order or request only to complete that order or request. We do not share the information with third parties except to the extent necessary to complete the order or request.

We do not use or share personally identifiable information provided to us online other than as described herein without notice to the user and an opportunity to prohibit such use.

Supermicro's WebSite users may choose not to provide personal information. However, certain features of our WebSites will not work without routing information and/or essential technical information.
