<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Legal FormsLast Updated: July 1, 2009</p>
<p>SuperSimpleBlogging strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of  Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience.  We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address,  street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy.  We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third  party. Period.”</p>
<p><strong>How we gather information from users</strong></p><strong>
</strong><p><strong></strong>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting,  the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For  example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to  certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or  when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in  sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive  areas of our site. Like most Web sites, SuperSimpleBlogging also collects  information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be  transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet  Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information  from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and  password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you  visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular  advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may  also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose  not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to  refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain  portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password,  and we may not be able to customize the site’s features according to your  preferences.</p>
<p><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong></p><strong>
</strong><p><strong></strong>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and  deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and  do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you)  may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your  usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help  enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or  what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be  shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does  not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to  identify you individually.</p>
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on  SuperSimpleBlogging to communicate with you about your registration and  customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and  products offered by SuperSimpleBlogging and other topics we think you might find  of interest.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by SuperSimpleBlogging may also  be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration,  troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of  sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third  parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web  hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your  information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we  continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other  companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the  transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court  order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by  law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to  law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please  note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such  cases.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</strong></p><strong>
</strong><p><strong></strong>SuperSimpleBlogging expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to  respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties,  including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers  accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection  policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link  to, or view as part of a frame on a SuperSimpleBlogging page, certain content  that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through  SuperSimpleBlogging you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information,  Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties.  SuperSimpleBlogging is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third  parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties  when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third  parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your  preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our  advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the  advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before.  Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third  parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.  SuperSimpleBlogging does not control the use of this technology by third parties  or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies  of such third parties.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally  Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information  can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without  our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or  third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of SuperSimpleBlogging and  this policy.</p>
<p><strong>Children</strong></p><strong>
</strong><p><strong></strong>SuperSimpleBlogging does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally  Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by  law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in  violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you  believe SuperSimpleBlogging has any information from or about anyone under 13,  please contact us at the address listed below.</p>

<p>Changes to this Policy</p>
<p>SuperSimpleBlogging reserves the right to change this policy at any time.  Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site  following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those  changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be  used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information  was collected.</p>
<p><strong>Governing law</strong></p><strong>
</strong><p><strong></strong>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by California law. If a  dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with the  help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: Orange. Any  costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with the mediation will be  shared equally by each of us.</p>
<p>If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through  mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration at the  following location: Orange, under the rules of the American Arbitration  Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered  in any court with jurisdiction to do so.</p>
<p>SuperSimpleBlogging is controlled, operated and administered entirely within  California. This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to  and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any  party.</p>
