## 1\. BRANCHOUT BASICS

Through the BranchOut Services, you have the opportunity for potential employers, business partners, BranchOut customers, professional contacts and friends to find and learn about you based on your existing Facebook profile, which is the basis for your BranchOut profile. We allow our members to learn about business opportunities and jobs and obtain Introductions.

Users may be individual job seekers, recruiters, sales professionals or others looking for professional connections. There are primarily two types of users on BranchOut:

  * **BranchOut User.** A BranchOut User is a user who has registered to join BranchOut by installing any of the BranchOut Services or who has otherwise logged into BranchOut to use the BranchOut Services.
  * **Connections.** Your Connections consist of your connections to (1) other BranchOut Users and (2) persons who are not BranchOut Users, but are connected to you through your Facebook social network (e.g., a Facebook friend or a second-degree Facebook friend). A BranchOut User who searches for a job, a company or organization, or a person on BranchOut will see any Connections he or she has to the applicable company (or organization) or person.
  * **Enterprise Users.** Enterprise Users are BranchOut Users who are recruiters, sales professionals and other customers looking for qualified candidates, business partners, and sales leads. We may charge Enterprise Users a fee for accessing the BranchOut Services and we may offer special services to Enterprise Users. Like all BranchOut Users, Enterprise Users will have access to view your BranchOut Profile and Connections and may contact you through the communication tools provided by Facebook.



Please note that your BranchOut Profile and your Connections will be visible to all other users of BranchOut. You will be able to contact other BranchOut users through their Facebook page and in accordance with their settings on Facebook. Other BranchOut Users will be able to contact you in the same way, also in accordance with your settings through Facebook.

## 2\. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE BRANCHOUT SERVICES

  1. **Information We Receive From Facebook**

BranchOut believes that your friends and family are your true support network both personally and professionally. Thus, BranchOut allows you to establish a professional network on BranchOut based on your Facebook friends and their network. 

By accessing BranchOut with your Facebook log-in credentials, you are authorizing BranchOut to collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, any and all information that you agreed that Facebook could provide to BranchOut. You may also grant us additional permissions at other times. Information is provided to us by Facebook under the terms of Facebook's data use policy (or other applicable Facebook policy).

BranchOut will access and store certain information from your current Facebook profile (for example, your first and last name, email address, current city and state, your work history and education, your profile picture, your Facebook user ID number and demographic information, such as your age and gender, as well as other information that you have made public on Facebook), all in accordance with the permissions you have granted BranchOut. We also access your friends' and their friends' names and applicable user ID number, profile photos, work history and education so that you can create and build your professional network.

In order to help you instantly build your professional network, BranchOut will continue to update your network of friends and their friends, but the rest of your BranchOut profile will not change if you change your Facebook profile.

  2. **Information We Collect From You Directly**

In addition to the information we receive from Facebook, when you use the BranchOut Services, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you as a specific individual ("Personal Information"), and other information about you, such as demographic information (your gender, ZIP code or similar information), registration and payment information (typically, credit card account information), and certain information about your preferences and interests. If we combine demographic, or similar information with the Personal Information we collect, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.

The BranchOut Services are not intended for children younger than the age of 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from children younger than the age of 13, we will take reasonable measures to delete such information from our records.

  3. **Your BranchOut Profile**

Your BranchOut Profile consists of information provided by you or that you have allowed us to access through your Facebook account. Your BranchOut Profile is visible to all BranchOut Users.

  4. **Information Collected Automatically When You Interact**

In addition, Usage Information also includes your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for any computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a "Device") you may use to access the BranchOut Services.

If you use the BranchOut Services on a mobile device, we may also receive information about your mobile device, such as your UDID, mobile operating system, the name of your mobile carrier, and your location information (e.g., GPS coordinates or network-based location).

The methods we may use to collect Usage Information include the following:

BranchOut may offer you the ability to import your professional information from your resume or through third party services so that you can display such information in your BranchOut Profile. Any information that you choose to import will become part of your BranchOut Profile. BranchOut may also offer the ability to help you import your contacts to the BranchOut Services, for instance, by asking for your login information for your email account.

In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of Facebook give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through Facebook, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service.

We also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods you have requested. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the BranchOut Services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.
