If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy, you should first contact us at spinfo@SuperMedia.com. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or if your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php.

This Privacy Policy will change also, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of use. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the version of the Privacy Policy containing such changes on This Website.

• Anonymous statistics collected as you browse the site

• Non-Personally identifiable information you knowingly Provide 

Please be assured that we do not collect personal information about you from the Web site unless you provide it to us. This means that you can visit our Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself (such as your e-mail address).   
You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide.

As you browse the site, our web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via web server logs, we monitor statistics such as: 

  * How many people visit our site 
  * Which pages people visit on our site 
  * From which domains our visitors come (e.g., aol.com) 
  * Which browsers people use to visit our site 



None of this information is associated with you as an individual (see information about cookies below). We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make the Web site easier for you and other visitors to use.   
What about pages that ask for personal information?

When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific purpose, we use the information for that purpose (such as to provide the service or information the visitor has requested). For example, you may be asked to give us individual information to purchase a product or service, receive information and manage online account registration. The information may include your zip code, phone number, account number, billing account number, a credit card number, mother's maiden name, e-mail address, organization URL, personal ID, password, security question & answer, registration code and mailing address. 

  
If you choose to use our Chat feature to receive online support, we may collect your email address, phone number, address, account number and/or customer number and any information you choose to submit that would allow us to resolve your issue. We would respond to you via the Live Chat dialogue box or via email depending on the issue and length of time required to resolve your concern.

A cookie is a small, encrypted data string our server writes to your hard drive that contains your unique User ID for our Web site. Cookies help us to identify returning visitors to our Web site, which allows us to give you a more personalized, useful experience on our Web site.

Users are free to delete Web site cookies. Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. To disable cookies, see "Setting Cookie Preferences" at the end of this policy. 

However, some Web sites and ad serving companies have the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion. If you reenter the same site on another occasion, or enter some other site tracked by the ad serving company/network, and specifically provide personal data.

To do so, you must either continue to decline cookies each time you reenter the site to keep the tracking severed or disable cookies for the new browser session. Users who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their browser advise them each time a Web site attempts to send a cookie to their system.

What security measures are in place to restrict access to personal data?**   
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

  
There are a variety of security measures in place that limit internal access to data stored by This Website. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only and requires an employee to have a secure ID and password to access the information. In addition, logs are reviewed regularly to spot any inconsistencies. The Web site is continually updated with the latest known security patches that are periodically published by our system vendor. Any information that you give is password protected. For your protection, the system automatically locks out a user after 3 incorrect tries and after 20 minutes of idle time per secure session. If you forget your password, you will be prompted to supply your customer ID number and your password will be e-mailed to you. 

  
If you have any questions about security on This Website, you can send us an email at spinfo@SuperMedia.com or contact Client Care at 1- 800-555-4833, Monday-Friday, 7am to 8pm CST.
