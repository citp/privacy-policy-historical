## Privacy Statement

## Live Nation.

This website is owned and operated by Live Nation, Inc. ("Live Nation", "we", "us"). Your privacy is important to Live Nation. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personally identifiable information (such as email address, home address, or telephone number) and other information (such as cookies and log files that, when linked to your name or contact information, allows us to personalize your visit) that we gather while you are visiting the LiveNation.com site (the "Site"), as well as ways in which we process and disseminate such information. This privacy policy does not pertain to information collected on any other site owned by Live Nation, its subsidiaries or other businesses. You are, of course, free to use much of the Site without providing any personally identifiable information to us.

Live Nation reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of this Privacy Policy. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted here, and we encourage you to check back from time to time to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version of our Privacy Policy. At the top of this page, we will indicate the "Effective Date" of the most recent version of the Privacy Policy; this will allow you to determine whether the Privacy Policy has been revised since your previous visit to the Site. Please read this Privacy Policy as well as this Site's Terms of Use carefully. Your use of this Site constitutes your acceptance to be bound by this statement and the Site's Terms of Use without limitation, qualification or change. If at any time you do not accept all the terms and conditions contained herein and in the Terms of Use, you must immediately discontinue use of this Site.

What Information We Collect.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

IP Protocol Addresses and Web Logs

This Site’s web servers automatically collect the Internet Protocol addresses and log files, but not the email addresses, of visitors. This information is generally non-personally identifiable.

Cookies

This Site may use a standard technology called a "cookie", or web beacons or other similar technology to collect information about how you use the Site. Cookies reside on your computer and help the Site recognize your computer's browser as a previous visitor. In addition, on occasion our site may also set a "session cookie" which helps us administer the Site. The session cookie expires when you close your browser and does not retain any information about you after it expires.

We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The type of information we collect includes Internet Protocol addresses and log files.

Personally Identifiable Information.

Special Services

Although you may use many features of this Site without completing a registration or sign-up form, visitors who do register and/or sign up for special services may have access to additional features of the Site and are more likely to receive information suited to their interests. For example, when registration is offered, a registered user is eligible for additional services provided by this Site such as concert updates, chat room forums and/or personalized content. Our registration and special services sign-up forms may ask you for personally identifiable information (like your name or email address) and demographic information (like zip code, age or genre preferences). You must provide the requested information in order to receive the benefits of registration or of the special service.

Additionally, Live Nation affiliates or third parties (such as our Site advertisers and e-commerce partners) may provide Live Nation with personally identifiable information about you, which was not collected on the Site, and we may add such data to your membership information.

How We Use Information We Collect.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

We may use non-personally identifiable information to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Site and pages viewed as well as to diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Site. We may then use this information to analyze and improve the features and functionality of this Site. We may use information about you and other Site visitors on an aggregate basis to sell and deliver advertising, promotions and content that we believe will be of interest to you. In addition, we may share information with advertisers or other third parties that are not part of the Live Nation family on an aggregate or other basis that does not disclose your identity or contact information. Please note that we also may match non-personally identifiable information, such as your IP address, to your personally identifiable information in order to augment our ability to administer the site and create a more enjoyable experience for you. We will not include any such personally identifiable information in the statistical data we provide to advertising partners, unless you have consented to such disclosure or unless otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy.

We use cookies to allow us to customize delivery of information on and through the Site. For example, this Site may use cookies to save and remember registration information or preferences that you may have set while browsing the Site, to keep track of your shopping cart when making any purchases, to ensure you don’t see the same ad content repeatedly, to deliver content specific to your interests, and to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site.

If you use a standard web browser, you should be able to modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies; for example, you should have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may be unable to use certain Site services (e.g., those services that require you to log on to the Site in order to participate). For more information on modifying your browser preference, please refer to the documentation accompanying your browser.

Third Party Advertising

The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visits to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you.

Third Party Cookies

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. For more information about DoubleClick, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please click here <http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/> .

By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our reporting company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of our ability to analyze such data by visiting our Feedback Page <http://www.livenation.com/feedback/> to send us an email with your request.

The Site may contain links to other Internet websites, which may or may not be owned or operated by Live Nation. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of websites that are not owned and operated by Live Nation, including such sites' use of any information (such as IP number, browser type or operating system) collected when visitors to the Site click through links to those sites. Even though such information might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of those sites.

Personally Identifiable Information

a. Site: We may use personally identifiable information you give us to better tailor your website experience to your interests, and to send you information about Live Nation and its services as well as promotional material on behalf of some of our partners. We use other personally identifiable information that you provide to us to show you content in which you may be interested and to display the content according to your preferences. We will also share this information within the Live Nation business family in order to enhance your experience on this and other Live Nation websites.

b. Venues: We may share your email address with Live Nation owned, operated or managed venues where Live Nation produced events occur; with promoters or sponsors of Live Nation events, and with other Live Nation companies. The Live Nation venue, promoter, sponsor, Live Nation company or third party may send you announcements and notifications of events, products or services that might be of interest to you. These announcements may include gift certificates, sweepstakes, contests, promotions, giveaways and merchandise offerings.

From time to time we enter into special relationships with other companies to provide additional features at this Site. These special relationships may include "powered by" partners, business partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as "co-branded pages"). These might include, for example, pages that share our name and that of another entity, such as Ticketmaster. You should look for a specific privacy policy on any such co-branded page. Any personal information that you provide when signing up at any co-branded page may be shared with our third party partner. With respect to specific registration modules, like sweepstakes and contests, we may disclose personally identifiable information collected with any third party sponsor of such promotion, and we will post a conspicuous statement on the registration module to the effect that we will be disclosing the information collected with third parties. You should check our posted partner's and sponsors' website for information regarding their privacy policies.

c. Banner Ads. Live Nation sometimes uses individual data collected via the Site to "target" advertising - to decide which advertisements and sponsor messages to show to which members. As an example, if a certain advertiser wishes to display its advertising only to Site members that are 16 years old, Live Nation uses member registration data to ensure that such advertiser's ads are displayed only to such members. We license ad-server software from another company to place banner advertising on this Site. All of the data provided and generated by the ad-server software remains in our possession and no data is transferred to the licensor of the software. This feature of our Site may, on occasion, set "cookies" on your computer. Any information collected or stored by the ad-service or the cookies is treated in the same manner as other information as described in this statement.

d. Administrative Matters: Live Nation reserves the right to contact you in the event of a change in the Site’s Terms of Use and/or this Privacy Policy, or to notify you of other administrative matters in connection with the Site (e.g., contacting you to facilitate, complete or confirm a transaction).

e. Transactions With E-Commerce Partners, Vendors and Advertisers: When you provide personally identifiable financial information and other personally identifiable information to one of our Site’s e-commerce partners, vendors or advertisers, this transaction will occur in connection with the site of the e-commerce partner, vendor or advertiser, not on the Site, and, as such, the financial and other personally identifiable information you provide is collected pursuant to and controlled by the privacy policy of such e-commerce partner, vendor or advertiser. Live Nation is not responsible for such parties' privacy policies and we encourage you to familiarize yourself with the applicable privacy policy of the e-commerce site with which you transact business or to contact the operator of such site for more information.

Please be aware that at times, at the request of or on behalf of our e-commerce partners, vendors or advertisers, Live Nation may "pre-populate" forms with your personally identifiable data for your review, and, if you so choose, for submission to such e-commerce partners, vendors or advertisers; at other times, forms are pre-populated with your personally identifiable information in order to facilitate a transaction between you and Live Nation with no such personally identifiable information being transmitted to Live Nation partners, vendors or advertisers upon submission of such form. Accordingly, we encourage you to review each pre-populated form carefully before agreeing to submit your information to determine who is seeking to collect your information, and to familiarize yourself with the applicable privacy policy governing use of any personally identifiable information collected about you.

f. Shopping/Commercial Services: This Site may offer merchandise and/or ticket purchase services, which may be offered by us or by a firm that operates a store under contract with us. If our site offers shopping or other commercial services, you will use a customer order form to request information, products, and services. The order form will ask you to give us personally identifiable information (like name, address and/or email address, mobile phone number), financial information (like account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like zip code or age). We will use your mailing address to fulfill orders of merchandise and tickets as well as to send you announcements and notifications that may be of interest to you. We will use the financial information that you provide to bill you for products and services. By giving our site your credit card and related personal information, you are authorizing us to give that information to the merchant and credit card company in order to confirm and fulfill your order. We may use your email address or mobile telephone number’s messaging capability to send you special announcements or notifications of events or services that may be of interest to you and to verify and authorize the use of your credit card for services for which you have registered or requested.

g. Live Nation Employees, Contractors and Agents: Live Nation may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as processing of payments, operating features of the Site, or hosting or maintaining our servers. These other companies may have access to your personal information as necessary to carry out their functions, but, absent your consent, they are not permitted to share that information with any third party (other than as necessary to perform their duties).

h. Online Surveys/Sweepstakes and Contests: From time to time, we conduct online surveys and offer online sweepstakes or contests on the Site. These will ask you for your personally identifiable information (like name or email address) and demographic information (like zip code or age), as well as any other contact information necessary (like a physical address) for us to provide notifications or deliver requested materials related to the survey, sweepstakes or contest. We may use this information from our surveys, sweepstakes and contests to provide you with information about our company and promotional material on behalf of some of our partners, and to contact you when necessary. Please note that we may post relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration area for the sweepstakes or contest. That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, will govern that particular sweepstakes or contest.

i. "Email This to a Friend": The Site may allow you to forward certain items posted on Site or links to other Site features by email or Instant Messenger to other parties who you believe may be interested. While, due to technical restrictions, the recipient's email address or Instant Messenger screen names may be retained in our log files, we do not knowingly share it with third parties (unless the recipient has already consented to such use of his/her personally identifiable information).

j. Public Forums and Other Interactive Features: Because Live Nation reserves the right to use content created or provided by you in connection with our chat room, forum, message board or news groups, to the extent that you include personally identifiable information in such content, Live Nation may republish such personally identifiable information, as part of the content, in connection with the Site and promotion thereof. If we republish your content, we may provide authorship credit by listing your member name as well. Please be aware that when you disclose personally identifiable information in a chat room, forum, message board or news groups on the Site, the information may become public and accessible to all or a part of the Site community, so it is important for you to exercise discretion and appropriate caution when deciding to reveal personal information in these areas. For example, your e-mail address may be available to other Site members, who may send unsolicited e-mail to you. In the event that you encounter any Site user who you believe is improperly collecting or using information about you or other users, please visit our Feedback Page <http://www.livenation.com/feedback/> to send us an email with your request.

k. Compliance With Applicable Law. Live Nation may also access and disclose personally identifiable information in the event that we believe, in Live Nation's discretion, that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with government requests; to enforce the Terms of Use or other published guidelines; to protect Live Nation, its users or others; to respond to circumstances that we feel constitute an emergency; or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law. Please be aware that, in connection with the foregoing, Live Nation may provide information about you gathered through other sites controlled, owned or operated by Live Nation or Live Nation affiliates to the extent permitted under the applicable privacy policy governing collection and use of such information.

l. Opt-In/Opt-Out Policy: When you become a Site member or otherwise supply Live Nation with personally identifiable information in connection with the Site, or from time-to-time in Live Nation's discretion, you may be asked to indicate whether you are interested in receiving information from us about special offers in connection with the Site, Live Nation and/or our advertisers and partners. You will also be provided with the opportunity to opt-in to receiving offers directly from our third-party advertisers or partners. If you do choose to opt-in, you will receive such communications in accordance with your "opt-in" consent. You may, of course, choose not to receive offers or other marketing communications from us or our third-party advertisers or partners as follows:

* Upon becoming a Site member, you can choose to receive no marketing communications from us. Please be aware, however, that, even under this option, you may still receive an initial member welcome message, as well as communications as appropriate to inform you of changes to the Site, this Privacy Policy or other administrative matters.   
* At any time, you can follow a link provided in our newsletters or commercial email messages (but excluding e-commerce confirmations and other administrative emails) to unsubscribe from that particular mailing list or email service.   
* You can have your contact preference changed to "Do Not Contact Me" at any time by using the "Ask a Question" tab on our Feedback Page <http://www.livenation.com/feedback> .   
* You can opt out of having your personally identifiable information shared with our affiliates for their direct marketing purposes at any time by using the "Ask a Question" tab on our Feedback Page <http://www.livenation.com/feedback> . 

If you decide to contact us to change your contact preference to "Do Not Contact Me", Live Nation will implement this change to your Site profile within ten (10) business days of your request. Please be aware that your requested change will not be effective until Live Nation implements such change and that such requests will be implemented only in connection with your Site profile, and will not impact any preferences you may have made to any other site controlled, owned or operated by Live Nation or its affiliates. In addition, please keep in mind that even if you opt-out from receiving communications from the Site, residual information about you will remain within Live Nation databases, access logs and other records, which may or may not contain such personally identifiable information. The residual information will not be used for commercial purposes; however, Live Nation reserves the right, from time to time, to recontact former customers or users of the Site for administrative purposes or in order to comply with applicable law.

If you opt-in to the disclosure of your personally identifiable information to third parties, and you subsequently decide that you would like to discontinue receiving offers and other promotional materials from such third parties, you may need to contact those third parties directly in order to opt-out of further communications.

Please note that Live Nation reserves the right to change its opt-in/opt-out practices by modifying or updating this Privacy Policy as set forth above.

The nature of some features of our Site may require that we share personally identifiable information about you with persons or companies outside of the Live Nation family. For example, this may occur at a feature that enables you, via our Site, to ask questions of persons or entities that are not part of the Live Nation family. By responding to those features of the site, whether by email or direct entry of information on the Site, you are consenting to our transferring that information to such persons or entities.

Policy Regarding Health-Related Personal Information

The Site may request certain health-related information in certain areas of its Site (e.g., regarding physically disabled seating requests). Such information (to the extent it includes personally identifiable information) will be treated like all other non-health-related personally identifiable information under this Privacy Policy, and is subject to the opt in/opt out provisions described above.

Children’s Personal Information

Consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act:

This Site does NOT collect, use, or disclose personal information (including online contact information) of children under the age of 13. In the event that a child under the age of 13 attempts to register or make a purchase on our Site, we will NOT accept the registration and will delete information received from the child. In the event that a child posts personal information in a public forum such as a chat room, we will attempt to delete that information once we become aware of it.

Accessing, Updating or Deleting Information Collected About You

This Site also gives you the opportunity to modify or remove personally identifiable information that you have provided to us by way of this Site. You may do so by modifying your password-protected registered user information on the site. To the extent that such information is stored in our databases, we will respond to your changes immediately, although please understand that although this information, once deleted, is not available on the Site, that information may remain stored indefinitely in our backup and archival records. However, to the extent that such information is not stored in our databases, we cannot always ensure that these corrections or deletions will immediately reach such other databases.

Security of Your Personal Information.

Live Nation employs reasonable security measures consistent with standard industry practice, for information collected through this Site. We believe that we have adequate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information we collect on the Site. We also use internal protections to limit access to users’ personal information to only those employees who need the information to perform a specific job. We cannot, however, guarantee that information supplied by users will not be accessed on our servers, or intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. If you have reason to believe that there has been any breach of the security of the Site, please contact us at privacy@livenation.com.

Please remember that security of the username and password you create when you register with the Site, is your responsibility; we recommend that you do not share them with anyone. If you share your username and password, you are providing access to your personal information. You will be responsible for all uses of your registration, whether or not authorized by you. You agree to immediately notify Live Nation of any unauthorized use of your username or password.

Sale or Merger.

If this site is sold to, or merges with, another company not owned by Live Nation, you should expect that some or all of the information collected from the Site may be transferred to the buyer/surviving company. If so, Live Nation will seek to obligate the acquiring company to use any personal information transferred by this site in a manner consistent with this statement, but cannot guarantee that it will be able to impose that requirement or that the acquiring company will comply.

Former Owner

We note that the Site was previously owned by Clear Channel. We are not responsible for compliance with privacy or other obligations that you believe Clear Channel or any other former owners may have to you.

Offline vs. Online practices

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies solely to our online information gathering and dissemination practices in connection with the Site, and does not apply to any of our practices conducted offline, with the following exception: In the event Live Nation merges information collected about you through offline means with data about you that is collected online and is stored in our databases, the use of the merged data will be subject to this Privacy Policy.
