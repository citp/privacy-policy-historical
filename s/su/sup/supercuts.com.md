# Privacy Policy

The Information We Collect

  
The information we collect when you visit our website depends on what you do when you visit. If you read or download information, we collect and store only the following: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account); the date and time; and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site (if applicable). We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site and to help us make our site more useful. We may share such user information with partners, advertisers and others but only in aggregate form, not in a manner that would allow personal identification of a specific user. If you visit our site and make requests, register to receive materials, apply for employment, or participate in our reminder services, the types of personal information collected are the following: your name, your address, your e-mail address, your phone number and any other information you submit. If you participate in an online survey or questionnaire, any information you provide will also be maintained.

  
How We Use Information  
From time to time, we may send offers and/or information from our salons to addresses provided. We only share personally identifiable information provided by you with third parties outside of Regis Corp. with your permission. By opting to a Regis Corp. mailing list, we assume that you have given permission for Regis Corp. to share this information with third parties. We always provide you an opportunity to opt-out of our mailing lists, prohibiting any further sharing of your information (except when we believe the law requires us to disclose it or when the disclosure is necessary to protect the rights or property of Regis Corp.).

Mobile Privacy Policy  
You may decide to have promotional text messages sent directly to your mobile device. This program is completely voluntary, and messages will be sent to you only if you have opted in to receive them.

If you have errantly received a marketing text message without opting in to the program, or if you wish to opt out of receiving text messages, you can remove yourself from the program by either texting "STOP" to 44218; or contacting Customer Service by email at [DEPARTMENTCS@REGISCORP.COM](mailto:DEPARTMENTCS@REGISCORP.COM) or by phone at 1.888.456.2887.**

  
**You will need to provide your mobile phone number in order to be removed from the program. It may take up to 10 days to process your stop request. You may receive additional text messages from Supercuts during this time.  
Supercuts respects your privacy and will never sell or share your mobile number. Supercuts and its third party marketing partner administering this program on Supercuts' behalf will only use your mobile number in conjunction with this mobile alerts program.
