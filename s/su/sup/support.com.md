# Services Privacy Policy

Support.com respects your privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of your Personal Information that you may submit to us by telephone, our support web site located at www.Support.com ("Site") or during the performance of the remote computer support services provided via telephone or online via the Site ("Services") by Support.com, Inc., its subsidiaries and contractors ("Support.com," "We" or "Us"). "Personal Information" is information that (i) is recorded in any form; (ii) is about you, or pertains to you; and (iii) can be linked to you. Personal Information includes information like your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and non-public information that is associated with the foregoing. Personal Information does not include information that pertains to you, but cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. Support.com has created this policy to inform you how your Personal Information will be treated if you use the Site or our Services. In general, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personally identifiable information from you.

Support.com voluntarily adheres to the "Safe Harbor" framework concerning the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States. Accordingly, we follow the Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Principles") with respect to all such data. The Principles can be found at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>. If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy ("Policy") and the Principles, the Principles will govern.

##  Consent

FOR THOSE OF YOU VISITING US FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, CANADA, OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU ENTER WILL BE TRANSFERRED OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION OR YOUR HOME COUNTRY FOR USE BY SUPPORT.COM AND ITS AFFILIATES FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED IN THIS POLICY. YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED AND STORED IN THE UNITED STATES, AND AS A RESULT, GOVERNMENTS, COURTS, OR LAW ENFORCEMENT OR REGULATORY AGENCIES MAY BE ABLE TO OBTAIN DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION THROUGH LAWS APPLICABLE IN THE UNITED STATES. BY USING OUR SITE AND PROVIDING US WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOU CONSENT TO THIS TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.

##  Collection of Personal Information

The Personal Information we gather from you helps us learn more about the visitors of our Site and users of our Services. We may collect information that you voluntarily submit to us, including the following Personal Information:

  * To create an account for our Services, you must provide Support.com with a valid e-mail address and a password of your choice. You may also provide us with your telephone number.

You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Services you are able to use.

##  Use of Cookies

We use cookies to personalize your visit to the Site and your use of the Services. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent storage of the information. Please note that if you set your browser to not accept cookies, you may not be able to fully view or use all parts of the Site and your use of the Services might be limited.

##  Site Navigation

We use tools to analyze traffic patterns and inform us how visitors are using the Site and how successfully we are marketing our Services. We log your Internet (IP) address to give us an idea of which parts of our Site you visit and how long you spend there. We also collect the Internet address from which you arrived on our Site (if any) and the Internet browser you are using to visit our Site. We may rely on third party service providers to collect and analze this information for us.

##  System Data Collection, Remote Control and Utilities

Our Services help diagnose and resolve technology problems that you may have. Support.com uses several types of software: the first type provides computer system information to Support.com which helps us to identify, diagnose and resolve the technology problem that you have encountered and/or problems that may arise in the future, the second type allows Support.com to remotely control your computer and modify its settings or software in our attempt to solve your technology problem, and the third type generally consists of utilities and other tools to improve computer performance and help solve your personal technology problem as described in our Terms of Service. By ordering our Services, you are giving express permission to Support.com to download and use the software described above (the "Support.com Software"). Depending on the Services that you order, the Support.com Software may allow us to temporarily take control of your computer and modify your computer settings to resolve your personal technology problem. For other Services, the Support.com Software will report non-personal information about your computer's performance and configuration to you and to Support.com. For such Services, the Support.com Software will run on a regular basis, but only after you elect to run the Support.com Software and report your computer information to yourself and to Support.com. In every instance, Support.com will solely use the Support.com Software and the information that it provides to attempt to identify and resolve your existing and potential personal technology problem(s) and use reasonable efforts to limit its access of your Personal Information while performing the Services and only after you have given us permission to do so. However, in the course of providing the Services to you, Support.com may inadvertently see, access, or be exposed to Personal Information on your computer. You are responsible for and Support.com has no liability for securing and backing up your computer network, all information stored on your computer and all software on your computer. Please see our Terms of Service for more information.

##  Monitoring of the Services

Support.com has the right, but no obligation, to monitor and record the performance of the Services, including telephone calls and online sessions with the Support.com Software and you hereby acknowledge and agree to such activities. Support.com may use the data collected during such recordings for purposes of improving customer service, internal training, and internal market research and will handle such data as described in the previous paragraph with respect to Personal Information that may be contained in such data. Solely with respect to Services recordings that do not contain Personal Information, Support.com may use such recordings or extracts from such recordings to promote and market the Services, provided that Support.com will not use or disclose any audio recording elements in any external marketing or promotion without your specific prior consent to do so. Support.com will delete recordings after a reasonable amount of time.

##  Use of Personal Information

In general, Personal Information is used by us (i) to register you for our Services, (ii) to respond to your requests and provide the Services to you, (iii) to improve the features, performance and support of the Services, and (iv) to offer you additional information, opportunities, and functionality. We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails, should you request to receive such communications from us.

Support.com personnel and any third party contractors working for or with Support.com in providing the Service only get access to any of the customer information (including any Personal Information therein) on a need-to-know basis and are under contractual obligations to keep the confidentiality of such information.

Support.com may also collect and create aggregate information about customers, sales, traffic patterns, and data about our services and systems, and use such information internally to improve the Services, for training, for marketing and promotional purposes, and for other business purposes, and we may provide it to third parties at our discretion, but this aggregate information will not include any Personal Information.

  * the disclosure is to a Support.com subsidiary or affiliate or to business partners or third party contractors providing services on our or your behalf (each a "Transferee"), consistent with the purpose for which the information was obtained, provided the Transferee, with respect to the information in question: 
    * is subject to the 1998 EU Data Protection Directive;
    * has agreed in writing to provide the same level of privacy protection as required by the Principles and/or this Privacy Policy; or

We may employ third party contractors that help us with providing the Services to our customers, including, without limitation, to confirm transactions, process payments, store data, provide telephone support and other features of the Services, or to communicate with our customers. We may share the Personal Information that we collect from you with these third party contractors to the extent necessary for them to perform their services to Support.com, and they may collect information (including Personal Information) from you in connection with providing the Services to the same extent as Support.com may collect information from you under this Privacy Policy. These contractors are only permitted to use such information (including Personal Information) for the purposes of providing services to Support.com and are obligated by the contracts that they have signed with us to use reasonable security measures to protect your Personal Information and to keep your Personal Information confidential.

##  Disclosure to Business Partners

Support.com may also enter into relationships with business partners who may provide services in connection with our Services ("Business Relationships"). You may have become aware of our Services through our business partners, or may have been offered our Services in connection with such Business Relationships, sometimes under the name of our business partners, or on a co-branded website. As part of such Business Relationships, our Services may be provided in connection with the services of one or more of our business partners. To the extent Support.com collects and stores information (including Personal Information) in connection with such Business Relationships, such collection and storing will be done in accordance with this Privacy Policy, unless we, or our business partner(s), inform you otherwise and obtain your consent. It is also possible that we may receive information (including Personal Information) about you in the course of such Business Relationships that was collected by our business partner(s) to enable us to provide our Services to you, in which case we will handle such information as described in this Privacy Policy, but we will have no influence on how the information is handled by our business partners. We may share some of the information we collect in connection with such Business Relationships with our business partners, and these business partners will use and handle such information in accordance with their privacy policy and not the Support.com Privacy Policy. Such sharing will only be done in connection with the respective Business Relationship. Support.com will share only that information necessary for delivery of the Services, unless you have consented to the sharing of your information with the business partner or the jurisdiction in which you receive the Services does not require your consent prior to such transfer.

##  Affiliates; Business Transitions; Necessary Disclosures

We may share some or all of your Personal Information with any parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies (collectively, "Affiliates") under a common control we may have, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.

In the event Support.com goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Support.com or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. You hereby consent to Support.com sharing your Personal Information under the above circumstances.

We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of us, the visitors of our Site and user of our Services, or third parties.

Support.com expressly reserves the right, and in some states may be legally required, to report certain materials, such as, but not limited to, child pornography or terror plans, that we may become aware of in the course of providing the Services to the authorities in charge.

We will send you service-related announcements (such as, but not limited to, notices of any updates to our Services, Terms of Service or Privacy Policy) when it is necessary to do so. You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature, but if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to deactivate your account with us, which involves termination of the Terms of Service.

##  Security of Personal Information

To help protect the privacy of information you transmit through use of the Site and/or Services, Support.com uses industry-standard technology that encrypts information you exchange with us through our Site. In addition, Support.com uses reasonable standard industry practice to protect the information we collect from you against unauthorized access. However, no company, including Support.com, can fully eliminate security risks associated with the handling of information, including Personal Information, over the Internet, and with the storing of such information on servers that are connected with the Internet. If Support.com learns of a security breach that involves your Personal Information and could result in identify theft, we will attempt to notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Services, or providing Personal Information to us through any means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach by mail.

If at any point we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify registered users by way of an e-mail.
