We recognize that when you choose to provide Us with information about yourself, you trust Us to act in a responsible manner. Support.com has created this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) to inform you how your Personal Information will be treated if you use Our websites, software or services. In general, you can visit Our websites without telling Us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.

Support.com’s authorized partners (“Partners”) may use Our software or online services to provide their services to you (“Partner Services”). Partner Services may be governed by the respective Partner’s privacy policy, which terms may differ from this Privacy Policy.

By continuing to use this website, online services, software or remote computer support services after those changes become effective, you consent and agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with Our policies and practices, do not use the website, Our products, software and/or services.

Support.com may also display or provide you with targeted content or promotional offers based on Personal Information; and from time to time We may use Personal Information to offer you products or services. We may also use Personal Information for other business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, fraud monitoring and prevention, developing new products, enhancing, improving or modifying Our services, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of Our promotional campaigns and operating and expanding Our business activities.

For example, Support.com automatically receives and records information on Our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Support.com cookie information, and the webpages you request. This is done as part of regular internet communication between a browser and a website. We use this information to provide the services and functions you request, and to improve Our product and service offerings in the future. We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where We are required to do otherwise under applicable law.
