# Support.com's online Privacy Policy -

**Privacy Policy  
**  
Support.com respects your privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of your Personal Information that you may submit to Us by telephone, when using our websites, online services, software or during the performance of remote computer support services provided via telephone or online by Support.com, Inc., its subsidiaries and contractors (“Support.com”, “We”, “Our” or “Us”). “Personal Information” is information that (i) is recorded in any form; (ii) is about you or pertains to you, and (iii) can be linked to you. Personal Information includes information like your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and non-public information that is associated with the foregoing. Personal Information does not include information We may collect but cannot reasonably be used to identify you, such as how many devices use a particular operating system or how many customers experience a certain kind of technical problem.

We recognize that when you choose to provide Us with information about yourself, you trust Us to act in a responsible manner. Support.com has created this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) to inform you how your Personal Information will be treated if you use Our websites, software or services. In general, you can visit Our websites without telling Us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. It is Our intent to let you know before We collect Personal Information from you.

Support.com’s authorized partners (“Partners”) may use Our software or online services to provide their services to you (“Partner Services”). Partner Services may be governed by the respective Partner’s privacy policy, which terms may differ from this Privacy Policy.

Support.com has received TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and Our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through the support.com website and does not include information collected from Our software or services.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that We have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe at  **<https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>**.

Support.com complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Support.com has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

**Information We Collect and How We Use it**

We collect Personal Information when you subscribe to one of Our newsletters, download a trial version of a product, or receive a product or service from Us or one of Our distribution partners or from a service provider who licenses one of Our remote support systems, such as Support.com® Cloud. The type of information We collect may vary based on the way We interact with you. For example, if you sign up for a newsletter or download an evaluation version of Our software, We may only collect your name and email address. However, if you make a purchase from Us then We may also collect your credit card number over the phone, and we may collect your phone number and physical address in order to complete the purchase, verify your identity and deliver any physical products. We may combine information We have about you with information We obtain from business partners or other companies. Support.com automatically receives and records information on Our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Support.com cookie information, and the webpages you request. This is done as part of regular internet communication between a browser and a website. We use Personal Information and other information collected in this manner to provide you with the products or services you have requested, process any payments you have agreed to for such products and services, contact you regarding specific products or services you have requested, provide other information you have requested from Us, customize advertisements or content you may see while using Our products or services, and, if you have agreed to receive special promotional offers from Us by email or otherwise, to contact you regarding such promotional offers. Support.com may also display or provide you with targeted content or promotional offers based on Personal Information; and from time to time We may use Personal Information to offer you products or services.

During your use of Our website, software and services, Our systems may also collect information from your device and network that is not used to identify you, but is helpful in Our efforts to provide the features or services you have requested. This includes information such as the type of computer and processor you are using, which version of the operating system is installed, the configuration of your computer in terms of other application programs used, your computer’s Media Access Control address, whether any security software is installed and if it is up-to-date, the names, makes and models of other devices on your network, and information on how you use Our products. We use this information to provide the services and functions you request, and to improve Our product and service offerings in the future.
