SMCI's Sites use Cookies. Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website.

Cookies help with a variety of website functions including allowing users to “log in” to websites (making your navigation of websites more efficient), remembering your preferences (such as language), and generally improving your experience on our Sites. Cookies can also help ensure that the advertisements and content you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. We may also include web beacons in marketing e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and links contained within clicked on.

Some of our business partners set web beacons and Cookies on our site.
