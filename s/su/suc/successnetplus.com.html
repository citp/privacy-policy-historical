<p>THIS STATEMENT PROVIDES GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE  PRIVACY POLICY OF THIS WEBSITE.  IF YOU ARE UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE,  PLEASE BE SURE TO READ THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT WITH YOUR PARENTS OR  GUARDIAN AND ASK THEM QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND.</p>
<p>IF  YOU ARE ACCESSING THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT (AS DEFINED BELOW) FROM A  CD-ROM, PLEASE DISREGARD THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT.</p>
<p>This website (the "Site") is made available to you by Pearson  Education, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Pearson").  At  Pearson, we are serious about protecting your privacy, and this privacy  statement (the "Privacy Statement")  discloses how we collect, protect,  use and share the personal information gathered on this Site.</p>
<p>Your  use of this Site is subject to the terms of use (the "Terms of Use")  posted on this website, which includes this Privacy Statement.  The  Terms of Use (including the Privacy Statement) or any part thereof may  be revised by Pearson from time to time, through an updated posting, and  therefore you should check the Terms of Use (including the Privacy  Statement) periodically.  Revisions are effective upon posting and your  continued use of this Site, after the posting of revisions to the Terms  of Use (including the Privacy Statement), will indicate your acceptance  of such revisions.

<p><b class="privacyHeading">WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED</b></p>
<p>We consider the following to be examples of  personally-identifying information:  they include, but are not limited  to, your first and last name, email address, home address, phone number,  date of birth, social security number, credit card information and  certain other information, to the extent it is linked with your  personally-identifying information.</p>
<p>The information we learn from  you helps us personalize and continually improve your experience and use  of this Site, so that we can further serve your needs and our  legitimate business purposes.  (For example, when you send us a message  or make an online purchase or enroll in a marketing promotion, we need  to retain certain personally-identifying information on this Site in  order to respond to your request).  Your personally-identifying  information may be used by our company to help us improve this Site, and  also may be used for our company's marketing and promotional purposes.  We receive and store any information you enter on this Site or give us  in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but  then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.</p>
<p><b class="privacyHeading">PUBLIC POSTINGS</b></p>
<p>Users and especially Children (Children 12 and under) should note  that any personally-identifying information that is voluntarily posted  by a user to any public area of this Site may always be collected and  used by others.  While we monitor such posting areas from time to time  and will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete a Child’s  personally-identifying information prior to posting, we strongly  encourage Children not to post such information.</p>
<p><b class="privacyHeading">INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE.</b></p>
<p>Except as specifically stated in this Privacy Statement, our policy  is not to share this personally-identifying information with third  parties, but we may share this information with affiliates of Pearson,  and other companies and organizations who perform work for us under  contract or sell products or services that complement our products and  services. Information collected through this Site may be supplied to  affiliates of Pearson, and other companies and organizations who perform  work for us under contract or sell products or services that complement  our products and services.  We may also disclose personally-identifying  information in the following situations (a) in response to a subpoena,  court order or legal process, to the extent permitted and required by  law; (b) to protect user security or the security of other persons,  consistent with applicable laws; (c) in connection with a sale, joint  venture or other transfer to some or all of Pearson or the assets of  Pearson; or (d) in order to enforce the Site’s Terms of Use.  We  otherwise exercise commercially reasonable care to not otherwise share  or disclose the names of users or any other personally-identifying  information with third-parties, except with the prior approval of the  user.</p>
<p><b class="privacyHeading">SPECIAL NOTICE TO PARENTS, TEACHERS AND  CHILDREN</b></p>
<p>PARENTS AND TEACHERS: We encourage parents, guardians and teacher  to spend time with their Children or the Children they teach and  participate in the activities that may be offered to Children on this  Site.  No personally-identifying information should be submitted to or  posted on this Site by Children without the consent of their parent,  guardian or teacher. We encourage parents and teachers to monitor  Children’s online use, and to help us protect their privacy by  instructing Children never to provide such information on this Site or  any other website without permission.  We are also prohibited by law  from conditioning a Child’s participation in any activity on this Site  on the Child disclosing more personally-identifying information than is  reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.</p>
<p>CHILDREN: Please do not give your full name, email address, home  address, telephone number or any other personally-identifying  information that would enable someone to contact you either on-line or  off-line, without first asking your parent, guardian or teacher for  permission.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personally-identifying  information from Children on this Site either directly or passively,  except when a Child may voluntarily submit such information through (i) a  "Contact Us" link on a Child’s area of this Site or (ii) a public  posting area, if such feature is available.  If a Child communicates  with us in either manner, and we can identify the sender as a Child, any  personally-identifying information submitted will only be used to  respond on a one-time basis to such Child, and will thereafter be  deleted from our records.  In addition, if we have actual knowledge that  a Child is sending or posting personally-identifying information on any  area of this Site, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to  delete such personally-identifying information before it is made public.   We will never request personally-identifying information from a Child  in any of our public postings areas.  Please note that any online store  that may be accessed from this Site is intended for parents, teachers  and other adult purchasers over the age of 18 and requires the  submission of personally-identifying information to fulfill and service  any transactions.</p>
<p>We may disclose a Child's personally-identifying information  in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this  information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action  against someone who may be causing injury to, or interference with,  (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other  users or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.  We also  may disclose a Child's personally-identifying information when we  believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>
<p><b class="privacyHeading">COOKIES AND COLLECTION AND USE OF  INFORMATION</b></p>
