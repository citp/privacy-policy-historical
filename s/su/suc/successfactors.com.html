<h3>Web Site Data Collection Overview</h3>
<p>Our server software gathers in log files, general demographic information from all users of our Web site and for users of our hosted application service and related support services, general professional information will be stored and processed in connection with their training, performance or career development. For each visitor to the SuccessFactors Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes the visitor's domain name, browser type, operating system, referring domains, entry page, exit page, and average time on the Web site. This information is used for internal purposes only, to help us improve our Web site and better understand our visitors' needs.</p>
<p>We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of marketing companies to help us collect and/or log Internet Protocol addresses, Internet domain names, the web browser and operating system used to access the SuccessFactors Web site, the files visited, the time spent in each file, and the time and date of each visit. We use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing companies. Cookies are identifiers that can be sent from a Web site via your browser to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Thereafter when you visit a Web site, a message is sent back to the Web server by the browser accessing the Web site. You may elect not to accept cookies by changing the designated settings on your Web browser. However, not utilizing cookies may prevent you from using certain functions and features of our Web site. The information collected from the use of cookies is used and analyzed to improve our Web site. We use cookies to personalize the experience of our visitors, provide support to customers, record visitor preferences, provide personalized and specialized content, record session information, track visitor clickstream behavior throughout the Web site, and customize site content based on your browser type, operating system, and preferences. By gathering such information to supplement our records, we learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing companies log the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can opt-out of this Web site analysis tool by disabling your cookies. If you disable your cookies, you may still use our Web site; however, you may not be able to access certain areas within it.</p>
<p>If you choose to receive company or product information, you will need to complete our online request forms. The online forms provide site visitors with an opportunity to request free product downloads and demos, view SuccessFactors white papers, register for free SuccessFactors online seminars, and enroll for various services. These forms require your name, company name, e-mail address, company address, phone number as well as other information to help us determine and respond to your needs related to the products and/or services requested. All information provided by the visitor is voluntary. We use this information to send updates about our company and our products and to contact you if requested or necessary.

Your contact information collected from these contests and promotions may be used to administer the contest and notify winners and contact you when necessary.</p>
<h3>E-mail Addresses</h3>
<p>We do not collect e-mail addresses without the site visitor voluntarily providing us with this information (typically via our online information request form, whitepaper request form, and other Web site forms and surveys). We will periodically use your e-mail information for service, sales, support, and marketing purposes. From time to time, we may share your e-mail address with our partner organizations and companies for service, sales, support, and marketing purposes. If you do not wish to receive marketing e-mail from us or our partners in the future, you may opt out as described below.</p>
<h3>Customer Data</h3>
<p>Customers use our hosted application service to host data about their personnel. We do not use or disclose such data except as provided in our subscription agreements with our customers, or as may be required by law.

<h3>Data Security</h3>
<p>We use a variety of security measures and employ appropriate physical, administrative and technical safeguards to protect against the loss or unauthorized use, alteration or disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, the personal information under our control. We have licensed the industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, which permits encryption of potentially sensitive information such as your name, address and credit card number. This will make your information unusable in the event of unauthorized third-party interception. We store this information in a secure environment at one or more of our service providers. </p>
<p>SuccessFactors personnel with access to this information have been trained and advised of the importance of maintaining the security and confidentiality of such information and of using it only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Other than as expressly described in this Privacy Policy, we will not share personally identifiable information with anyone outside of SuccessFactors without your prior permission unless we believe in good faith that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with applicable law, (ii) enforce the terms of any of our user agreements, or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of SuccessFactors, our visitors, or others.</p>
<p>Upon request submitted to <a href="mailto:info@successfactors.com">info@successfactors.com</a>, SuccessFactors will provide Web site visitors at no cost with access to their personal information that we have on record and the ability to complete, update or remove such information. The SuccessFactors Web site may provide links to third-party Web sites for your convenience and information. If you access those links, you will leave the SuccessFactors Web site. SuccessFactors does not control these third-party sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from SuccessFactors'. We do not endorse or make any representations about third party Web sites. The personal data you choose to give to unrelated third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>In the event your personal information is acquired, or is reasonably believed to have been acquired, by an unauthorized person, and applicable law requires notification to you by SuccessFactors, SuccessFactors will notify you of such breach promptly by email, fax, or U.S. mail, as permitted by law and consistent with the reasonable investigatory needs of law enforcement and/or SuccessFactors.</p>
<h3>Notification of Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>SuccessFactors may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If SuccessFactors decides to make material changes in the way we use your personal information, we will post the changes on this page so that you always will know what information we collect, how it is used, and when and how it will be disclosed. Your use of the SuccessFactors Web site following notice of such change will be deemed acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy, which may include application of the new policy to information provided prior to the date of such change.</p>
