## Cookies & Other Tools

Our Site uses cookies to identify you so you don't need to log in each time you visit our Site. The cookies are linked to your customer identifier, which is associated with the information in your account. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site and applications, but your ability to use some features or areas may be limited.

Within our Site we and our partners, affiliates, and/or analytics or service providers use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts to analyze trends, administer the Site, track visitors' movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our visitor base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual or aggregated basis.

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and/or clickstream data. We use this information gathered about you from our Site to help personalize search results, diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Site. We also gather broad demographic information from this data to help us improve our Site and make your browsing and purchasing experience more enjoyable. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information, except as necessary to prevent fraud or abuse on our system.

We also use tracking technologies such as: CI codes (click tracking), ISC (source tracking), and ITC (item tracking codes, attached to purchases at an item level, used to determine where within the application a product was added). We report this data back to our Sucuri web services. These results are not shared with any third parties and are used solely for deciding when to retire SDKs/OS versions and to identify characteristics of major visitors so that we may optimize our applications and services for those visitor types.

You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and you can refuse it; this may, however, reduce functionality of certain Site features.

## Geolocation Data

With your express consent, we may access and track location data from your mobile device in order to personalize results or other content. We do not tie any personally identifiable information about you to any of the location tracking technologies that we use.

## Targeted Advertisements

Absent any instructions from you, Sucuri may use information you provide to inform you about additional services and products offered by Sucuri’s affiliates, Sucuri venture companies, Sucuri authorized agents, and, where you have consented or where permitted under applicable law, other goods and services providers with whom Sucuri has relationships and whose offerings might be of interest to you. Sucuri and our third party partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/), or if located in the European Union click [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.

## Supplementation of Information

In order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the information you submit to us with information from third party sources (e.g., information from our strategic partners, service providers, or the United States Postal Service). We do this to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our products and services to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.

## Security

The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. Even though we take precautions to protect information, no security measures can be 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information. If you have any questions about the security of your personally identifiable information, you can contact us at [privacy@sucuri.net](mailto:privacy@sucuri.net).

## Do Not Track Disclosures

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that visitors can set in their web browsers. When a visitor turns on DNT, the browser sends a message to websites requesting that they don’t track the visitor. Currently, there is no standardized way to respond to such signals, and we do not respond to such signals at this time. For information about DNT, visit [www.allaboutdnt.org](http://www.allaboutdnt.org/)

## Data Retention

We may retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## Visitor Consent

Information that you disclose in a public space, including on any blog, bulletin board, chat room, or website Sucuri may host for you as part of your Sucuri services, is available to anyone else who visits that space. Sucuri cannot safeguard any information you disclose in these locations.

If you voluntarily offer any feedback, data, answers, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas or the like, Sucuri will treat that portion of the information as non-confidential and nonproprietary and, except as otherwise expressed in this Policy, Sucuri assumes no obligation to protect such information from disclosure. To request removal of your personally identifiable information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [privacy@sucuri.net](mailto:privacy@sucuri.net). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personally identifiable information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

## Third Party Sites

Additionally, the Sucuri Site contains links to sites that belong to third parties unrelated to Sucuri. Sucuri cannot protect any information you may disclose in these sites and recommends that you review the privacy policy statements of those sites you visit.

## Transborder Transfer

If you are visiting this Site from a country other than the country in which our servers are located, your communications with us may result in the transfer of information across international boundaries.
