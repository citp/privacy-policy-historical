We receive and store any information you enter on this Site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.

**PUBLIC POSTINGS**

Users and especially Children (Children 12 and under) should note that any personally-identifying information that is voluntarily posted by a user to any public area of this Site may always be collected and used by others. While we monitor such posting areas from time to time and will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete a Child’s personally-identifying information prior to posting, we strongly encourage Children not to post such information.

**INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE.**

Except as specifically stated in this Privacy Statement, our policy is not to share this personally-identifying information with third parties, but we may share this information with affiliates of Pearson, and other companies and organizations who perform work for us under contract or sell products or services that complement our products and services.

We otherwise exercise commercially reasonable care to not otherwise share or disclose the names of users or any other personally-identifying information with third-parties, except with the prior approval of the user.

**SPECIAL NOTICE TO PARENTS, TEACHERS AND CHILDREN**

PARENTS AND TEACHERS: We encourage parents, guardians and teacher to spend time with their Children or the Children they teach and participate in the activities that may be offered to Children on this Site. No personally-identifying information should be submitted to or posted on this Site by Children without the consent of their parent, guardian or teacher. We encourage parents and teachers to monitor Children’s online use, and to help us protect their privacy by instructing Children never to provide such information on this Site or any other website without permission. We are also prohibited by law from conditioning a Child’s participation in any activity on this Site on the Child disclosing more personally-identifying information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.

CHILDREN: Please do not give your full name, email address, home address, telephone number or any other personally-identifying information that would enable someone to contact you either on-line or off-line, without first asking your parent, guardian or teacher for permission.

We do not knowingly collect personally-identifying information from Children on this Site either directly or passively, except when a Child may voluntarily submit such information through (i) a "Contact Us" link on a Child’s area of this Site or (ii) a public posting area, if such feature is available. If a Child communicates with us in either manner, and we can identify the sender as a Child, any personally-identifying information submitted will only be used to respond on a one-time basis to such Child, and will thereafter be deleted from our records. In addition, if we have actual knowledge that a Child is sending or posting personally-identifying information on any area of this Site, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such personally-identifying information before it is made public. We will never request personally-identifying information from a Child in any of our public postings areas. Please note that any online store that may be accessed from this Site is intended for parents, teachers and other adult purchasers over the age of 18 and requires the submission of personally-identifying information to fulfill and service any transactions.

We may disclose a Child's personally-identifying information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to, or interference with, (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We also may disclose a Child's personally-identifying information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
