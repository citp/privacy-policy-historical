        We at Sulia take your privacy very seriously. This Privacy Policy covers the
        treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personally Identifiable
        Information”) that you provide to us and that is gathered and shared when
        you are using or accessing Sulia. &nbsp;Please read this notice carefully.
    </p><p>
        If you have any questions on this policy, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:support@sulia.com">support@sulia.com</a></p><h2>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2><p>
        This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that
        we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party
        websites, content sources, services and applications (“Third Party
        Services”) that you elect to access through Sulia, or to individuals that
        we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to
        those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we
        cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those
        Third Party Services.
    </p><p>
        In connection with your use of Sulia, we receive information about you from
        various sources, including: (i) through your Sulia user account (your
        “Account”); (ii) your use of Sulia generally; and (iii) from Third Party
        Services to which you elect to connect. When you use Sulia, you are
        consenting to the collection, transfer, storage, disclosure and other uses
        of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p><h2>Information Collected and Used by Sulia.</h2><p>
        The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and operate
        Sulia. We collect and use the following types of information from our users.
    </p><p><strong>Sign-In Information:</strong></p><p>
        When you  create an Account with Sulia, you will provide information that
        could include Personally Identifiable Information, such as your username,
        password and email address. This information may be personal to you, and by
        creating an Account with Sulia and providing Personally Identifiable
        Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you through
        the information on your profile page. We may use your contact information
        to send you information about Sulia. You may unsubscribe from most of these
        messages through your Account settings, although we regardless reserve the
        right to contact you when we believe it is necessary, such as for account
        recovery purposes.
    </p><p><strong>User Content:</strong></p><p>
        Sulia is a public forum, where users can share information and interact
        about topics of interest; therefore, most of the information posted through
        Sulia is public by default.
    </p><p>
        We allow you to submit content to Sulia, such as the ability to create,
        curate, and distribute collections of content and uniform resource locators
        (“URLs”), written descriptions of content or URLs, comments, text, images
        and video. As a feature of Sulia, we collect and store that information.
    </p><p>
        Personally Identifiable Information, such as your username and avatar, will
        potentially be included along with what you post and share but only to the
        extent that you decide to post.
    </p><p><strong>IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:</strong></p><p>
        We gather information from the Sulia application or your web browser when
        you interact with Sulia, such as (i) the IP address and physical location
        of the devices accessing Sulia; (ii) the time and date of each access; and
        (iii) information about sharing of content. While we collect and store this
        information, it is not made public. We do at times, however, share some of
        this information with our partners, service providers and other persons
        with whom we conduct business, but such information cannot feasibly be
        linked to you individually.
    </p><p><strong>Information Collected Using Cookies:</strong></p><p>
        Sulia takes your privacy very seriously.&nbsp; We use cookies in industry
        standard ways to improve your experience and to improve our business. &nbsp;
        Please read on for details.
    </p><ul class="bulleted_list tiny_text phl"><li>
            Cookies are pieces of text that
            may be provided to your computer through your web browser or application when
            you access a website or service. Your browser stores cookies in a manner
            associated with each website or service you visit. We use cookies to enable our
            servers to recognize your web browser or Sulia application and tell us how and
            when you visit and use Sulia through the web or through an application.
        </li><li>
            While Sulia uses cookies to
            recognize you, it is our policy to never provide any Personally Identifiable
            Information obtained from these cookies to Third Party Services.
        </li><li>
            Most browsers have an option for
            turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting
            new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser
            software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety
            of ways. If you disable cookies you may not be able to take advantage of the
            most attractive features of Sulia.
        </li></ul><p><strong>Information Related to Advertising:</strong></p><p>
        We may serve advertisements, and also allow third party advertisements,
        through Sulia. Advertisements served through Sulia may be targeted to users
        who fit a certain generic profile. Some of these advertisements may come
        from third party companies called “ad networks.”&nbsp; Ad networks include
        third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research
        firms. We do not provide Personally Identifiable Information to any ad
        networks for use outside of Sulia.
    </p><p><strong>Aggregate Information:</strong></p><p>
        We collect statistical information about how people use Sulia
        (“Aggregate Information”). This statistical information is not Personally
        Identifiable Information and cannot be tied back to you, your Account, your
        web browser or your Sulia application.
    </p><p>
        We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and
        other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of
        statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often
        people use Sulia and their services or websites, which facilitates
        improving both their services and how we interface with them. In addition,
        these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise
        non Personally Identifiable Information about you that they have
        independently developed or acquired.
    </p><h2>How and To Whom Is My Information Shared?</h2><p>
        Sulia is designed to help you share information that you or people you
        choose to follow elect to post to Sulia or Third Party Services.
    </p><p><strong>Public Sulia Activity Information:</strong></p><p>
        Much of your activity on and through Sulia is public by default. This
        includes, but is not limited to:
    </p><ul class="bulleted_list tiny_text phl"><li>Channels and members that you follow, your profile information, including selected avatar/image, user name, bio, etc.</li><li>
            Content that you create and curate on your Account, and metrics and
            analytics information for your curated content, as described above.
        </li></ul><p>
        Some of this information may be associated with your Account and some of
        this information is publicly accessible to other Sulia users who choose to
        follow your curated content. Therefore, we urge you to think
        carefully about including any specific information you may deem private
        in content that you create or submit through Sulia.
    </p><p>
        Any information that you elect to make public through Sulia will be
        instantly distributed and may then become accessible to users of Sulia,
        Third Party Services to which we distribute content, and Third Party
        Services that you link to Sulia. Sulia respects the privacy
        settings/policies that you have selected with Third Party Services, and
        only shares information consistent with those privacy settings and policies.
    </p><p><strong>Information Shared with Our Agents:</strong></p><p>
        We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain
        tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “Agents”). We may
        need to share Personally Identifiable Information with our Agents in order
        to provide products or services to you. Our Agents do not have any right
        to use Personally Identifiable Information or other information we share
        with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
    </p><p><strong>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:</strong></p><p>
        In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of
        transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business
        assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets associated with
        Sulia, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business
        or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that may
        be transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
        transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us may continue to use your
        Personally Identifiable Information as set forth in this policy.
    </p><p><strong>Information Disclosed for the Protection of Us and Others:</strong></p><p>
        We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any
        information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any
        applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii)
        enforce these Terms of Service, including investigation of potential
        violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud,
        security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or
        (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This
        includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for
        fraud protection and spam prevention.
    </p><p><strong>Information We Share With Your Consent:</strong></p><p>
        Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personally
        Identifiable Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able
        to prevent the sharing of this information.
    </p><h2>How Can I Delete My Account?</h2><p>
        Should you ever decide to delete your Account, you may do so by emailing
        <a href="mailto:support@sulia.com">support@sulia.com</a>. If you terminate
        and delete your Account, any association between your Account and
        information stored in connection with Sulia will no longer be accessible.
        However, you understand that (i) certain User Content will remain
        available, (ii) any of your User Content that has been re-posted will not
        be removed and will continue to be used in accordance with the
        <a href="/terms_of_use">Terms of Use</a>, and (iii) any removed
        User Content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time.
    </p><h2>What Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?</h2><p>
        We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we
        collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such
        information is used. If we make changes in the way we collect or use
        information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on or within
        Sulia or sending you an email. A user is bound by any changes to the
        Privacy Policy when he or she uses Sulia after such changes have been
        first posted.
    </p><h2>What If I Have Questions or Concerns?</h2><p>
        If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using Sulia, please
        send us a detailed message to
        <a href="mailto:privacy@sulia.com">privacy@sulia.com</a>.
        We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.
