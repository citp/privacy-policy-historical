**Cookies and Other Tracking Devices**

We use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Sites and Services.

**_Cookies:_** Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally improving your experience on our Sites. Cookies make the interaction between you and the Sites faster and easier.

We use cookies to improve your user experience by enabling our Sites to 'remember' you, either for the duration of your visit (using a "session cookie") or for repeat visits (using a "persistent cookie"). SugarCRM uses both session cookies and persistent cookies when you access our Sites. Session cookies expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your browser until you erase them or they expire.

You may encounter cookies or pixel tags on websites that we do not control. For example, if you view a web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie or pixel tag placed by the web page or application. Likewise, these third parties may place cookies or pixel tags that are not subject to our control and this Policy does not cover their use.

How Do I Disable Cookies? Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.


**_Web Beacons:_** We may use "web beacons" (electronic images also known as pixel tags or clear gifs) to recognize a cookie on your computer when you view or act upon a web page, an advertisement that we've placed on a third-party web page, or an email or other electronic communication that we've sent.

**_Local Storage Objects ("LSOs"):_** We also use Local Shared Objects (LSO), sometimes referred to as "Flash" cookies. Use of Local Shared Objects can help prevent fraud and can support our Sites. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose "Global Storage Settings Panel" and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose "Website Storage Settings Panel" and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.

**_Other Tracking Technologies:_** We may also collect usage and performance data through our Apps using various platform specific- tracking technologies applicable to the Apps.

**_Do Not Track:_** Our Sites do not respond to web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms. If, in the future, we create a program or protocol to respond to such web browser signals, we will inform you and share details of how it works.

**Third Parties**

SugarCRM may allow certain companies, such as analytics partners, advertisers, application developers and ad networks, to use cookies, web beacons, LSOs and other tracking technologies on the Sites and Services as described below.

**_Analytics:_** SugarCRM uses a variety of third-party services to help us understand the use of our Sites and Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, such as cookies or your IP address.

For example, the information generated by the cookie and other platform-specific technology about your use of our Services (including your Internet protocol ("IP") address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Sites, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.

**_Advertising:_** We use third parties such as network advertisers and analytics providers to assist us in displaying advertisements on our Sites and on third party websites. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Sites as well as other websites. In cases of re-targeting technology, third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may put cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies on your computer to collect information about your interests. This provides our website visitors with advertising displays or text ads, that most likely match their product and information interests and enables us and the network advertisers to measure the effectiveness of the ads.

You may opt-out of many third party ad networks. To learn more about this, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) at [www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance at [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) (DAA). Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites.

**User Generated Content**

We may collect personal information about you when you voluntarily post in blogs, chat rooms, forums or message boards available from the Sites. All of the information that you post will be available to all visitors to our Sites. SugarCRM is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums. We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law or your personal privacy.

**Notice to Non-U.S. Persons**

If you choose to provide us with information, including personal information, you understand that we are transferring it to SugarCRM's locations and systems in the United States or to the locations and systems of SugarCRM's service providers around the world.

**Links to Third Party Site(s) and Applications**

The Sites provide links to third party websites or resources (e.g. applications) over which SugarCRM does not have control. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by SugarCRM and SugarCRM does not control the content or privacy policies or practices of such sites. Any access to and use of such linked websites or any resources available on our Sites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties' websites.

**Security**

Transmissions over the Internet are never 100% secure or error-free. SugarCRM employs procedural and technological measures that are reasonably designed to help protect personal information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

**Children's Privacy**

SugarCRM recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13. SugarCRM does not target this Site to children under 13. SugarCRM does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

**Changes to Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of this statement from time to time and in our sole discretion, but will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the statement the date it was last updated. Your continued access to the Sites and Services will indicate your acceptance of our updated Policy. We recommend that users revisit this statement on occasion to learn of any changes.
