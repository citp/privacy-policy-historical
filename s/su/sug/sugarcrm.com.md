You may choose whether or not to provide personal information to SugarCRM. You have the choice to opt-out of receiving information from SugarCRM. If you choose not to provide the personal information we request, you can still visit most of SugarCRM's web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers and services that involve our interaction with you. 

If you chose to have a relationship with SugarCRM, such as a contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.
