Hachette websites use cookies (not the edible kind). A 'cookie' is a piece of information that our websites send to your browser, which then stores this information on your system.

The Hachette website also makes use of ad-serving cookies. These assure that when you visit a website, you do not see the same ad over and over again. They are also used to sequence ads in a series, and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a particular ad or visited a particular Web page.
