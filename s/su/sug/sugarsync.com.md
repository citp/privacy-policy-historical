## INFORMATION WE COLLECT

In order to provide our services, we collect the following types of information:

### Registration Information

When you register with SugarSync or for our Community Forum in order to create an account, we ask you to provide us with personal information including your name, email address, recipients email address, photo of yourself or a friend (optional), account password, account pin, mailing address and phone number; and depending upon the type of account you create, we may also ask you for billing information (such as credit card number) and the operating system of your computer or device used by you to use and access the services. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). When you register, we also subscribe you to our mailing list to receive marketing emails such as promotions or special deals and newsletters. You may opt-out/unsubscribe at any time by logging into your account and updating your notifications settings, by following the instructions included in each communication, or by sending us an email at support@sugarsync.com.

In order to use the SugarSync services you must be at least thirteen (13) years of age. As children under the age of 13 are not allowed to use the SugarSync services, this Privacy Policy makes no provision for their use. In the event that a user identifies himself or herself as a child under the age of 13 within the SugarSync website at www.sugarsync.com (the "website"), SugarSync will not collect, store or use any personal information of such user. Further, in the event that SugarSync receives personal information that SugarSync discovers was provided by a child under the age of 13, SugarSync will promptly delete such personal information in a secure manner.

### User Communication

We will send you a welcoming email to verify your e-mail address. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to inform you about our services, and to manage your account, and for service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications. If you send us email or other communications, we may retain the content of your communications together with your email address and our responses.

You have the opportunity to receive an email notification when a recipient accesses a file you sent to them as well as the option to receive a daily summary email for shared folder activities. You may unsubscribe from receiving these types of notifications by logging into your account and making the selections under notifications.

You may ask that we send you emails when there are new forum posts added as well as new comments within a forum that you have already commented on. You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by logging into your forum account.

### Files/Photos

If you choose to use our services, we may store your electronic files or photos on our servers. Files and photos are encrypted on the SugarSync servers and are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption during transmission. If you utilize Web-based or mobile access to your files or photos, you must be sure to properly log off your Internet session to prevent access to your files or photos by someone using the same computer. Your files and photos may be stored for up to 90 days after you have deleted them from your account or after your account has been terminated. If you use the mobile app to upload photos to SugarSync you must be logged into the SugarSync app. The photos you choose to upload from your mobile phone are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption.

You are in control of who is able to view your photos. You have the ability to set your albums to private, public or share them with other users. You may change the visibility of your albums at any time by logging into your account.

We provide you the option to share photos on Facebook. If you elect to use that option you are providing us with your permission for access to your basic information, posting to your wall and your Facebook photos and videos. You may at any time revoke your permissions by logging into your Facebook account and removing the SugarSync Facebook app.

You have the option to share links to SugarSync on Facebook and Twitter. If you are already signed into either one of those services you will be prompted to post a link on your wall. If you are not signed in to either service you will be redirected to either site and prompted to login. SugarSync has no access to your Facebook or Twitter account nor do we store your login information.

### Information that You Provide to Others

If you want to share files or photos that are stored on your account with others, you will need to provide email addresses or other contact information for such persons. We will use the information you provide only to enable such persons to view the shared files or photos and to use our services. We will not use this information for any other purpose. Please note that SugarSync may prevent the sharing of certain types of files or photos, depending upon what services you are using.

If you wish to add contacts to your account we will collect their name, phone number, email address and a photo (if you wish to upload one for them). You may at any time remove this information from your account. If your contacts wish to be removed from our system for any reason they may send us a request to support@sugarsync.com.

You may utilize an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts. When using the import contacts feature, we'll prompt you for your login information which we do not store or use for any other purpose. You can then access your contacts to share files, folders and public links and to invite people from your email address books to join SugarSync. Emails sent through SugarSync will identify you as the sender.

### Website Use Information

Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" and web server logs to collect information about how our website is used. A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. When you log onto and browse our website, our website server automatically receives and records information on our website server logs from your browser, which may include your IP address, cookie, page(s) viewed, the date and time of visits, time spent at our website, and websites visited just before and just after our website. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

Our website uses cookies to differentiate you from other users and to improve your user experience (for example, by enabling you to log in fewer times than would otherwise be required). In addition, cookies, in conjunction with our server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our website and which parts of the site are more popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve our website and better serve our customers.

We use analytics within our mobile application for visibility purposes, to track how many times the application was opened and the pages viewed within the application. However, we do not use your personal information for analytics and we do not ask you for, access, or track any location based information from your mobile device.

The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Some third parties use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.

Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

We use information which we collect for purposes of providing the services, auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services, ensuring the functioning of our servers, providing customer service, contacting you as described in this Privacy Policy, and to enable features of the services, such as to allow you to share photos and files with friends, and developing new products and services for our customers and prospective customers. We may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our services, respond to your support requests, and send you newsletters and special offers which we think you may find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by sending an email to support@sugarsync.com, by logging into your account and updating your notifications settings, or by following the instructions included in each communication. Please keep in mind that by using our services, we may need to send you information regarding your account, such as service announcements, so by your use of our services, you authorize us to send you such information and you may not opt out of receiving those messages.

### Public Forums

Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs, private messages or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at support@sugarsync.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

The SugarSync Community forum is hosted on our third party service provider's platform. All information collected within this area of the site is governed by our Privacy Policy. Our third party service provider is not allowed to use your personal information for any other purpose other than to provide this platform for the use of our clients.

You are in control of who is able to see your profile within the community forum.

### Sharing Information with Third Parties

We do not share your files stored on our servers with any third parties unless instructed by you and allowed by SugarSync. We will not disclose your files to anyone unless you instruct us to do so or a court orders us to do so. Your files are not considered "personal information."

SugarSync does not sell or rent your personal information to third parties except that your personal information may be disclosed to third parties in the following circumstances:

  * When you have signed up for our services, we may disclose your personal information to our affiliates and subsidiaries to provide the services to you.
  * We may use third parties to perform services related to our operations such as a payment processor, chat personnel, community platform hosting provider, and an email service provider. In connection with these business operations, third parties may have access to your personal information. These third parties will be subject to an agreement to treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  * If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, we will provide notice by email before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
  * We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the law or comply with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights and property, our services and/or users of our services; (c) enforce the terms of use with respect to our services (including investigation of potential violations thereof); (d) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (e) protect the safety of users of the services, us or third parties.
  * We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the average number of photographs being stored by users. Such information does not identify you individually.



We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. Within SugarSync, we restrict access to personal information to SugarSync employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These persons are bound by confidentiality obligations.

### Email Transmissions

Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this reason, we request that you do not send private or sensitive information to us by email. Some of the personal information you may enter on our website (e.g., login, reset password, credit card number etc.) will be transmitted securely via Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) server, which encrypts such information.

### Links to External Sites

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our website nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other websites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our website.

Please remember that when you use a link to go from our website to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.

### How to Access and Correct Your Information

You may access, delete inaccuracies, and correct your information at any time by logging into your account and changing the necessary information. If you need assistance in doing so, you may email us at support@sugarsync.com. If you cancel your SugarSync account, your identification, billing and contact information may remain in our records for some period of time.
