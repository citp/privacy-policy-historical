                            <p>SugarSync complies with the U.S. - E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

                            <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
                            <p>In order to provide the services, we collect the following types of information:</p>

                            <h3>Registration Information</h3>
                            <p>When you register with SugarSync or for our community forum in order to create an account, we ask you to provide us with personal information including your name, email address, recipients email address, photo of yourself or a friend (optional), account password, account pin, mailing address and phone number, and depending upon the type of account you create, we may also ask you for billing information (such as credit card number) and the operating system of your computer or device used by you to use and access the services. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
                            <p>In order to use the services you must be at least thirteen (13) years of age. As children under the age of 13 are not allowed to use the services, this Privacy Policy makes no provision for their use. In the event that a user identifies himself or herself as a child under the age of 13 within the SugarSync website at www.sugarsync.com (our "website"), SugarSync will not collect, store or use any personal information of such user. Further, in the event that SugarSync receives personal information that SugarSync discovers was provided by a child under the age of 13, SugarSync will promptly delete such personal information in a secure manner.</p>

                            <h3>User Communication</h3>
                            <p>We will send you a welcoming email to verify your e-mail address. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to inform you about the services, to manage your account, and for service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if the service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications. If you send us email or other communications, we may retain the content of your communications together with your email address and our responses.</p>
                            <p>You have the opportunity to receive an email notification when a recipient accesses a file you sent to them as well as the option to receive a daily summary email for shared folder activities. You may unsubscribe from receiving these types of notifications by logging into your account and making the selections under notifications.</p>
                            <p>You may ask that we send you emails when there are new forum posts added as well as new comments within a forum that you have already commented on. You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by logging into your forum account.</p>

                            <h3>Files/Photos</h3>
                            <p>If you choose to use the services, we may store your electronic files or photos on our servers. Files and photos are encrypted on the SugarSync servers and are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption during transmission. If you utilize Web-based or mobile access to your files or photos, you must be sure to properly log off your Internet session to prevent access to your files or photos by someone using the same computer. Your files and photos may be stored for up to 90 days after you have deleted them from your account or after your account has been terminated. If you use the mobile app to upload photos to SugarSync you must be logged into the SugarSync app. The photos you choose to upload from your mobile phone are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption.</p>
                            <p>You are in control of who is able to view your photos. You have the ability to set your albums to private, public or share them with other users. You may change the visibility of your albums at any time by logging into your account.</p>
                            <p>We provide you the option to share photos on Facebook. If you elect to use that option you are providing us with your permission for access to your basic information, posting to your wall and your Facebook photos and videos. You may at any time revoke your permissions by logging into your Facebook account and removing the SugarSync Facebook app.</p>
                            <p>You have the option to share links to SugarSync on Facebook and Twitter. If you are already signed into either one of those services you will be prompted to post a link on your wall. If you are not signed in to either service you will be redirected to the applicable site and prompted to login. SugarSync has no access to your Facebook or Twitter account nor do we store your login information.</p>
                            <p>Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook "like" button and widgets, the "share this" button, and interactive mini-programs that run on our website. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>

                            <h3>Information That You Provide to Others</h3>
                            <p>If you want to share files or photos that are stored on your account with others, you will need to provide email addresses or other contact information for such persons. We will use the information you provide only to enable such persons to view the shared files or photos and to use the services. We will not use this information for any other purpose. Please note that SugarSync may prevent the sharing of certain types of files or photos, depending upon what services you are using.</p>
                            <p>If you wish to add contacts to your account we will collect their name, phone number, email address and a photo (if you wish to upload one for them). You may at any time remove this information from your account. If your contacts wish to be removed from our system for any reason they may contact us at <a href="http://support.sugarsync.com">support.sugarsync.com</a>.</p>
                            <p>You may utilize an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts. When using the import contacts feature, we will prompt you for your login information which we do not store or use for any other purpose. You can then access your contacts to share files, folders and public links and to invite people from your email address books to join SugarSync. Emails sent through SugarSync will identify you as the sender.</p>

                            <h3>Website Use Information</h3>
                            <p>When you log onto and browse our website, our website server automatically receives and records information on our website server logs from your browser, which may include your IP address, cookie, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), operating system, clickstream data, page(s) viewed, the date and time of visits, time spent at our website, and websites visited just before and just after our website. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personal information you submit while on our website.</p>
                            <p>Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by SugarSync and our marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the website, tracking users movements around the website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.</p>
                            <p>We use cookies to remember your settings and for authentication purposes. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our website, but your ability to use some features or areas of our website may be limited.</p>
                            <p>We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.</p>
                            <p>Certain web browsers may allow you to enable a "do not track" option that sends signals to the websites you visit indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different than blocking "cookies" as browsers with the "do not track" option selected may still accept "cookies." Right now, there is no industry standard for how companies should respond to "do not track" signals, although one may be adopted in the future. We do not respond to "do not track" signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will modify this Privacy Policy accordingly. More information about "do not track" is available at <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.org">www.allaboutdnt.org</a>.</p>
                            <p>We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on our website and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">here</a> (or if located in the European Union click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">here</a>) Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
                            <p>We use analytics within our mobile application for visibility purposes, to track how many times the application was opened and the pages viewed within the application. However, we do not use your personal information for analytics. We collect your location based information for the purpose of enabling uploads of mobile photos and videos from mobile.  We will only share this information with our mapping provider for the sole purpose of providing you the service. When you download and use the services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use and the operating system version.  We may occasionally send you push notifications through our mobile applications to send you services related notifications that may be of importance to you. You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by turning them off at the device level through your settings.</p>

                            <h2>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION</h2>
                            <p>We use information which we collect for purposes of: providing the services, auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve the services, ensuring the functioning of our servers, providing customer service, contacting you as described in this Privacy Policy, enabling features of the services, such as to allow you to share photos and files with friends, and developing new products and services for our customers and prospective customers. We may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to the services, respond to your support requests, and send you newsletters and special offers which we think you may find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by contacting us at <a href="http://support.sugarsync.com">support.sugarsync.com</a>, by logging into your account and updating your notifications settings, or by following the instructions included in each communication. Please keep in mind that by using the services, we may need to send you information regarding your account, such as service announcements, so by your use of the services, you authorize us to send you such information and you may not opt out of receiving those messages.</p>

                            <h3>Referrals</h3>
                            <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our website, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website. SugarSync stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>
                            <p>Your friend may contact us at <a href="http://support.sugarsync.com">support.sugarsync.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

                            <h3>Public Forums</h3>

                            <p>The SugarSync community forum is hosted on our third party service provider's platform. All information collected within this area of the website is governed by our Privacy Policy. Our third party service provider is not allowed to use your personal information for any other purpose other than to provide the platform for the use of our clients.</p>
                            <p>You are in control of who is able to see your profile within the community forum.</p>

                            <h3>Sharing Information With Third Parties</h3>
                            <p>We do not share your files stored on our servers with any third parties unless instructed by you, a court orders us to do so, or as described herein. Your files are not considered "personal information."</p>

In the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, your personal information and Files may be transferred as a business asset.</li>
                                <li>We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the law or comply with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights and property, the services and/or users of the services; (c) enforce the Terms of Service with respect to the services (including investigation of potential violations thereof); (d) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (e) protect the safety of users of the services, us or third parties.</li>
