Our Web advertising partners may set cookies.  These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement.  In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on.  This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by SSN and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

**Security**

SSN visitor accounts are secured by member-created passwords. SunshineStateNews.com takes precautions to ensure that visitor account information is kept private.  We use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to visitor information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff.  While the site does use very secure protection measures, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of visitor account information.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time.  For any additional information about the security measures we use on SunshineStateNews.com, please contact us at [info@SunshineStateNews.com](mailto:info@SunshineStateNews.com).

**Sharing and Disclosure of Information SSN Collects**

Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Sunshine State News will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by SSN, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the SSN Terms of Use Agreement or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service. SSN reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of SSN or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest.  For more information see the "Changes in Our Privacy Policy" section below.

**Changes in Our Privacy Policy**

From time to time we may make changes to our privacy policy.  If we make changes, we will post them on our site to make users aware of what the changes are so users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose it.  A User is bound by any minor changes to the policy when she or he uses the site after those changes have been posted.  If, however, we are going to use visitors' personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days.
