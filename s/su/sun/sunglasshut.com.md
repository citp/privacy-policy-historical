### Security and Privacy Notice

### Our Commitment

Sunglass Hut is committed to using our best efforts to ensure the security of your transactions on www.SunglassHut.com (the "Site") and protecting the privacy of the information you chose to share with us. By choosing to visit our Site, you are accepting the practices, terms and conditions described in this Security and Privacy Notice. Please feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns you may have regarding these policies.

### Secure Ordering

We make every effort to protect your online order information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than Sunglasshut.com. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser) then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https". It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your credit card information, to your password and to your computer.

Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you'll be unable to connect to the server so you won't have to worry about mistakenly placing an order through an unsecured connection.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
