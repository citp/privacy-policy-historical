**Privacy**  
For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name (where possible), but not the email address. We collect the domain name and email address (where possible) of visitors to our Web page, the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, user-specific information on what pages consumers access or visit, information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations, name and address, telephone number, fax number and payment information (e.g., credit card number and billing address).

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our pages, used to notify consumers about updates to our website, shared with other reputable organizations to help them contact consumers for marketing purposes or used by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes. We do not make email addresses available to other organizations for commercial purposes. Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers online will only receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed online.

We use cookies to store visitors preferences, record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart and record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site. In some cases, our authorized third party partners may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies on our site to deliver more relevant advertising to consumers. You may opt-out of receiving Sundance banner ads on third party sites by clicking the "X" in the upper right hand corner of the ad.

As a result of completing a transaction on our site, you will be subscribed to marketing emails, unless you have previously opted out of marketing emails.

If you do not want to receive email from us in the future, or to modify or change your personal information, click on the "My Account" link located on the top right of each page. All changes to your account can be made there.

If you supply us with your postal address online you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. We sometimes make your name and postal address available to other select direct marketing companies who may have offers of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by calling us at the number provided above, emailing us at the above address or writing to us at the above address. Please provide us with your exact name and address. We will be sure your name is removed from the list we share with other organizations.

Upon request we provide site visitors with access to unique identifier information (e.g., customer number or password) that we maintain about them, transaction information (e.g., dates on which customers made purchases, amounts and types of purchases) that we maintain about them, contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number) that we maintain about them and a description of information that we maintain about them. Consumers can access this information by [Email](mailto:service@sundance.net), calling us at 1-800-422-2770, Live Chat or writing to us at the above address.

Upon request we offer visitors the ability to have inaccuracies corrected in contact information, financial information or transaction information.

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically. Customers may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by [Email](mailto:service@sundance.net), calling us at 1-800-422-2770, Live Chat or writing to us at the above address.  
  
**Security**  
Ordering from our site is as secure as ordering via a catalog or using your credit card at your favorite restaurant. The media has played a large role in accelerating the myth that online shopping subverts your personal information any more than shopping anywhere else. If you shop from trusted merchants with an established brand, your online experience should be worry free.

At Sundance we use SSL (Secure Socket Layering) 128 bit encryption to protect your information as it travels over the internet. We also hold a secure key, or digital certificate, through Digital Signature Trust. This key ensures that we are who we say we are and that any data exchanged online is protected from theft and tampering. Consumer protection laws protect you against any unauthorized use of your credit card. Federal law dictates that your legal liability is limited to $50 if your credit card number is used without your permission. If you suspect any illegal use of your card, call your issuing bank immediately to make sure your rights are protected.

We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site.

If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, you may contact us by [Email](mailto:service@sundance.net), calling us at 1-800-422-2770, Live Chat or writing to us at the above address.
