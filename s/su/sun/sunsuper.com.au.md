# Sunsuper - Privacy policy

At Sunsuper we aim to provide you with the best possible service and in doing so we are committed to protecting your privacy and security of personal information. Please read on for more details about our privacy & security policies. You can contact us in writing at GPO Box 2924, Brisbane, QLD 4001 or by phoning our Customer Service Team on 13 11 84.

## What does "personal information" mean?

Personal information is any information about you that identifies you or by which your identity can be reasonably determined.

## What information do we collect and why do we collect it?

When you join Sunsuper, you will need to provide us with your personal details, including:

  * Identification details such as your name, date of birth, gender, address (email, mailing address), contact numbers and your tax file number
  * Insurance related information such as your medical history, occupation details, salary information (for income protection purposes) and other health information



We need your identification details to process your application, manage your participation in the Fund, ensure you receive your entitlements from the Fund and provide you with information about your superannuation benefits from time to time.

We need the insurance related information so that your eligibility for death and disability insurance can be assessed. If you make a claim for a disability benefit, more information is collected about your disability in order to assess your eligibility for the benefit. During the course of your membership we will hold investment related information about you such as the amount of your superannuation contributions (including rollovers, employer contributions, salary sacrifice contributions and spouse contributions) and your investment preferences.

When a benefit is due to be paid, we will ask for details about the bank account or other institution, where you would like the benefit paid. If you die, we will need information about persons who are entitled to be considered for distribution of the death benefit. This includes your spouse, children, any other dependant, and any person who might be a beneficiary of your estate. The information we will ask for about those persons will be their name and address, gender, date of birth, details of their financial position and financial needs, and any other information that will assist us in deciding to whom the death benefit should be distributed.

## How do we collect personal information?

We collect information about you through your Membership Application form and through various other forms. Some information (for example, a change of address) can be provided by you over the telephone. Some information about you is collected from employers. When a member joins Sunsuper, the employer may provide the member's name, address and tax file number. When a benefit is payable, the employer provides details of the date of termination of employment. Employers may also notify us of updated address details from time to time.

On a member's death, we normally collect information about potential beneficiaries from the beneficiaries themselves. However, we will also collect some information about the identity of potential beneficiaries from the member's executor or administrator or whoever notifies us of the member's death.

If you make a claim for a disability benefit, most of the information about the disability is collected from you directly, but information may also be collected from doctors and other experts and sometimes from your employer. New members are asked to give their consent to information being collected from these other sources if they make a claim for a disability benefit.

## How do we use information we collect?

Generally, we only use personal information that we collect from you for the purpose of managing your participation in Sunsuper. We may also use the personal information we collect to occasionally notify you about:

  * important changes to Sunsuper and its products
  * other new products which you might find valuable
  * products offered by other parties we believe you may be interested in.



We give new members the opportunity to nominate not to receive information about products offered by other parties. You also have this opportunity each time information of this type is sent.

## Do we disclose your personal information to anyone?

Sunsuper may disclose your personal information in certain circumstances. Generally, we do not disclose your personal information to a party outside the Sunsuper group, unless that party is contracted to Sunsuper to provide administrative services or activities on our behalf and that party is bound by the same privacy rules we follow.

Some examples of parties outside Sunsuper, to whom we may disclose your personal information and the reason for disclosure, are:

  * Sunsuper's administration service provider, for the purposes of administering the superannuation fund
  * Mail service providers for the mailing of member statements and other information
  * Insurers, insurance assessors or medical practitioners for the purpose of the assessment of claims for insurance benefits or request for insurance cover
  * Sometimes, if there is a dispute about a benefit we may disclose personal information about you to other experts such as legal advisers.
  * Occasionally, we are required or authorised by law to disclose your personal information. For example, we may disclose your personal information to the Australian Taxation Office following a direction issued under taxation laws or to a Court in response to a subpoena.
  * We may disclose your personal information to third parties where you give us written permission to do so (for example, to a financial planner with whom you are dealing).



## Can you access the personal information we hold about you?

You can request access to any of the personal information we hold about you. A summary of personal information such as your name and address details, contact telephone numbers, insurance cover and superannuation accounts you have with us, is available to you by calling us on 13 11 84. For security reasons however, we will not give information over the telephone unless the person making the enquiry is able to answer a list of questions to confirm their identity. You cannot access information about any other member.

Sunsuper may retain your personal information for a period of time after you have ceased your relationship with us. When we believe it is no longer necessary to hold your personal information in our archiving system we attend to the secure destruction or deletion of your personal information.

## How do we protect your information and ensure it is accurate?

Only authorised staff who are employed under strict confidentiality agreements have access to your personal details. The administration systems used to manage your superannuation incorporate the use of secure hardware and software products which protect against unauthorised access. All hard copies with your personal details are also protected in our secure archiving system.

We also try to ensure that the information we hold about members remains accurate, complete and up-to-date. At the time of joining, you will be sent a "welcome letter" which will ask you to check and correct your personal details. When your annual member statement is sent out, you will be asked to notify any changes in your personal information. Sometimes when you make a telephone enquiry we will ask you if our records of your details are up-to-date (for example, we may ask you to tell us whether your address on our records is current).
