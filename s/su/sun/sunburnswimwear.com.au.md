If you purchase any of your products online, we will also use the information you provide us to process your order and its delivery to you.

**Accessing your information  
**

We like to know that the personal information you provide us is accurate, complete and up to date. If you notice that your personal information is missing or incorrect, you can update your details online on our website.
