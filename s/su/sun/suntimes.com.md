**You can control cookies and tracking tools.** We may use cookies and other technologies to store information on your computer or mobile device. Advertising service vendors that serve ads on the Services may also use their own cookies or identifiers.

Opting out of browser cookies will not disable other technologies that we may use to collect information from you, including “flash cookies,” which cannot be controlled through your browser settings.

If you block cookies on your browser, certain features of the Services may not work. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking activities we have described in this Policy will stop. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific.

**You can control tools on your mobile devices.** For example, you can turn off the GPS locator or push notifications on your mobile device. Each push notification has an “unsubscribe” link.

**You can opt-out of targeted advertising.**

The advertisements on the Services may be provided by us, or they may be provided by a third-party vendor. These advertisements may be targeted, which means that advertisers want to reach a certain type of audience, and your information may be used in order to serve advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you. One of our advertising vendors, Google Inc. displays ads on our Services. If you would like more information about its practices, including information on how to opt-out, please click here: <http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/> or if you would like to manage your advertising preferences, please click here: <http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/>.

In some instances, we and advertisers on the Services work with ad networks and analytics providers which use cookies or other online technologies to collect information about your online activity such as type of pages viewed and categories of interests. Many third party vendors that that perform these functions are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance, and you can opt out of those vendors’ delivery of targeted advertising to you by visiting <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> and <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>.

We do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

Choices you make are both browser and device-specific. Some web browsers, mobile devices, and plug-ins have a “Do Not Track” feature. This feature lets you tell websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. These features are not yet uniform across browsers. Our sites are not currently set up to respond to those signals.

**The Services and children**.

Our Services are meant for adults. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 without permission from a parent or guardian. If you are a parent or legal guardian and think your child under 13 has given us information, you can email us at privacy@suntimes.com.

This includes not sharing your passwords. We keep personal information as long as it is necessary or relevant for the practices described in this Policy. We also keep information as otherwise required by law.

If you live outside of the United States, you understand and agree that we may transfer your information to the United States. This site is subject to U.S. laws, which may not afford the same level of protection as those in your country.
