# Privacy & Confidentiality - Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre

Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre is responsible for personal health information under its control and is committed to a high standard of privacy for their information practices. We are committed to ensuring that staff and patients understand the importance of privacy rights and obligations. The Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) balances an individual's right to privacy with the need of health care providers to access and share this information. PHIPA gives an individual the ability to control how his/her own personal health information is collected, used and disclosed. 

At Sunnybrook we collect personal health information about you directly from you or from the person acting on your behalf. The personal health information we collect may include, for example, your name, date of birth, address, health card number and extended health insurance numbers, health history, records of your visits to Sunnybrook and the care that you received during those visits. Occasionally, we collect personal health information about you from other sources, if we have obtained your consent to do so or if the law permits.
