		<p><strong><span>Protecting the privacy and safeguarding the personal and financial information of our clients and Web site visitors is one of our highest priorities. The following Privacy Statement explains how we collect and protect your information. By opening an account or by using our Web site, you give your consent to the collection and use of personal information by us as explained in this privacy statement.</span></strong></p><p><strong><span><br></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Collection of personal information</span></strong></p><p><span>We collect information required to open an account, to transact business effectively and to safeguard your assets&nbsp;and your privacy. To do this, we gather information to help us assess your needs and preferences.</span></p><p><span>The information we collect directly from you includes information required to communicate with you, including your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address and to identify who you are. We also collect demographic information when you open an account, including, birth date, education, occupation, etc. We also assess your trading experience, your approximate annual income and approximate net worth to assess your financial position.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><strong><span>Usage of personal information</span></strong></p><p><span>We use personal information only as appropriate to provide you quality service and security. For example, we may use the information collected from you to verify your identity and contact information. We may also use this information to establish and set up your trading account, issue an account number and a secure password, maintain your account activity, and contact you with account information. This information helps us improve our services to you, customize your browsing experience and inform you about additional products, services or promotions that may be of interest to you.</span></p><p><strong><span><br></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Our affiliates and partners</span></strong></p><p><span>We may share information with affiliates if the information is required to provide the product or service you have requested or to provide you the opportunity to participate in the products or services our affiliates offer. We may also forge partnerships and alliances, which may include joint marketing agreements, with other companies who offer high-quality products and services that might be of value to our clients. In order to ensure that these products and services meet your needs and are delivered in a manner that is useful and relevant, we may share some information with partners, affiliates and alliances. This allows them to better understand the offers that are most relevant and useful. The use of your personal information is limited to the purposes identified in our relationship with the partner or affiliate.</span></p><p><strong><span><br></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Non-affiliated third parties</span></strong></p><p><span>We do not sell, license, lease or otherwise disclose your personal information to any third party for any reason, except as described below.</span></p><p><span>We reserve the right to disclose your personal information to third parties where required by law to regulatory, law enforcement or other government authorities. We may also disclose your information as necessary to credit reporting or collection agencies, or when necessary to protect our rights or property.</span></p><p><span>To help us improve our services to you, we may engage another business to help us to carry out certain internal functions such as account processing, fulfillment, client service, client satisfaction surveys or other data collection activities relevant to our business. We may also provide a party with client information from our database to help us to analyze and identify client needs and notify clients of product and service offerings. Use of the information shared is strictly limited to the performance of the task we request and for no other purpose. All third parties with which we share personal information are required to protect personal information in a manner similar to the way we protect personal information.</span></p><p><strong><span><br></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Restriction of responsibility</span></strong></p><p><span>If at any time you choose to purchase a product or service offered by another company, any personal information you share with that company will no longer be controlled under our Privacy Statement.

                    <p>Risk Warning:<br><br>
                        Forex and CFDs are leveraged products, incur a high level of risk and may not be suitable for
                        all investors. Due to its speculative nature, forex trading may not be suitable for all
                        investors. Only investors, who understand the economic and leg
                        al risks associated with trading, are willing to assume such risks, and who have sufficient
                        funds to bear losses which may exceed margin or deposits, should proceed to open an account with
                        SunbirdFX. Before deciding to trade, please ensure you understand the risks involved and take
                        into account your level of experience. Seek independent advice if necessary.</p>
                    <br><p>*Forex/CFD trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors.</p>

                    <p>Risk Disclaimer:<br><br>
                        Disclosure of Risk - Trading and the execution of financial transactions similar to those
                        described and/or resulting from this agreement, with or without the use of high financial
                        leverage, is speculative trading of high risk. You must carefully and seriously consider if this
                        type of financial activity suits your needs, your financial resources and personal
                        circumstances. As the risk of losing some, or all, of the invested funds in a relatively short
                        period of time is high, it is recommended that you use only funds which you have earmarked for
                        speculative, high risk financial transactions. In particular, be aware of the following points:
                        High financial leverage in the trading of currency, commodities and other financial assets, is
                        created based on collateral of a low sum relative to the total transaction. The results of
                        trading with high financial leverage are that a small change in market prices, within a short
                        period of time, may cause substantial gain or loss, proportional to the size of the collateral,
                        up to the total loss of the collateral sum in a very short period of time. The fluctuation of
                        the rates in the currency markets, commodities and financial derivatives are often sharp without
                        the ability to forecast the size or direction of the change or the time frame in which it
                        occurs.This warning does not cover all the possible risks connected with this type of
                        transactions described and/or result from this agreement.</p>
