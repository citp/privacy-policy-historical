<p><strong>We may share information with third parties.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We will share information with our corporate affiliates. </strong>Our corporate affiliates include the Wrapports, LLC family of companies.</p>

<p><strong>We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business. </strong>For example, if part of our business was sold we may provide our customer list as part of that transaction.</p>
<p><strong>We may share information in an aggregated or other non-personally identifiable form. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We may share information as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You have certain choices about how we use your information.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can opt out of receiving our marketing emails. </strong>To stop receiving our promotional emails, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">click here</span> or follow the instructions in any promotional message you get from us. You may still receive transactional messages. Also, if you opt out, we may not provide to you non-promotional material, such as our emailed newsletters and other content.</p>
<p><strong>You can control cookies and tracking tools. </strong>We may use cookies and other technologies to store information on your computer or mobile device. Advertising service vendors that serve ads on the Services may also use their own cookies or identifiers.</p>
<p>Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies. Opting out of browser cookies will not disable other technologies that we may use to collect information from you, including “flash cookies,” which cannot be controlled through your browser settings.</p>
<p>If you block cookies on your browser, certain features of the Services may not work. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking activities we have described in this Policy will stop. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific.</p>
<p><strong>You can control tools on your mobile devices. </strong>For example, you can turn off the GPS locator or push notifications on your mobile device. Each push notification has an “unsubscribe” link.</p>
<p><strong>You can opt-out of targeted advertising. </strong></p>
<p>The advertisements on the Services may be provided by us, or they may be provided by a third-party vendor. These advertisements may be targeted, which means that advertisers want to reach a certain type of audience, and your information may be used in order to serve advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you. One of our advertising vendors, Google Inc. displays ads on our Services. If you would like more information about its practices, including information on how to opt-out, please click here: http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/ or if you would like to manage your advertising preferences, please click here: <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/</a>.</p>
<p>In some instances, we and advertisers on the Services work with ad networks and analytics providers which use cookies or other online technologies to collect information about your online activity such as type of pages viewed and categories of interests. Many third party vendors that that perform these functions are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance, and you can opt out of those vendors’ delivery of targeted advertising to you by visiting <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>
<p>We do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>Choices you make are both browser and device-specific. Some web browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature. This feature lets you tell websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. These features are not yet uniform across browsers. Our sites are not currently set up to respond to those signals.</p>
<p><strong>The Services and children</strong>.</p>
<p>Our Services are meant for adults. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 without permission from a parent or guardian. If you are a parent or legal guardian and think your child under 13 has given us information, you can <a href="mailto:privacy@suntimes.com">email</a> us at privacy@suntimes.com. You can also write to us at the address listed at the end of this Policy. Please mark your inquiries “COPPA Information Request.”</p>
<p><strong>We use standard security measures.</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is not 100% secure. We cannot promise that your use of our Services will be completely safe. We encourage you to use caution when using the Internet. This includes not sharing your passwords. We keep personal information as long as it is necessary or relevant for the practices described in this Policy. We also keep information as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p><strong>We store information in the United States.</strong></p>
<p>If you live outside of the United States, you understand and agree that we may transfer your information to the United States. This site is subject to U.S. laws, which may not afford the same level of protection as those in your country.</p>
<p><strong>We may link to other sites or have third party services on our site we don’t control.</strong></p>
<p>If you click on a link to a third party site, you will be taken to websites we do not control. This includes sites that may include our logo because we partner with that company. This Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of that website. That website sets its own cookies, collects data and /or has its own privacy practices. Read the privacy policy of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for these third party sites. Our site may also serve third party ads or content that contains the third party’s own cookies or tracking technologies. We do not control the use of those technologies.</p>
