Data Privacy Statement**

**Our Approach to Privacy**

To provide you with the best customer experience, Digitel Mobile Philippines, Inc. is committed to protecting your privacy and staying transparent with the way we handle your personal information. For this we have designed a privacy policy that will help you understand how we collect, use, store, share and protect the personal information you have entrusted us. 

**Privacy Policy**

Our privacy policy values and protects your personal information under the Data Privacy Act of 2012 and the laws of the Philippines. Personal information simply means  **any information or data that can be used to distinguish, identify or contact you.  **

Our Privacy Policy explains:

  * Why we collect personal information
  * What kind information we collect 
  * Where we get these information
  * Who we share your information with
  * How we protect your information
  * Your choices, including how you can check and update any personal information we have about you
  * What happens if there are changes in our privacy policy



As a condition for use of our products and services, you are consenting to the Privacy Policy of Digitel Mobile Philippines, Inc. (we, our, us) and its subsidiaries, affiliates, and subcontractors; and the collection, use, access, transfer, storage and processing of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Why we collect personal information  **

To improve our products and services, it is important that we collect, use, process and analyze your personal information when it is reasonable and necessary. When we can, we aggregate and anonymize this information such that you are never identified as an individual.  _[Aggregating simply means presenting information in segments or categories like age groups; anonymizing means removing personally identifiable information from the data].  _

In particular, we are using your information to:

  1. Manage your account, provide customer care activities, monitor the quality and security of the network, train our staff, and provide services timely and efficiently;
  2. Send commercial and promotional advertisements, loyalty and rewards offers, surveys, customer care and aftersales communications, and other broadcast push messages;
  3. Share your personal data with third-party content providers or other third-party services for which you sign up;
  4. Conduct analysis for research and marketing initiatives, including the generation of anonymized or non-personally identifiable location and mobility data to show footfall, location patterns, crowd density, and other information that may be relevant for marketing purposes;
  5. Generate statistical insights based on usage/network information to assist the Government in planning for healthcare, disaster, and other similar initiatives;
  6. Run credit scoring programs and initiatives, including but not limited to, providing information to the Credit Information Corporation in accordance to Republic Act No. 9501, otherwise known as the Credit Information System Act; and
  7. Perform such other processing or disclosure that may be required under law or regulations.



In cases where your separate and full consent is given, we are also processing your personal data to:

  1. Create your personal profile based on your interests, preferences, mobility patterns from physical locations that you may visit, and other information that may be relevant for marketing and market research purposes;
  2. Share your personal profile based on your interests, preferences, and mobility patterns from physical locations that you may visit, to our business partners and third-party service providers;
  3. Compute your credit score based on data collected internally within the PLDT Group and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and share your credit score to third-parties to whom you specifically instruct us to share your credit score; and
  4. Send you information on offers, promotions, and advertisements from our business partners and third-party service providers.
