We collect only the information we need for the purposes we have identified to you.

Our files are kept for the purpose of providing and servicing financial and insurance products and services that we believe are right for you, over your lifetime.

We will not sell your personal information.

**Why we need the information**

Generally, we need to collect personal information to:

  * understand your needs,
  * determine your eligibility,
  * continue to offer you the full range of products and services that we believe meet your changing needs and to service such products and services,
  * meet regulatory or contractual requirements and implement risk management programs and procedures relating to the services and products provided to you.



We will make sure you understand why we need the information by using clear, understandable language.

**We will obtain your permission**

We collect, use or disclose your personal information with your permission.

Your permission may be expressed in writing or be implied and you may give it to us verbally, electronically, or through your authorized representative.

You may withdraw your permission to collect, use and disclose your personal information at any time, subject to legal and contractual restrictions and reasonable notice.

Where medical information about you is collected or released, we will obtain your consent to do so. We will not share it with other members of the Sun Life Financial group of companies.

Before we make information available to third parties, other than an agent or service provider who needs it, we will tell you at the time we obtain your consent or before we make the information available, who those persons or organizations are, the kind of information we want to share with them and why.

**We will limit how long we keep information**

We will keep your personal information as long as it is necessary, including updating the product or service or as required by law.

When we destroy personal information, we will use safeguards to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the information during the process.

**We will protect your personal information**

**We are responsible for your information**

We are responsible for all personal information in our possession, including information transferred to a third-party service provider or agent, so that we can provide you with a product or service. In some instances our employees, service providers, agents, reinsurers and any of their service providers, may be located in jurisdictions outside Canada, and your personal information may be subject to the laws of those foreign jurisdictions.  All such persons, whether or not they are located in Canada, are required to protect the confidentiality of your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our privacy policy and practices.

**How we protect information**

Access to your personal information is restricted to those of Sun Life Financial's employees, agents and authorized service providers who need it to do their jobs.

We have developed and are continuing to enhance security procedures to safeguard and protect personal information against loss, theft, unauthorized disclosure, copying, and unauthorized use or modification. We will maintain appropriate safeguards and security procedures that reflect the types of documents, including electronic or paper records, organizational measures including security clearances and limiting access on a "need-to-know" basis, and technological measures such as the use of passwords and encryption. While we endeavour to protect all information, the most sensitive information, such as medical information, receives the highest level of protection. 

**Your right to access your personal information**

**Your rights**

You have the right to ask whether we hold any personal information about you and to see that information, as provided by law. Where we have obtained medical information about you from a third-party, we will release this information only through your physician.

You also have the right to know:

  * how we collected your personal information,
  * how we are using it, and
  * to whom it may have been disclosed.



**How to request an update or correction**

If you believe any of the information we have collected about you is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to ask us to change it.

If you show that your personal information is inaccurate or incomplete, we will make the necessary changes.

If you feel we have not dealt with your request to your satisfaction, you can follow our complaint resolution procedures.

**How to register complaints**

You may register a privacy-related complaint by contacting Sun Life Financial's Canadian Privacy Officer. We will explain Sun Life Financial's Canadian complaint procedure to you and investigate all complaints.
