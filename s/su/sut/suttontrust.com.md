  1. **What we collect**



We only collect a minimal amount of personal information. This includes information you give when signing up to our newsletter (name, e-mail address, job title) or communicating with us. This also includes information about individuals who are (or are employed by) stakeholders, for example an MP, chief-executive of a not-for-profit organisation, journalist, or comparable individual. This information includes name, job title, organisation, and contact information (e-mail).

We collect this information through various means including:

  * yourself;
  * from our research into stakeholders with an interest in topics relevant to the Sutton Trust’s aims using public sources such as websites;
  * from our research into journalists using public sources such as websites;
  * recommendations from other stakeholders;
  * recommendations from staff members of the Sutton Trust;
  * business cards received at events


  2. **Why we collect it**



**Our use of your personal information** | **Our legal basis for processing your personal information**  
---|---  
We use your personal information to send you our e-newsletter, which includes all our marketing communications such as our research programme, including details of recent reports or blogs; our events and activities; job opportunities. | We will only contact you in this way if you have given us your consent to do so.  If you withdraw your consent for us to contact you with this information, we will no longer use your contact details in this way.  
We use your personal information to organise events; to update stakeholders on relevant policy events and reports; to communicate with journalists on relevant news, events and reports. | It is in our legitimate interest to inform stakeholders of the work we are doing. Stakeholders may find our reports/events informative and useful in shaping the discussion on these issues. Also at times we may want the input of stakeholders into the policy debate. If you are a stakeholder and you are receiving communications from us, but do not wish to do so anymore, then let us know at info@suttontrust.com and we will no longer contact you in this way.  
We use your personal information where it is publicly available including party affiliation, individual interests (according to publicly available reports or from Hansard) and previous voting record to segment what information we send to stakeholders. | This activity is in our legitimate interest so that we are only sending information to you that would be of interest.  
We use your personal information to conduct research reports (i.e. using publicly available information on Members of Parliament). | This activity is in our legitimate interest to conduct relevant and proper research to further our aim of improving social mobility. Some personal information will be provided to us by the individual strictly for research purposes on the basis of consent.  
We use website usage data and user data (such as your IP address and details of your browser and device) to provide products and services; to enable certain website functions; to better understand how visitors use this website; and to present timely and relevant information to visitors. | This activity is in our legitimate interest to help ensure the website operates properly.  
  
Where we have a contractual relationship with you, we may process your personal information as necessary for the performance of that contract or prior to entering into it.

  3. **What we do with your data**



For our research, all data held internally is anonymised, apart from where the information on the individual is publicly available (i.e. Members of Parliament). When published, all results are anonymised and any personal information is retained internally.

Occasionally, where we partner with other organisations, we may share information with them (for example, if you register to attend an event being jointly organised by us and another charity). We’ll only share information when necessary and we will never share your contact information (e.g. email or telephone).

  4. **Where we keep it**



Your data will be retained and stored confidentially and processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act (1998) and General Data Protection Regulation (2018) principles.

Your data will be stored on The Sutton Trust’s shared drive. We are based in the UK and store our data within the EU.

We may use the following third-party service providers named below to process and store your data:

  * Mailchimp (The Rocket Science Group, LLC), which we use to manage email marketing subscriber lists and send emails to our subscribers. Read their [privacy policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/).
  * Google Analytics, which we use to measure the performance of this website. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site. Search queries and results are also logged anonymously in Google Analytics to help us improve our website and search functionality. Read their [privacy policy](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html). You can opt-out of Google Analytics cookies altogether by [opting-out of the browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).
  * Automattic, Inc., whose WordPress software (and associated add-ons) we use to manage the content of this website. Read their [privacy policy](https://automattic.com/privacy/).



**      5.  How long we keep it**

The Trust will store information only for the purposes for which it was collected and continually review our retention periods to ensure that personal data is not stored unnecessarily.

Personal data associated with research will be stored for 10 years, unless it is still considered necessary for research purposes. For all our personal data we will perform an annual check to ensure that:

  * stakeholders are still working at the organisations and in relevant roles within those organisations to justify inclusion on our data-base;
  * media contacts are up to date and relevant;
  * personal data associated with research is up to date, and still needed for research purposes (for example we would retain information on individuals who still hold the prominent positions which our research examines, such as those who remain Members of Parliament, as this information would be vital for future analysis. However, if that individual is no longer an MP or a candidate for parliament, they would be deleted from our database).



If not, your personal information is deleted.

Our websites include social media features, such as the ‘Facebook Like’ button. These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you are visiting on our website, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly.

We value our relationship with you and would like to send you relevant communications, offering beneficial services, thanking you for your support, sharing future opportunities for providing support which may be of interest to you, and measuring the impact of the programmes we run.

We are committed to protecting your personal information and being transparent about what we do with it. This Privacy Notice sets out the information that we collect about you in respect of our core and alumni programmes, why and how we use that information in relation to our core and alumni activities, the legal basis upon which we process that information, your rights regarding that information and how you can update it.

In this policy, references to ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘our’ means the Sutton Trust of 9th Floor Millbank Tower, 21-24 Millbank, London SW1P 4QP. We are the data controller for the personal data relating to you that we collect and hold.

We collect, use and hold a range of data about you, and we refer to this as “personal information” or “personal data” throughout this policy. Annexe A details the categories of personal information that we collect about you, which includes data like your personal and contact details, communications and volunteering preferences, your Sutton Trust programme, your suitability for our programmes and your attainment, your professional details, your relationship to other alumni and your current and potential support for the Sutton Trust.

In this policy, all of the personal information described above is also referred to as “ **Alumni Personal Information** “, and is distinct from the cookie information that we collect about you, referred to below:

  * Cookie data: We collect information about how you use and navigate our website, via the use of cookies. For more information about the cookies we use, please see section 9 of this policy (below).


  3. **How we obtain your data**



Most of the data we hold is from the information you provided to the Sutton Trust when you registered for your programme, or is information you provided when you created or edited your alumni profile (through our online platform, “Sutton Trust Alumni” or our previous digital software). You may also have provided information over email, post, over the phone, or in conversation. Where relevant and feasible, and in a manner appropriate to the way in which the data is collected, at the point when Alumni Users update their data outside of Sutton Trust Alumni, for example over email or other digital means, over the phone, or in person, the following points will be made: that the Sutton Trust is collecting your personal information; the reasons for our collection of your data; your rights in relation to our collection of data ; and the location of our full privacy statement.

We sometimes obtain information about you from publicly available sources. For example, social networking sites, company websites, publications like Who’s Who, dedicated business websites (e.g. Companies House) or publications and articles in the media (e.g. Queen’s Honours List), and may use trusted external companies to do this on our behalf.

If you agree to us sharing your personal information with our alumni programme delivery partners, they will share additional personal information with us about your engagement with them. We have provided more information about the data that we share with, and receive from, our partners in section 5 below.

We also analyse personal data we collect about you to create additional information about you. For example, to assess your level of engagement, your likelihood and capacity to donate or volunteer and potential areas of interest for future communications. We use this information to help us to improve the alumni relations programme, including our fundraising programme.

**5\. Sharing your data**

**5a. Delivery partners  
**To deliver your programme, The Trust will have shared your full application with the university you applied to. We will have also shared your contact details and access needs with other delivery partners to deliver the programme. i.e. a work experience placement provider.

We also work with select partners to deliver parts of the alumni relations programme. If you choose to interact with these partners and give your (separate and additional) consent for us to do so, some of your personal information will be shared with those partners. This will include:

  * Your name
  * Your email address
  * Your current address
  * Any education history you have shared with us (degree, university, subject)



We do this in order to make the process of signing up for their services easier. In addition, our partners will tell us about your engagement with the opportunities and services they offer. This could include your attendance at events, the type of content you are interested in, or jobs you have applied for.

These partners will assess your eligibility for the programmes they run using their own systems. They will ask you for additional data, and are separately responsible for compliance in storing and processing the data The Trust has shared with them, in addition to any additional data you supply to them. They will be in touch to share their own procedures with you. If you have consented to us sharing your personal information with our delivery partners, and you subsequently change your mind or would like to exercise any of your rights in relation to the personal information that they hold about you, you will need to contact them to do so.

The partners we are currently working with are included in Annex B.

**5b. Sutton Trust programmes partners**

The Trust will share your data with our evaluation partners so they can evaluate the effectiveness of the programme.

As part of the alumni relations volunteering programme, some individuals who work for the partners who deliver our core programmes (for instance our Summer Schools) will also have accounts on Sutton Trust Alumni. This group of partners will contact you on the Sutton Trust Alumni portal regarding specific opportunities should you indicate that you are interested in hearing from them, either as part of the process of signing up to Sutton Trust Alumni, by making changes to your personal profile, or by indicating by email, phone, or in conversation with them that you would be interested in those opportunities.

Our partners will assess your eligibility for the programmes they run using their own systems. They are responsible for compliance in storing and processing your personal information, and they will be in touch to share their own procedures with you.

The partners we are currently working with are included in Annex B.

**5c. Evaluation partners**

The Trust will share your data with our evaluation partners so they can evaluate the effectiveness of the alumni relations programme, and the Sutton Trust’s core programmes (the programme to which you originally applied, for example a Summer School). Our evaluation partners are appointed each year and will vary depending on the programme. A list of the evaluation partners the Trust currently works with are included in Annex B.

We, or our partners, will ask you to complete surveys and will link these to the data you provide to us on Sutton Trust Alumni. We will also link the data you provide to additional educational data sets to evaluate your future educational and career outcomes. This will include looking at where you go to university and what jobs you do in future. We do this so that we can measure the impact that our programmes have on participants and ensure the programme is meeting its aims of increasing access to selective universities and careers.

We will not say anything in our reports that could identify you and will not use your data in a way that would affect you individually. We have data sharing agreements in place to ensure that your data is protected and partner organisations will adequately protect your data. The current data sets we will link to are included in Annex B.

**5d. Tracking**

The Trust looks at where you go to university and what jobs you do in the future. We do this so that we can measure the impact that our programmes have on participants and ensure the programme is meeting its aims of increasing access to selective universities and careers. Tracking will be undertaken by the Higher Education Access Tracker (HEAT) and we will share the following information to access the data sets:

  * Name
  * Date of birth
  * Postcode



A full list of the data sets the Trust may access are available in the Annex.

**5e. Other users of the Sutton Trust Alumni platform**

Sutton Trust Alumni is designed to foster connections between alumni of the Sutton Trust’s programmes. As such, many of the Alumni Personal Information you supply will be displayed to other users of the platform, including our partners who have access to the platform, as mentioned earlier. You have control over what information you would like to be shared and you can update this at any time by updating your personal profile (called ‘My Profile’), or by getting in touch with us.

**5f. Third party IT service providers**

We use a third-party IT service provider, Hivebrite to host and maintain the Sutton Trust Alumni portal and a CRM system called Salesforce. They will have access to personal information stored on Sutton Trust Alumni in their role as our IT service provider, but are not permitted to use your personal information for their own purposes, other than measuring the effectiveness of their services, and must only process your personal information in accordance with our instructions. Some of our third-party providers also utilise the services of other parties – for example Hivebrite uses Google analytics to track displays of traffic on the site. We require all third parties and their partners to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.

We are based in the UK and store our data within the EU. Some organisations which provide services to us may transfer personal data outside of the EU, but we will only allow them to do if your data is adequately protected. For example, Survey Monkey and Form Assembly who host our online surveys are US based companies. We have processing agreements in place with these organisations to ensure your data is adequately protected.

We will only collect criminal conviction data where it is appropriate given the nature of your role and where the law permits us. This data will usually be collected at the recruitment stage, however, may also be collected during your employment. We use criminal conviction data to determine your suitability, or your continued suitability for the role. We rely on the lawful basis of our legitimate interest to process this data.

  3. **What we do with your data**



Employees within our company who have responsibility for recruitment will have access to your data which is relevant to their function. All employees with such responsibility have been trained in ensuring data is processed in line with GDPR.

Data is shared with third parties for the following reasons: to support and advise on best practice within the HR function and occasionally executive search firms when recruiting roles at a Director level.

We may also share your data with third parties as part of a Company sale or restructure, or for other reasons to comply with a legal obligation upon us. We have a data processing agreement in place with such third parties to ensure data is not compromised. Third parties must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of your data.

We do not share your data with bodies outside of the European Economic Area.

3.1) Automated decision making

Automated decision-making means making decision about you using no human involvement e.g. using computerised filtering equipment. No decision will be made about you solely on the basis of automated decision making (where a decision is taken about you using an electronic system without human involvement) which has a significant impact on you.

  4. **Where we keep it**



We are aware of the requirement to ensure your data is protected against accidental loss or disclosure, destruction and abuse. We have implemented processes to guard against such.

  5. **How long we keep it**



We only keep your data for as long as we need it for, which, in relation to unsuccessful candidates, is six months once the recruitment exercise ends.

If your application is not successful and we have not sought consent or you have not provided consent upon our request to keep your data for the purpose of future suitable job vacancies, we will keep your data for six months once the recruitment exercise ends.

If we have sought your consent to keep your data on file for future job vacancies, and you have provided consent, we will keep your data for nine months once the recruitment exercise ends. At the end of this period, we will delete or destroy your data, unless you have already withdrawn your consent to our processing of your data in which case it will be deleted or destroyed upon your withdrawal of consent.

Where you have provided consent to our use of your data, you also have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This means that we will stop processing your data and there will be no consequences of withdrawing consent.

If your application is successful, your data will be kept and transferred to the systems we administer for employees. We have a separate privacy notice for employees, which will be provided to you.

We are committed to protecting your personal information and being transparent about what we do with it. This Privacy Notice sets out the information that we collect about you in respect of our fundraising programme, why and how we use that information in relation to fundraising activities, the legal basis upon which we process that information, your rights regarding that information and how you can update it.

In this policy, references to ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘our’ means the Sutton Trust of 9th Floor Millbank Tower, 21-24 Millbank, London SW1P 4QP. We are the data controller for the personal data relating to you that we collect and hold.
