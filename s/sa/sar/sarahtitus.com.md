# Full Disclosure & Privacy Policy - Sarah Titus

_Last updated: May 24, 2018._

Per the FTC regulations, this is a full explanation of how and when I am compensated on SarahTitus.com.

SarahTitus.com began as a way to reach out to many women who want the opportunity to be able to stay home with their little ones, but don’t know how to go about doing it. It was inspired by a majority of my friends and acquaintances wanting me to teach them these money saving tricks and skills, as well as how to make money from home to supplement their income once they quit their 9-5 jobs. As a lack of time grew in being able to teach each one of them on a personal level and in order to have the opportunity to reach millions of others at the same time, led by God, the site was born. Over time, as I got more involved and more and more readers were enjoying my content and spending quite a bit of time on the site in a desire to learn more, I became a full-time, professional blogger.

In order to keep all of my blog content free of charge, but still be able to pay all the costs associated with running an online business (hosting fees, domain name, blog design, my own time and that of those who help me), there are many ways in which I am compensated.

SarahTitus.com is a labor of love. Many people tell me I was born to blog, and I truly enjoy every minute of it and the impact it makes on others lives. I just also happen to receive funds for doing my ‘job’ and spreading that message.

## My opinions and morals

The integrity of SarahTitus.com is of the utmost importance to me. I will never promote anything that I fully do not believe in, even if offered to be compensated for it, and have turned down many offers as such in my time blogging. Likewise, I will not promote something that is not valuable to you, as my reader, even if I DO personally believe in it, nor would I promote anything that does not fit into the specified categories on this site.

If I say I like something, I do. If I say I hate something, I do. Most of the companies that I promote are companies that I have used long before I ever started a blog.

This blog is an outstretch of the hand of God, and what He has done in my life. If something doesn’t line up with that core mission, it will not even be considered. My witness as a Christian is the most important thing to me, and I will not sacrifice that for any amount of cash or personal relationships. Those that know me best, have seen this practice played out in my life.

## Underwritten Posts / Product Reviews

On occasion, I will accept a product review if it lines up with the sites’ overall theme, and I think you, as a reader, could benefit from the information. Never can my opinion be bought, and the product review is 100% my words, my opinions, and my thoughts with 100% honesty. If a product or service is mentioned, and you do not see the disclaimer on the page, I was not compensated for it. It just happened that I thought you might appreciate the information.

## Guest Posts

On occasion, I will accept guest posts to be written by others and published on this site, if they line up with the overall theme, and I think you would benefit from the information. Be assured that I only do this with individuals that I believe in, and would be of genuine interest to you.

## Affiliate Marketing

Another way in which I am compensated is through sales or leads generated through affiliate marketing links.

Again, it is important for me to mention that I will never put a link up just to make money. I am extremely picky over what I chose to promote, and everything is prayed over before making my decision. Most of the companies I have affiliate marketing accounts with, are ones that I have had before I began blogging, and have personally used myself throughout the years.

Some of my personal favorite companies that I use and promote are:

  * [ConvertKit](http://mbsy.co/convertkit/14204675)
  * [Amazon](https://www.sarahtitus.com/amazon.com) (I am a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associate Program)
  * [ING Image](https://www.ingimage.com/?urefid=IMSUSER:2535731A-0B09-7EDB-B63C3FCCB3B84C4E)
  * [BlueHost](http://www.bluehost.com/track/sarahtitus/)
  * [Share A Sale](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=69&u=840888&m=47&urllink=&afftrack=)
  * [ViralTag](https://www.viraltag.com/settings/referral#sthash.4iFNybPQ)
  * [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com/?u=forhisglory28)
  * [Ebates](http://www.ebates.com/rf.do?referrerid=ofjMICqOf362br%2BSFP77Ow%3D%3D&eeid=26471)
  * [OfferJuice](http://tracking.opinionoutpost.com/aff_c?offer_id=3255&aff_id=5143)
  * [Zyto Compass](https://www.zytocompass.com/af/stitus2)



Clicking on an affiliate link and making a purchase or signing up for a service will be earning me a commission and helping me to keep this blog free.

## Banner Ads

In my making money section, I accept whole-page banner ads for direct selling and network marketing companies. These companies must be approved by me and must be 100% legitimate companies. There are too many scams out there for work at home situations, and I do not take this section of the site lightly. These companies will only be ones that have a proven track record of being scam-free and safe to work for. The leaders who are promoted for each company also have been approved and there will only be one representative per company. I will not advertise two reps simultaneously. During the time frame that a representative has a whole-page banner ad placed on this site, other reps from the same company cannot be considered. This is done to avoid confusion for my readers. It is also done because I’m an extremely loyal type of person and would not want someone to do that to me.
