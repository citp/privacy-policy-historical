**Information you involuntarily provide and what we do with it**

As you click through the pages on the SAE website, our server logs information about your session on the site.

We use this information from our server logs to learn about our visitors as a group, not about you as an individual. This information helps us identify overall usage patterns and trends on the site. We may use this information for any of the following purposes: 

  * Identify how much traffic various areas of the site receive.

  * Determine the number of visitors from various countries. 
  * Optimize the site for common browsers used at the site. 
  * Track results of promotional campaigns.

_Information you provide when you send us email_

There are numerous email links on the site enabling you to send email to individuals or groups. When you send us an email and request a response, we use the email address you have provided to respond to your inquiry. We periodically log the nature of email requests we receive, which helps us analyze visitor interests overall and identify areas for improvement on the site. 

  
_Information you provide when you participate in online discussion forums_

If you participate in an online private team, your teammates may have access to your email address and other contact information. Some of this information comes from our database and some is provided by you. If you participate in activities in our public forums, others may have access to information about you that you voluntarily provide.

**What we store in our database about you**

We may check the information you have provided via any of our forms, email, or forums against any information we have about you in our customer database. We do this to ensure that we have the most current and accurate information about you as a valued customer. 

Our database may contain your name, title, affiliation, industry classification, address, phone and fax numbers, and email address, if you provide them. We also record your site registration user ID and password, as well as information about your participation with SAE--what magazines you prefer to receive if you are a member or subscriber, any offices you hold, what committees, councils, boards, or task forces you serve or have served on, your membership status, meetings you have attended, products you have purchased, etc. We may use this information to process any transactions you request. We may also use this information to inform you of new products and upcoming events that may be of interest to you, based on your participation in SAE, your interests in our products and activities, and industry codes you selected. 

**Use of "cookies" at the SAE website**

When you order products on the SAE website or log into specific areas of the site such as the online forums and member benefits area, our server puts a "cookie" on your computer. In addition, the SAE website carries banner advertisements from third-party ad servers that may or may not use cookies. A cookie is a short line of code that takes up a miniscule amount of room on your hard drive. Many websites use cookies to process online orders and maintain customer records.

SAE uses cookies to keep track of the products you are ordering on our site: the product code, description, price, and quantity. We need these pieces of information to process your order online. They also help the server identify who you are and your role with SAE to provide you with appropriate access to various areas of the site (online forums, member benefits, etc.) SAE does not sell or make available to other organizations any of the information in the cookies that its server sets on your harddrive.

Cookies that are set by SAE servers to process your online product order expire automatically from your computer 30 days after being put there. This allows you to visit our site, add products to your shopping cart, and come back up to a month later and resume shopping without losing what's in your cart. Of course, you can always empty your cart yourself.

Cookies that are used as part of the site login process when you visit various areas of the site (forums, member benefits, etc.) expire when you close your browser. 

You can disable the cookies function on your browser or erase the contents in your cookies file. To do this, consult the help features in your program manager and browser. The downside is that you won't be able to take advantage of our nifty online ordering system, participate in our onoline forums or access information you may otherwise be able to access (member benefits, for example).
