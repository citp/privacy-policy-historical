<h2><i>Information We Collect by Automated Means</i></h2>
<p>When you visit our Site, we may collect certain information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, Web server logs and Web beacons.</p>
<p>Cookies are files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser.  Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies.  Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Site.</p>  
<p>In conjunction with the gathering of information through cookies, our Web servers may log information such as your operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located.

<p>To control which Web servers collect information by automated means, we may place tags on our Web pages called “Web beacons,” which are small files that link Web pages to particular Web servers and their cookies.</p>  
<p>We may use third-party web analytics services on our Site, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use cookies and web beacons to help us analyze how users use the Site.
