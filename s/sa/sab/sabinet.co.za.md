If you wish to opt out of our use of your personally identifiable information see the "Your Consent; Opting out" section below. 

**Use of Cookies and Behavioural Targeting**

SABINET employs "cookie" technology. Cookies are small pieces of text that are stored on your computer and act as a tool for controlling certain system variables and storing system configuration information in the WWW environment. SABINET uses cookies to store user preferences for viewing and printing, regional and geographical information connected to an IP address, and to store authentication information. We do not use cookies to identify what other sites you have visited; however, we do use certain tools to understand the flow of traffic to and from SABINET websites. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service. Third party service providers may use cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, but those cookies are not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies, if used. Different cookies serve different purposes. While some cookies are used to control basic functions of the site, some cookies store basic user information in certain ways.  Some cookies that are essential to your use of a SABINET site have already been set. You may delete and block all cookies from the site, but certain sites may not work without cookies. 

SABINET uses the following types of cookies:

These cookies are used to collect information about how users interact with each of the SABINET sites. This information is also used to compile reports to help SABINET improve the respective site, including reports on the number of visitors to the site, where the visitors have come from and what pages the users visit on the site. Third party cookies may also be used to assist users with support and diagnose identified issues with SABINET sites.   
  
**Other Tracking Technologies and Automated-Decision Making Practices**

As with most web sites, SABINET gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you. 

Through this policy, we will notify individuals of any automated-decision making practices we may engage in regarding PII, including the logic involved and the significance of the decision as well as the consequences for you. We also will ensure that you may opt out of such automated-decision making practices. 

**Widgets**

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets such as the ShareThis button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site ("Features"). These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Features to function properly. Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Feature. 

**Onward Transfer of Information**

SABINET may work with other organizations that provide specific services for us, such as credit card processing. We will provide only the personal information necessary for the third party to provide these services for us. These organizations may not use personal information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

SABINET may also transfer personally identifiable information to third parties, including third parties located internationally, such as applicable publishers, other content providers, and libraries, who can better assist with your inquiries, to facilitate order fulfilment and to enable them to inform users of services provided by SABINET and/or the third parties' products and services that may be of interest. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate security measures. In addition, when transferring personally identifying information that is subject to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), we require a GDPR-approved transfer mechanism to be in place, such as Binding Corporate Rules or Privacy Shield Certification. 

SABINET does not sell or share personal information about or the purchasing history of individual users, except as set forth above and in the following circumstances:

  * In certain situations, SABINET may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. If required to do so by law or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with the law or a legal proceeding; to protect against violations of our Terms and Conditions of Use; or to protect and defend our rights and property or the rights and property of rights holders whose content is made available through the SABINET Websites and services; with service providers with whom we have entered into agreements to assist us with our business operations; 
  * If SABINET is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information; 



In addition, SABINET may share general usage data in aggregated form so that no personal information is identifiable to participating institutions, content providers, researchers, and the general public.

Upon request SABINET will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. If you would like to review, delete or update your information, you may contact us using the contact information below. We will permit you to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

You will need to provide sufficient identifying information, such as your name and email address and possible additional identifying information as a security precaution. 

**Data Retention**

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services or required by law.

**Enforcement and Dispute Resolution**

We engage in periodic self-assessment to ensure compliance with our Privacy Policy. We verify that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented, and where applicable, in conformity with the GDPR. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns with us using the contact information below. We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this policy.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, European Union data subjects may seek an administrative or judicial remedy or to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of his or her habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if the data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to him or her infringes the GDPR.
