Since most  of the users of our products and Sites are doing so in their capacity as  employees or companies, most Business Information we collect will be in that  capacity (rather than information about you individually, such as your personal  tastes, etc.). For these purposes, we have defined "Business Information"  as any information that identifies or may identify a company or an individual  contact at a company or that allows others to contact a company or an  individual contact at a company. When you visit the Sites, you may be asked to  submit information such as email address, company name, address, phone number,  your product version, and/or areas of interest. We may also ask you where you  heard about our company or products, or for other information that will help us  understand more about your needs or help us process your requests for  information. In addition, we collect credit card and related payment  information when you order products, services, or support plans online. Our  information collection and use practices are described in more detail below:</p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>
                <p><strong>Product Registration.</strong> You may be asked, on behalf of your company, to complete       registration/activation form(s) on the Sites or from within the products,       with contact information for use by us in accordance with this policy.       Registration or activation information may include the name of your       company, contact information, product information, customer ID, network       and operating system, and other relevant information. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Customer Profile.</strong> We also collect Business Information when you create a customer       profile or Passport account on some of the Sites, which is required in       order to access certain areas of the Sites, purchase support plans and       products, to obtain software downloads and certain online support       services, and to request information from us about our products and services.       This information includes company name and contact information and other       information about your company (for example, size, revenue, and number of       employees), the products you may have licensed, and other non-Sage       products you may currently use. We use this information in accordance with       this policy to identify you, process your requests, and administer your       Sage account(s).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Support.</strong> We offer certain limited online support services at the Sites. If you       access online support on any of the Sites, you may be asked for       information such as customer ID, product name, product version, and other       information to help us determine what the technical issues are and how       best to help you resolve them. In addition, certain products allow you to       submit support-related questions directly from the product. If you access       online support services from a product, information about your network,       operating system, printer, data and program path, product type, version,       customer ID, the product's technical support information sheet, product       serial number, and other similar information will be automatically       pre-populated for submission to our customer support representatives to       assist them in answering your questions. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Newsletters.</strong> When you subscribe or sign up to receive newsletters published or       offered via the Sites, we will ask you for information necessary to enable       us to process your request and to send you information regarding our       products and services. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> We also use Cookies to enhance the user experience, deliver       personalized content, and collect information about the use of the Sites.       "Cookies" are small computer files that we transfer to your computer's       hard drive. Cookies allow us to statistically monitor how many people are       using the Sites and for what purposes, how often someone visits the Sites,       and the length of their stay. This information helps us dynamically       generate advertising and information specifically designed for your       interests. We also use Cookies to prevent you from having to re-enter your       identification and password information each time you visit our Sites.       Cookies are not designed to retrieve personal or business data from your hard       drive, your email, or any other personal information. Most browsers are       initially set to accept Cookies, but users can change the setting to       refuse Cookies or to be alerted when Cookies are being sent. Although       refusal of Cookies will not interfere with the ability to interact with       most of the Sites, you will need to accept Cookies in order to access       information and use certain functions. For example, Cookies are required       to be accepted for access to our web-based services or desktop products       with online features. The Cookies are renewed each time a user logs on to       one of the Sites that uses Cookies. </p>

During the download       and registration process, we collect Business Information, including customer       ID number and product version, type, and serial number, in order to       authorize your access and provide you with the appropriate update, and to       update our records as to the product and products updates you have       downloaded or installed. </p>
              </li>

Certain products provide you       with the ability to access your account in order to obtain information       such as your support plan status, service subscriptions, registrations,       and order history. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Online Product/Account Application.</strong> Certain products and services are subject to an       application and enrollment process, which may be completed on paper or       online. Information requested may include federal ID numbers, bank       account, payroll, credit card, and contact information. This information       is used to process your enrollment request and, if approved, to set up and       administer your account. </p>

For example, we might inform third parties  regarding the number of users of the Sites and the activities they conduct  while on the Sites.

We combine industry-standard technical safeguards with a  code of conduct for those employees who are permitted to access our customers'  Business Information. When you purchase a product or service online, we use SSL  encryption to encrypt your credit card information before it is sent to us in  order to ensure the integrity and privacy of the credit card information that  you provide to us via the Internet.<br>
            <br>
            Many of our web-based services are hosted on servers that  are co-located at a third-party facility with whom we have a contract providing  for security measures. For example, hosted Services Data is submitted via SSL  encryption and stored on a server equipped with industry standard firewalls.<br>

Individual records of Customer Data  may be viewed or accessed by authorized Sage employees, agents or independent  contractors only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issues, or  suspected violation of the service or license agreement, or as may be required  by law. Sage policy requires that both employees and consultants execute a  confidentiality agreement before working for and with Sage.
