With respect to all accounts, we do not collect any Personal Information about you unless it is voluntarily provided by you.

In addition, in order to support the internal operations of the Site, we may also collect nonpersonally identifiable information, such as IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, duration and frequency of visits, and other data, and may aggregate any information collected in a manner which does not identify any individual ("Aggregate Information").

Information Usage

We will use the Personal Information that we collect solely for the use and benefit of the School, including providing the Site's educational services to its registered accounts. We do not use the Personal Information we collect for commercial purposes not related to the provision of the services requested by the School. For instance, we do not use any Personal Information in connection with online behavioral advertising or building user profiles for commercial purposes. Nor do we sell any Personal Information to third parties or mass marketers.

Only we and our affiliates, our technical consultants, third party auditors and other third parties who make our Site available, enhance its functionality, or provide associated services and/or who deal with you in delivering content have access to this information, and we require them to agree that they are covered by this policy.

Please note that, though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, Sadlier reserves the right to and may disclose Personal Information about you in response to (a) requests from local, state or federal law enforcement officials; (b) any judicial, administrative or similar proceeding or order, such as subpoena; (c) if required by law; or (d) to investigate suspected fraud, harassment, physical threats, or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, the Site rules or policies, or the rights of third parties or to investigate any suspected conduct which we deem improper. Please also note that we do reserve the right to transfer your Personal Information and other information to our successors in business and purchasers of Site assets.

Use of Cookies

The Site may pass a "cookie" (a string of information that is sent by a web site to be resident on your system's hard drive, and/or temporarily in your computer's memory blocks). The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a particular page. The Site may use cookies to support the internal operations of the Site, such as allowing you access to passwordprotected areas of the Site. You may set your browser to decline cookies. If you do so, however, you may not be able to fully experience some interactive features of the Site.

Children's Online Privacy

We are dedicated to the privacy of children, particularly children under 13 years of age. This Site is not intended for registration by children, including any children under the age of 13, and we have no intention of allowing children to register accounts for themselves for the Site. If a child under 13 has registered an account for him/herself on this Site, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database. Please note, however, that there are sections of this Site that children may access without registration (including sections where children can play games and download materials) and we do not collect Personal Information from children on these sections of the Site.

If a parent or legal guardian would like to refuse to allow any further collection or use of their child's Personal Information, please contact your child's Teacher or School Administrator. If the request is made to us directly, we will direct you to your child's Teacher or School Administrator to validate the request and respond accordingly.

We are dedicated to maintaining the privacy of all students, whether under 13 or older, in accordance with applicable laws. In this regard, we will maintain any and all Personal Information in education records which come into our possession in accordance with the requirements of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"), and will not disclose such information to third parties except with the consent of a parent, the School or an eligible student (as applicable), unless otherwise permitted under FERPA and its associated regulations.

Security 

Sadlier will not be liable for disclosures of your Personal Information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. We have undertaken all commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized Internet access to visitor data retained in our servers, however, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, Sadlier cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or any information provided online, and you do so at your own risk.
