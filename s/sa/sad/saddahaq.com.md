This Privacy and Security Policy ("Policy") applies to the Services offered by Viven. This Policy describes Viven's use and sharing of information received from persons accessing or using the Services ("User") whether he/she is a "Visitor" (which means that User simply browses the Website, or otherwise uses the Services without being registered with Viven) or is a "Member" (which means that User has registered with Viven). Viven adheres to the applicable laws regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information. 

Viven's Policy is subject to change at any time without notice. The User shall review the Policy periodically to make sure that he/she is aware of any changes to it. The User agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Policy while accessing the Website. If User does not agree with the terms and conditions of the Policy, he/she should not use or access the Website. 

The Policy is incorporated into "Terms of Use" and is subject to the terms laid down therein. 

* Information Collected from User 

**1.1.** When User registers with Viven or uses the Services, Viven may ask the User to provide information such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which includes any information about the User that could reasonably be used to identify him/her in person, such as the User's name, address, email address, date of birth or phone number ("Personal Information"), and (2) information relating to any communication that the User may have with Viven or any other User using any of the Services offered on the Website such as e-mails, chat room, discussion boards, IM communications, forum communications, membership on mailing lists, etc. ("Communication Information"). 

**1.2.** 1.2. In addition to any Personal Information that User chooses to submit to Viven, Viven and its third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information, including but not limited to usernames, passwords, and other security related information in relation to the usage of the Website, whenever User visits or utilizes the Services ( **"Usage Information"** ). Viven automatically receives and records information that User's browser sends whenever User visits the Website. Further, these server logs may include information such as User's IP address or a unique identifier ( **"Device Identifier"** ), browser type, browser language, the date and time of User's request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify User's browser from his/her computer or other device used to access the Services ("Device"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to User's Device used to access the Services, and Viven's computers identify User's Device by its Device Identifier. 

**1.3.** Cookies (data file placed on a Device when it is used to access the Services) may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering User and User's preferences and tracking User's visits to the Website. Viven uses temporary and permanent cookies when User signs in, to identify him/her and keep track of his/her personal session. All such information is securely stored, and no Personal Information is stored on User's cookie. If User chooses to disable the cookies on his/her Device, some features of the Services may not function properly. If User chooses to allow the cookies on his/her Device, User is hereby permitting Viven to use the Information collected by the cookies. 

**1.4.** Viven uses aggregate data collected in log files and cookies to enhance or otherwise improve the Services, ascertain User's preference, to customize the advertising and content User sees, retrieval of information already provided by the User on the Website, improve the Services, develop new services, conduct research, etc. These cookies and log files do not store User’s Personal Information, but they are tied to User's Personal Information in Viven's system. 

**1.5.** Viven uses session ID cookies to make it easier for User to navigate through the Website. Session ID cookies expire upon one week of inactivity or when User closes his/her browser whichever is shorter. Viven also uses a persistent cookie that remains on User's hard drive for an extended period of time, so that Viven can recognize such User when he/she returns to the Website. 

**1.6.** Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as **"1x1GIFs"** or **"clearGIFs"** ) may be present on the Website. Web beacons may be invisible to the User, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into the Website can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count Users of the Services, to monitor how Users navigate the Services, to count how many sent e-mails were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a User's computer hard drive, clearGIFs are embedded invisibly on the Website. Viven does not tie web beacons to Personal Information. 

**1.7.** Further, a programming code that is designed to collect information about User's interactions with the Services ( **"Embedded Script"** ) is temporarily downloaded onto User’s Device from Viven's web server. However, such Embedded Script is active only while User is connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. 

**1.8.** Any User accessing or using the Website from any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, protection and disclosure, that differ from Indian laws, understands and accepts that through his/her continued use of the Services, he/she is transferring his/her personal information to India and he/she consents to that transfer in compliance with the legal provisions on the subject matter as applicable in India, in addition to the Terms of Use and this Policy.
