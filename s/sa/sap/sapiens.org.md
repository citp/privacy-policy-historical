This Privacy Policy applies regardless of media platform (e.g., computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.) used to access our Websites.

Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy is designed to make clear our intentions and approach to the collection and use of personal information in connection with our Websites and the choices you have.

Please contact us at [inquiries@wennergren.org](mailto:inquiries@wennergren.org) if:

  * You have any questions about this Privacy Policy

  * You would like to receive your personal data in a machine-readable format and send it to another controller



 **YOUR CONSENT; OPTING-OUT**

By using the Websites, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using the Websites. Specifically, by using our websites and submitting any  **Personal Information**  (as defined below in “Information We Collect & How We Collect It”) to us, you consent and agree that we may collect, use, and disclose that information (including information which may be personally identifiable) in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and as permitted or required by law. You have the option of refraining from submitting  **Personal Information**  and reviewing, updating, correcting and deleting  **Personal Information**  you have submitted (by contacting us at [inquiries@wennergren.org](mailto:inquiries@wennergren.org)), and can limit your use of the Websites to those aspects that do not require  **Personal Information**  if you do not agree with our practices outlined in this Privacy Policy regarding  **Personal Information**. You can also request that we refrain from using **Personal Information** for certain uses described in this Privacy Policy (by contacting us a [inquiries@wennergren.org](mailto:inquiries@wennergren.org)). You can also opt-out of our collection of **Website User Information** by refraining from visiting our website or rejecting or deleting cookies (see Website User Information & Cookies/Web Beacons/Tracking below).    

 **INFORMATION WE COLLECT & HOW WE COLLECT IT**

For the purposes of operating, improving, and monitoring the user experience on our Websites and our operations generally, we collect various information from those using the Websites. This information is broadly of two types: (1)  **Personal Information**  (information which is personal to you and can be used to identify you, such as your name and email address) and (2)  **Website User Information**  (such as the number of users—but not their names—who have viewed an article; in some jurisdictions, some of this Website User Information, such as IP address, may be deemed to be personal information) **.**

Website User Information & Cookies/Web Beacons/Tracking

When you access our Websites, we may collect  **Website User Information**  including, but not limited to, pages visited, hyperlinks used, type of device used, date, and time spent on our Websites.

Collecting such  **Website User Information**  may involve logging the IP address, operating system and browser software used by individual site visitors. From such information a user’s Internet Service Provider and other data could be inferred, but cannot be used to personally identify you. We use this information to understand how to service users of our Websites and improve our Websites and programs by using Google Analytics or other website analysis tools.

We may also use cookies, flash cookies, web beacons, tags, and/or other technologies to store and help track information about you to provide you with a customized and personal service. Most browsers are initially set to accept such technologies and offer easy instructions on setting your browser to reject some or all of them. For example, you may choose to delete cookies at any time. However, please note that various personalized functions and benefits of the Websites may not work properly if you reject our cookies or other web technologies.

We do not track visitors across third party websites to provide targeted advertising, and therefore do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.

Personal Information

You can access content on our Websites and use most features of our Websites without revealing any  **Personal Information.** We only collect  **Personal Information**  when you provide it to us directly (or as noted in the Website User Information), for example:

  * When you register for an account on the Websites to submit a grant application or otherwise;
  * If you register with us to receive email newsletters or other communications from us;
  * If you contact us through the Websites;
  * When you participate in surveys;
  * When you participate with social media accounts operated by Wenner-Gren;
  * If you register for and participate in our programs, activities, initiatives, and events;
  * When you provide User Content (as defined in the [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://www.sapiens.org/terms-use/)) such as comments or written submissions to SAPIENS on any part of the Websites that permit it; and
  * When we need to verify your account information.



When you interact with any Wenner-Gren and SAPIENS page or account on a social media platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Tumblr, YouTube, or Pinterest (collectively, “Wenner-Gren Social Media”), or when you use your social media account or credentials to log into the Websites, we may also collect the  **Personal Information  **that you make available to us on that page or through that account. (Please note that when you use third party social media platforms, your use of those platforms is governed by their privacy policies and not this Privacy Policy.)

Collection of Personal Information by Third Party

The Websites use third party services to collect  **Personal Information**  for certain activities, such as its online grant application, managing email communications, and posting user comments. Use of  **Personal Information**  is controlled both by this Privacy Policy and the privacy policies and practices of those third party service providers. If we are using a third party service to collect  **Personal Information  **in connection with a feature we offer on our Websites, we will provide you with a link to the service provider’s privacy policy.

 **HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We use  **Personal Information** collected in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was intended to use.Specifically, we use personal information in any of the following ways:

  * To indicate that you are the author of User Content (as defined in our [Terms and Conditions of Use](http://sapiens.org/terms-use/)) if you submit such content with your name;
  * To communicate with you periodically via email, if you have subscribed to one of our email lists;
  * To communicate with you in connection with processing your grant application or employment application;
  * To communicate with you about your account or any transactions with us;
  * To respond to you when you contact us. We may also archive this information and/or use it for future communications with you.
  * To contact you with service messages related to or affecting your use of our Websites, for example, to send you updates about changes in our terms or policies;
  * To send you marketing messages, special offers, promotions, and other information about us and our programs and services, and other products or services that we think may be of interest to you (see opt-out procedures in “Your Choices and Communications Preferences” below);
  * To facilitate your registration for an event or program;
  * To investigate any activities that may violate our policies or be illegal;
  * To manage and operate our Websites, and our organization in general.
