We use a feature of your internet browser called a 'cookie' on this website. A 'cookie' is a very small text file that your web browser places on your computer's hard drive which allows us to help you get the best out of your visit to the website and improve your user experience. A 'cookie' can be thought of as an identification card which tells a website when you have returned.  To read our Cookie Policy please click here.

### Links to other websites

Whilst we make every effort to provide you with links to other high quality, reputable websites, these websites are not under our day to day control.  Therefore we cannot accept responsibility for any issues arising in connection with their use of your information, the website content or the services offered to you by these websites.  We advise you to consult the privacy policy and terms and conditions on each website to see how each supplier may process your information.

We treat all the information we hold securely and with the utmost care. 

Your payment details are stored on our system in an encrypted format and can only be accessed when you place an order using your user name or email address and password.

Please be aware that we will only ever contact customers requesting confirmation of account details if your card is declined at the point of payment (this is not the same as the automatic pre authorisation which happens when you order your products online), or in certain circumstances when a refund to your card is required as Customer Care Team do not have access to your payment card details.
