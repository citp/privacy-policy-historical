## **11. **How do we store your personal information?****

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure the security of the personal information we collect and store about you. We will use all reasonable endeavours to protect your personal information from unauthorised disclosure and / or access, however unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and we have no control over the privacy of any communication while it is in transit to us. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information while it is being transmitted to our site. Accordingly, any transmission is at your own risk.

All information you provide to us is stored in secure managed servers and we will limit access to your personal data to those of our employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. Any payment transactions are encrypted using SSL technology, and payment details are not kept following completion of the transaction. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the website(s), you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You will be responsible for controlling access to your account and for any activity under your account and password. We therefore ask you not to share your password with anyone. We will not be liable for any loss or damage where you have not complied with this obligation.

Where we are legally required to do so, we will notify you and any applicable data protection authority or other regulator should there be an actual or suspected personal data breach involving your personal information.

## **12. **How long will you use my personal data for?****

We will only keep your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting obligations that we may have. We will only keep personal data for longer where there is a legal requirement for us to do so.

To determine how long we should keep your information for, we will consider the amount, type, and sensitivity of the personal information involved as well as the potential risk of harm if it is lost, or used or disclosed without authorisation. We will also consider the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means without the need to keep your data.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data (see section 15 below for more information).

In some circumstances, we may also anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you, for example for statistical purposes. Where we do this, we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

## 13\. **Opting In**

Sometimes, we will give you the option to choose whether you would like to receive information from us or not (e.g. by choosing to opt in to receiving emails from us with news about our brands or promotional offers). However, sometimes we will need to collect information from you by law or you will sometimes not have the option to opt out, such as when we are satisfying the obligations of a contract we have with you, or administering a transaction requested by you[, i.e. if you purchase products from us online]. In some circumstances, if you choose not to provide certain information, we may be unable to provide you with a certain service or product.

## 14\. **Sharing your personal data with others**

We may share your personal information with any member of our group of companies – this includes any of our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.

  2. we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of the company, our customers, or consumers or others.

We do not allow them to use your personal data for their own purposes. We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.

We will never share any of your personal data with anybody outside of our group of companies for third party mailing or marketing purposes unless we have your consent to do so.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**What we may need from you**

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

**Time limit to respond**

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

 **If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, or you have any concerns about how we process your information, please e-mail us at DataProtection@wgrant.com so that we can investigate and hopefully resolve your concerns.**

 **If we are unable to satisfactorily deal with your concerns then you have the right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority.**

## 16\. **How to unsubscribe or withdraw your consent**

Where we have collected your personal information based on your consent and we have no other lawful basis on which to continue processing your information, if you subsequently withdraw your consent we will delete your personal information.
