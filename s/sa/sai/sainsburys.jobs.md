### Cookies

Sainsbury's Online Recruitment use a feature of your Internet Web Browser called a 'Cookie' on our site. A Cookie is a file that your Web Browser places on your computer's hard disc which allows us to help you get the best out of your visit to the site.

Sainsbury's Online Recruitment uses Cookies to make accessing the site more convenient as you won't need to remember your user number. Cookies in conjunction with registration details will allow us to welcome you by name and over time personalise the site content to reflect your preferences. For security reasons you will still need to enter your password and where more than one user uses the same machine it will not be possible to offer this service. The Sainsbury's Online Recruitment Cookie will remain on your hard disk indefinitely.

If you prevent us from placing Cookies on your computer during your visit, then it will not be possible to use the site effectively because the system relies on the Cookie to keep track of the current order, your customer number and your session ID.

Please note that we do not use Cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer, unless the information has been knowingly and willingly been provided by you.

### Security

Sainsbury's treat all the data you provide us with the utmost care and security. Any details you give us will remain completely confidential.

We will never contact our candidates requesting confirmation of account details or passwords and we advise our candidates never to enter these details into an email or after following a link from an email. If you are contacted by our HR Shared Services team they will confirm your name and the role that you have applied for. Contact would be either by telephone, text or email using the contact numbers or email address supplied by you in your application.

### Your rights
