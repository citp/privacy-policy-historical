<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Sainsbury's Online Recruitment use a feature of your Internet Web Browser called a 'Cookie' on our site. A Cookie is a file that your Web Browser places on your computer's hard disc which allows us to help you get the best out of your visit to the site.</p>
<p>Sainsbury's Online Recruitment uses Cookies to make accessing the site more convenient as you won't need to remember your user number. Cookies in conjunction with registration details will allow us to welcome you by name and over time personalise the site content to reflect your preferences.

The Sainsbury's Online Recruitment Cookie will remain on your hard disk indefinitely.</p>
<p>If you prevent us from placing Cookies on your computer during your visit, then it will not be possible to use the site effectively because the system relies on the Cookie to keep track of the current order, your customer number and your session ID.</p>
