<br><br>
NeuLion, Inc., subsidiary DivX LLC, and related entities ("Company") are committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of our websites, located at www.neulion.com and www.divx.com ("Site") and Services (as defined in the Terms of Use). Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given in our Terms of Use located at http://www.neulion.com/terms-of-use.
<br><br>
1. User Consent. By submitting Personal Data through our Site or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
2. A Note About Children. We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Data such parent should contact us at privacy@neulion.com. If we become aware of Personal Data belonging to a child under 13, we will take reasonable steps to delete such Personal Data from our files.
<br><br>
3. A Note to Users Outside of the United States. Your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.
<br><br>
4. Types of Data We Collect. "Personal Data" means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other nonpublic information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. "Anonymous Data" means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
<br><br>

<br><br>
(x) If you purchase and watch protected DivX content using the DivX Player, which is a downloadable software product owned by subsidiary DivX, LLC,  you will have to create an Account and the DivX Player application will track and log requests to view the protected content in order for us to enforce the usage rights set by the content owner.
