	<li>
	  <p><strong>Information Collection and   Use<br>
	    </strong>Safari Books Online is the sole owner of   the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this   information to others except as disclosed in this statement. </p>
	  <p>Safari   Books Online collects information from our users at several different points on   our website. We consider all of the information we collect from you to be   Personal Identifying Information, including your email address, name, password,   mailing address, job information, skill information, demographic information,   and credit card information. Safari Books Online uses this information to serve   your needs as well as our own legitimate business purposes. Our company may use   your Personal Identifying Information to help us improve our Web site, or for   our company's marketing and promotional purposes (for example, email   announcements of new books in the service). </p>
	  <p>All   Personal Identifying Information will be treated confidentially within our   company. While our policy is not to share this information with third parties,   we may share this information with affiliates of Safari Books Online, LLC, as   well as with our business partners (for example, reseller sites that offer the   Safari electronic reference library services). We may also release personal   information when we believe that release is appropriate to comply with the law,   or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Safari Books Online, our users,   or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and   organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. </p>
    <p>When you   voluntarily post Personal Identifying Information to a public area of this Web   site (for example, public notes), that information may be collected and used by   others. Since this information is public, we can't prevent other users from   collecting it. </p></li>
	<li>
	  <p><strong>Special Notice to   Parents<br>
	    </strong>While we have no intention of seeking   Personally Identifiable Information about minors who visit this Web site, the   same privacy policies will apply to that information. In addition, when we can   identify a user as a minor, the Personally Identifiable Information will not be   used for further marketing and promotion. We encourage you to ask your children   to seek your permission before they provide information about themselves or   their family members over the Internet. </p>
  </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Special Notice to   Kids<br>
        </strong>Ask your parent or guardian for   permission before you send any personal information over the Internet. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Registration<br>
        </strong>To use this   website, either as a trial user or a subscriber, you must first complete the   registration form. During registration, you're required to give your email. This   email address is used to contact you about the services on our site in which   you've expressed interest.

    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Ordering<br>
        </strong>When you place an   order, we request information from you on our order form. You must provide   contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information   (like credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for   billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an   order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Cookies<br>
        </strong>Safari Books Online uses "cookies" to   improve the quality of your visit to the Safari site by providing you with   personalized information and features. Cookies are a software technology that   enables our systems to recognize your computer and collect non-personal   information about you. This type of information includes: type of browser used   to access the Internet (i.e. Netscape 6.2, Internet Explorer 4.0), type of   operating system (i.e. Windows 95, Macintosh), and the domain of your Internet   service provider. Cookies are anonymous; Safari Books Online does not know the   name, email address, phone number, or home address of anyone who visits our   site. Safari does not sell or rent any information that we gather through the   use of cookies. <br>
        <br>
        You can   set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies or to block cookies. If   you block cookies, you will not be able to use certain site features or   functions. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Log Files<br>
        </strong>We use IP addresses   from our log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track users'   movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP   addresses are not linked to Personally Identifiable Information. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Sharing<br>
        </strong>We   sometimes share aggregated demographic information with our partners and   resellers. This is not linked to any information that can identify an individual   person. </p>
      <p>We use an   outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services.   This company does not retain, share, store or use Personally Identifiable   Information for any secondary purposes. </p>
      <p>When we   partner with another party to provide specific services (for example, ship book   purchases), we will share names or other contact information that is necessary   for the third party to provide these services. </p>
      <p>These   parties are not allowed to use Personally Identifiable Information except for   the purpose of providing these services. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Links<br>
        </strong>Safari Books   Online contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy   practices of other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site,   and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects   Personally Identifiable Information. This privacy statement applies solely to   information collected by Safari Books Online. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Surveys &amp;   Contests<br>
        </strong>From time to time, we request information   from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests   is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to   disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information   (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip   code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and   award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or   improving this site. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Security<br>
        </strong>Safari Books Online takes every   commercially reasonable precaution under current industry standards to protect   user information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your   information is protected both online and off-line using those standards. </p>
      <p>When our registration/order form asks you   to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social   security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best   encryption software in the industry—SSL. While on a secure page, such as our   order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers (e.g. Netscape Navigator   or Microsoft Internet Explorer) becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked (or open)   when you are just surfing. </p>
      <p>While we use   SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in   our power to protect user information off-line. All user information, not just   the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only   employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a   billing clerk or customer service representative) are granted access to   Personally Identifiable Information. Furthermore, all employees are kept   up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that we   store Personally Identifiable Information on are kept in a secure environment,   behind a locked cage. </p>
      <p>If you   have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a title="blocked::mailto:techsupport@safaribooksonline.com" href="mailto:techsupport@safaribooksonline.com">techsupport@safaribooksonline.com</a>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Special   Offers<br>
        </strong>Occasionally, Safari may send registered   users information on products, services, and special deals via email. As a paid   subscriber you may choose to be removed from this email list. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Correction/Updating Personal   Information<br>
        </strong>To change your Safari account information   (address, credit card, etc.), Login on to your Safari account.Click the   "Account" link in the upper right hand corner and follow the instructions for   updating your account information, If you have questions or need help with   making changes, e-mail <a title="blocked::mailto:customer-service@safaribooksonline.com" href="mailto:customer-service@safaribooksonline.com">customer-service@safaribooksonline.com</a>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Choice/Opt-Out<br>
        </strong>You are   always notified when your information is being collected by any outside parties,   so that you can make an informed choice as to whether you should proceed with   services that require an outside party, or not. </p>
      <p>We will send   you email messages when we need to tell you about things that effect your   subscription or service. We also occasionally send subscribers email   announcements of special offers or new services. You can choose to opt-out of   receiving such marketing messages by clicking "unsubscribe" at the bottom of any   such e-mail message. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Notification of   Changes<br>
        </strong>If we change our Privacy Policy, we will   post those changes on www.safaribooksonline.com/PRIVACY. If we decide to use   Personally Identifiable Information in a manner different from that stated at   the time it was collected, we will notify users via email. Users will be able to   opt out of any new use of their personal information. We will use information in   accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. </p>
