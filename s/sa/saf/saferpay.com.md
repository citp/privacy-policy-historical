This document was last updated January 1, 2003.

  
At Telekurs Card Solutions (saferpay.com), we are committed to protecting your privacy and to developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience. You can travel through most of our site without giving us any information about yourself, but we do sometimes need information to provide the services that you request, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use in those situations. Please read the complete saferpay.com privacy statement.

## Collecting your Personal Information

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are asked to register before entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access premium site, or when purchasing and registering saferpay products.

For example, if you choose to make a purchase in the Shop area of the Web site, we will request personal information such as: name, address, telephone number, credit card number and shipping information.

When you buy and install saferpay products, we will create a personal profile for you. We keep this information on file with any information you've already given us on previous visits to our Web site. This is considered your personal profile.

If you ever want to review or update your profile, you will find most of the information in your personal website, such as mysaferpay.
