**We DO NOT store details of, or monitor, the website you connect to or any of the data sent over our network when using our VPN service.**

### 3\. Non-Personal Information Safer Social Ltd. Collects from [www.SaferVPN.com](http://www.safervpn.com/) and How We Use It:

\- Using services, such as Google Analytics, we collect certain aggregated and non-personal information when users visit our Site. Aggregated and non-personal information does not relate to a single, identifiable visitor. It tells us information such as how many users visited our Site and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our Site to our visitors. Through the use of web analytics software, Safer Social Ltd. may use “cookies” to assist the tracking of how users engage our website. A cookie is a piece of data that the web server stores on the browser's PC which the web browser will then send back to the web server on any future requests, to facilitate identification of the user should they visit the website again. While much of the information that we collect from users in this manner is not personally identifiable, it may be associated with personally identifiable information that users voluntarily provide to us through our web site. 

### 4\. How Safer Social Ltd. Securely Stores Data?

\- All information you provide to us is stored on our secured servers. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps commercially and reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

\- Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access. 

\- We keep your personal data only as long as we need it for the purposes for which it was originally collected (or to which you have subsequently consented), for other legitimate purposes (such as regulatory compliance), and as permitted or required by applicable law. 

\- You have chosen a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Site; you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. 

### 5\. Will Safer Social Ltd. Disclose Your Information?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to third parties. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our Site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. 

\- Notwithstanding the above, we may disclose your personal information to third parties: 

  * In the event that Safer SocialLtd. becomes a part of a group of companies, we may disclose your data to any member of such group;
  * In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;
  * If Safer Social Ltd. is, or substantially all of its assets are, acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its users will be one of the transferred assets;
  * If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or our safety, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 



### 6\. Regional Privacy Policies
