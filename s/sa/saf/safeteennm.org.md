Aggregate Information may be collected through the use of a “cookie” or small text file placed on the User’s hard drive by the User’s Internet browser.

It is permanently disabled when the User exits the Website, and information about individual Users is not collected, saved or distributed to others by SAFETEEN Inc. Aggregate Information and other information gathered through voluntary User surveys and forms assists SAFETEEN Inc. to better understand Users’ needs and improve the Website, and to enable SAFETEEN Inc. to demonstrate to vendors and others information about the volume and nature of its Website traffic.
