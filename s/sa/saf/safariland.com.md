###### DATA SECURITY

We restrict access to personal information collected about you at our Website to our employees, our affiliates’ employees, or others who need to know that information to provide services to you or in the course of conducting our normal business operations. While no website can guarantee security, we use commercial reasonable efforts to maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information collected via the Website.

We also advise all Company employees about their responsibility to protect customer data and we provide them with appropriate guidelines for adhering to our Company’s business ethics standards and confidentiality policies.

###### SECURITY OF YOUR CREDIT CARD DATA

Safariland utilizes a third party payment management company (“CyberSource”) in order to process credit card transactions. You can read more about CyberSource at <http://www.cybersource.com/privacy/>. CyberSource utilitzes a process know as “tokenization” in order to securly process credit card transactions when you provide your credit card data to Safariland. Tokenization is the replacement of sensitive data with a unique identifier that cannot be mathematically reversed. Within Safariland’s environment, tokens take the place of sensitive credit card data. The token will retain the last four digits of the card as a means of accurately matching the token to the payment card owner. The remaining numbers are generated using proprietary tokenization algorithms.

• To make a purchase on the Website, the customer will enter their payment card information into the designated payment fields on the order page. These payment fields will be hosted by CyberSource using Secure Acceptance. When you submit your credit card data to Safariland, the data is immediately encrypted and transmitted directly to CyberSource for storing, processing, and token generation. The payment data is not stored or retained by Safariland.   
• The encrypted primary account number (PAN) is decrypted when it enters CyberSource’s Level 1, PCI-compliant data vault, where it is securely stored. The payment data is then passed on to the processing channel (bank) and returned to CyberSource with an accepted or denied result.   
• CyberSource returns the result to Safariland but substitutes the PAN data with a uniquely generated token. The token is stored by Safariland for future transactions. Safariland performs quarterly scans in order to demonstrate compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI-DSS”).

###### COOKIES

The Website may also collect certain technical information about your visit. It can include information, such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the type of operating system you are using, the date and time you accessed the site; the pages that you access while at the site, your manner of connecting to the Internet, the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Website, other information about your geographic location, and the domain name of your Internet service provider.
