## DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED

We hire other companies to provide services on our behalf, such as website hosting, packaging, shipping, professional services, marketing and sales communications and other services. We will only provide those companies the personal data they need to deliver the service. The third parties are required to protect the personal data and to only use the personal data to perform the services for us.

We disclose personal data to our affiliates as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

We may disclose personal data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on £urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our employees or agents, users of our products or services, or members of the public. We will comply with lawful requests for access to personal data from law enforcement authorities.

We reserve the right to transfer your personal data in the event of a transfer of ownership, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, we or the new owner will notify you of the transfer.

## LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING

In connection with our activities outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"), we process personal data with consent except where otherwise permitted or required by law. Your consent may be express or implied, depending on the circumstances and the sensitivity of the personal data in question.

In connection with our commercial activities in the EEA, we rely on one of the following legal grounds (as appropriate) to process personal data:

  1. To enter and perform a contract with you or to perform any steps you require from us before entering into a contract.
  2. To pursue our legitimate business interests in establishing, managing or concluding our business relationship with you.
  3. Where you have specifically consented to us processing your personal data.
  4. To comply with our legal obligations and establish, exercise or defend our legal rights.



## INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA

The Company is headquartered in United States. As described above, we share personal data with affiliates and service providers, who may be located in Europe (including United Kingdom), Canada, Mexico or other countries. As a result, your personal data may be processed and stored in these countries for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We take appropriate steps to ensure that any international transfer of personal data is carried out in compliance with applicable laws. We have intra-company agreements with our affiliates, where applicable, that govern the transfer and processing of personal data. With regard to service providers, to the extent required by applicable law, we rely on EU Standard Contractual Clauses, Privacy Shield certification, other approved codes of conduct or certification mechanisms or binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient, to ensure that the transfer is in accordance with legal requirements.

## DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS AND OPT OUT

The file containing your personal data will be maintained on our servers or those of our service provider. If you wish to request access to, or correction of, your personal data in our custody or control, please contact us as described below. We may need to verify your identity before searching for or providing you with personal data.

Where personal data is processed with consent, you may (subject to contractual and legal restrictions) refuse to provide your consent, or choose to withdraw your consent, to our processing of your personal data. Note that if you refuse to consent, or withdraw your consent, to certain processing of your personal data, we may not be able to provide certain of our services.

You may unsubscribe from our email communications by using the unsubscribe feature in our emails. You may also ask us not to use your personal data for marketing purposes, by contacting us at [webmaster@safariland.com.](mailto:webmaster@safariland.com)

If you are in the EEA you may also have the right, in specified circumstances, to object to our use of your personal data, to request the deletion of your personal data or restrict its use, to request a copy of the information you have provided to us to use for your own purposes, or to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. If you have any questions about these rights, or you would like to exercise any of them, please contact us as described in the Contact Information section below.

## HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA

We hold your personal data only as long as we have a valid legal reason to do so, which includes providing you with the services you have requested, meeting our legal and regulatory obligations, resolving disputes and enforcing our agreements. The length of time for which we keep different types of personal data can vary, depending on why we originally obtained them, the reason we process them and the legal requirements that apply to them.

In general, we keep your personal data for the length of any contractual relationship and, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, after the end of that relationship for as long as necessary to perform purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, to protect us from legal claims and administer our business. When we no longer need to use personal data, we will delete it from our systems and records or take steps to anonymize the data unless we need to keep it longer to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.

When setting our data retention and deletion timescales we take into account a range of factors including applicable regulations and standards relating to taxation, payment processing and complaint handling, the need to prevent or detect crime or other misuse of our services, and audit requirements. To fulfill our requirements, some of your personal data will need to be retained for a period of time after you cease to be a customer. When we no longer need it to fulfil the above requirements, we delete it securely.

## INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN

We are committed to preserving online privacy for all of our website visitors, including children. The Website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect information about children or sell products to children. We will not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, you must ask your parent or guardian to assist you in using www.safariland.com. Furthermore, we may restrict entries to any contests, sweepstakes or promotions to entrants who are at least 18 years of age.

## CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS' PRIVACY RIGHTS

Under California law, California residents may opt-out of our disclosing personal data about them to third parties for their marketing purposes. If you do not want us to disclose information to other companies for their marketing purposes, please contact us by any of the ways described in the "Contact Information" section above. Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to request from a business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information with respect to the types of personal data the business shares with third parties for direct marketing purposes by such third party and the identities of the third parties with whom the business has shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year. To request a copy of such information, please contact us by any of the ways described in the "Contact Information" section below, and we will respond within 30 days as required by law. California law also requires us to disclose how we respond to your web browser, "do not track" signals, or other mechanisms that provide you the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across third-party sites or online services. We are also required to disclose whether other parties may collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different sites when you use the website. For more specific information on Do Not Track and the exercise of consumer choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across third-party sites or online services, please review our [Cookie Policy](http://www.safariland.com/privacy-security/cookie-policy.html).

## DATA SECURITY

We restrict access to personal data collected about you at our Website to our employees, our affiliates' employees, or others who need to know that information to provide services to you or in the course of conducting our normal business operations. While no website can guarantee security, we use commercial reasonable efforts to maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal data collected via the website. We protect our databases with various physical, technical and procedural measures and we restrict access to your information by unauthorized persons. We also advise all Company employees about their responsibility to protect customer data and we provide them with appropriate guidelines for adhering to our Company's business ethics standards and confidentiality policies.

## SECURITY OF YOUR CREDIT CARD DATA

We use a third-party payment management company ("CyberSource") in order to process credit card transactions. You can read more about CyberSource at <http://www.cybersource.com/privacy/>. CyberSource utilizes a process known as "tokenization" in order to securely process credit card transactions when you provide your credit card data to us. Tokenization is the replacement of sensitive data with a unique identifier that cannot be mathematically reversed. Within our environment, tokens take the place of sensitive credit card data. The token will retain the last four digits of the card as a means of accurately matching the token to the payment card owner. The remaining numbers are generated using proprietary tokenization algorithms.

  * To make a purchase on the website, the customer will enter their payment card information into the designated payment fields on the order page. These payment fields will be hosted by CyberSource using Secure Acceptance. When you submit your credit card data to Safariland, the data is immediately encrypted and transmitted directly to CyberSource for storing, processing, and token generation. The payment data is not stored or retained by us.
  * The encrypted primary account number (PAN) is decrypted when it enters CyberSource's Level 1, PCI-compliant data vault, where it is securely stored. The payment data is then passed on to the processing channel (bank) and returned to CyberSource with an accepted or denied result.
  * CyberSource returns the result to us but substitutes the PAN data with a uniquely generated token. The token is stored by Safariland for future transactions. Safariland performs quarterly scans in order to demonstrate compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ("PCI-DSS").
