# Safeco – Consumer Privacy Policy

### Consumer Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 07/01/2004

Safeco and its affiliated companies appreciate the trust you place in us when you ask us to help protect and accumulate your assets. You trust us with your private, personal information when you invest with us or purchase insurance from us. We are committed to protecting your private information. Safeco does not sell information about you to others.

To learn more about how Safeco collects and uses your personal information, please read the following notice.

#### Safeco's sources of information about you

We collect personal information about you from:

  * The information you provide on applications or other forms (such as your name, address and Social Security number)
  * Your transactions with us, our affiliates or others (such as your payment history and claims information)
  * The information we receive from a consumer reporting agency (such as your credit history)
  * Your insurance agent (such as updated information pertaining to your account)



#### Safeco's use of your personal information

We treat your information with respect and concern for your privacy. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law.

For example, we may share any or all of your information with our affiliated companies and independent Safeco representatives and Independent Insurance Agents authorized to sell Safeco products. We may also disclose any or all information we have collected about you to companies that perform services on our behalf and to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.

When we make this type of disclosure it is done to service your Safeco account or policy, or to inform you about Safeco products and services. Before disclosing your information, we require these companies to promise to keep it confidential and use it only for the transaction we request.

We may also disclose any or all information we have collected about you to companies that perform services on our behalf and to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.

#### Independent Safeco Representatives

The Independent Insurance Agents authorized to sell Safeco products are not Safeco employees and not subject to Safeco's Privacy Policy. Because they have a unique business relationship with you, they may have additional personal information about you that Safeco does not have. They may use this information differently than Safeco. Contact your Safeco agent to learn more about their privacy practices.
