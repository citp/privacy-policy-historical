                    <p>
                    
                    We may collect and process the following data about you:
                    <br><b>On registration</b>
                    <br>-	When you register we will collect your email address, password (encrypted) and your IP address will be logged. You may also choose (but you are not obliged) to provide other personal information through our Site such as your name, address, phone number, payment details, etc. 
                    <br>-	We will need your email address and password in order to provide you with access to our Site and to our downloadable VPN software. We will also need your email address to provide you support orwish to receive email updates, newsletters etc. Your IP address is logged by us so that we can prevent any spam, fraud or abuse of our Site and our services. 
                    <br>-	We use this data to provide our services to you, prevention of fraud and abuse andto personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs). 
                    Payments
                    <br>-	If you opt to pay for use of our services, we will direct you to make payment through a third party payment processor. We currently use the following third party payment providers: PayPalhttp://www.paypal.comand Google Checkout http://wallet.google.com. 
                    <br>-	The third party site will provide us with, and we will then store, the date on which you made the payment and the date that your account will expire, along with a generic number (your "Order ID Number") and in case you selected credit card payment option we will store the last four digits of your credit card number. We do not store your name, home address (unless you entered them)but this data may be stored by the third party payment provider handling the transaction and may be accessible by us.
                    <br>-	We store this information as it enables us to know when your account will expire and to prevent and detect fraud. We need your Order ID Number so that we can link your order to your account.
                    <br>-	We are not responsible for any third party payment provider handling your transaction and you should refer to the third party payment provider's privacy policy to see how they use your data.
