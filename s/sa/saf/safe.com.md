## Privacy Policy

## Logs

When you visit the Safe Software Web site, our site host makes a record of your visit and logs the following anonymous information for statistical purposes – the user's server address, the user's top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .ca, .uk etc), the date and time of visit to the site, the pages accessed and documents downloaded, search engine if applicable, and the type of browser used. The statistical information we gather will be used to help us improve the Web site's accessibility and navigability. No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the Internet Service Provider's logs.

## Links

Safe Software web site contains links to other sites. Safe Software is not responsible for the content and the privacy practices of other web sites and encourages you to examine each site's privacy policy and make your own decisions regarding the accuracy, reliability and correctness of material and information found.

## E-Mail

We will record your e-mail address only if you send us a message. It will be used for replying to you directly only if you wish to have Safe Software staff reply to your message. It will be added to Safe Software’s mailing list only if you request inclusion. We will not use your e-mail address for any other purpose, and will not disclose it to any third party without your consent.

## Software Usage Reporting

Upon installation of FME Suite, under the Usage Reporting dialog box, you were prompted to make a selection on whether or not you would allow us to report usage statistics. If you selected "Yes, report usage" we will collect information about your version of Windows (i.e. 95, 98, XP) and how you use our software. The information collection process is completely anonymous, and your results will be automatically combined with the results gleaned from other users. The resulting statistics will help us identify trends and usage patterns (for example, what formats and processing facilities are utilized more than others), which in turn will help us focus our development efforts for future versions of FME Suite. We will not collect your name, address or any other personally identifiable information.

We do not use any external identifiers to uniquely identify our contacts. Safe Software allows anonymous interaction wherever it is practical and does not transfer personal information internationally. We do not collect any potentially sensitive information on any person.
