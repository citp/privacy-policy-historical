Some of our email messages contain click-through URLs linked to specific content on our website.

We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications. If you prefer not to be tracked, simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.

#### Clear GIFs

Clear GIFs (a.k.a. beacons or tags) are tiny graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. We may use Clear GIFs to tell us what parts of a website you have visited, to measure the effectiveness of searches you perform on our website, or to determine if an email message has been opened. We may use this information to tailor our communications to meet your preferences.

#### Software Usage Reporting

Upon installation of a licensed copy of software, we may collect IP address and Non-Personal Information. This information will be automatically combined with results gleaned from other users. The resulting statistics will help us identify trends and usage patterns (for example, what formats and processing facilities are used more than others), which in turn will help us focus our development efforts for future versions of software. If you are using the full installer from our main downloads page then you may opt-out of software usage reporting at the time of installation or you can turn off software usage reporting by going to the "Tools" drop-down menu in FME Workbench and selecting "FME Options". Under "Translation" you can select or deselect the "Track Usage Statistics" option. If you are using a trial or evaluation license and the corresponding installer, then there is no option to disable software usage reporting.

Upon installation of an evaluation copy of software, you will be provided with an evaluation code which we can use to determine if the evaluation license has been activated. Your evaluation code may be combined with contact information you submitted during your request and your IP address. We use this information to troubleshoot problem areas, provide support, and contact you for evaluation feedback.
