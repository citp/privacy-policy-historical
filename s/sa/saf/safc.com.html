<p>Site tracking<br>
When visiting our website, we would like to use "cookies" and other tracking technologies which record information and data automatically.</p>
<p>"Cookies" are small text files stored on your "browser" on your computer's hard drive, which collect basic information, but not personally identifying information, that a website can use to recognize repeat site visits. Cookies send information stored on them back to our webserver when you access our website.</p>
<p>Cookies enable SAFC to provide features such as remembering your address, so that you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the website. Cookies do not attach to your system or damage your files.</p>
<p>Cookies can be deleted from your hard drive if you wish. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. You can usually change your browser so that it will not accept cookies. If you do this, you will still be able to browse around the site and use most of the features on the website but the functions that allow you to add items to your trolley, set up a new account or access an existing account will not be available. Alternatively, you can adjust your browser to tell you when a website tries to put a cookie on your computer. How you adjust your browser to stop it accepting cookies or to notify you of them, will depend on the type of internet browser programme which your computer uses.</p>
<p>If your computer uses Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, you will need to follow these instructions at this link <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> (SAFC is not responsible for the content of external websites. This link will open a new window.)</p>
<p>Go to the heading "Manage Cookies". Click onto the option you prefer, either stopping cookies being installed or notifying you of them. From the list provided, click onto the programme which your computer uses. If this is not shown on the list, click on the "help" heading on the bar at the top of this page, search for information on "cookies" - an explanation of how to delete cookies will appear, then follow those instructions.</p>
<p>If we cannot use such technology it is possible that certain functionality or 'personalised' services of this site might be affected and you might not be able to access certain Webpages. This information does not identify you personally.</p>
<p>We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit:-</p>
<p>• the internet domain and IP address from where you access our Website;<br>
• the type of browser software and operating system used to access our Website;<br>
• the date and time you access our Website;<br>
• the pages you enter, visit and exit our Website from; and<br>
• if you linked to our Website from another Website, the address of that Website.</p>
<p>We use this information to help us identify click stream patterns, to compile aggregate data in order to observe behaviour and to improve our Website, to leam about the number of visitors to our Website, the types of technology our visitors use, to target the advertising and to assess the general effectiveness of such advertising.</p>
<p>We only use this information to ensure that our Webpages stay compatible with a selection of browsers and systems and thereby ensure that the pages appeal to a wide audience.</p>
<p>Currently our Webpages are optimised for the following Internet browsers: Internet Explorer 5.0 +, Netscape 6.0 +, Firefox, Safari, Netscape and Firefox on MACs.</p>
<p>We do not use cookies to collect or store personal information such as your name or email address.</p>
<p>Third party advertising cookies<br>
Some of the advertisements you see on this site are generated by third parties. Some of these third parties generate their own "anonymous cookies", for the same reasons we do: to track how many unique users have seen a particular ad, and how many times they have seen it.</p>
<p>These third party cookies cannot be used to identify an individual user, but only for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. Additionally, the companies that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy policies but we don't have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all (although we may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users).</p>
<p>In using this website, and by submitting your information, you consent to the collection, storage and use of your personal information by us as set out in this Policy.</p>
<p>If you do not agree, please leave this website now.</p>
<p>You may save this Privacy Policy onto your computer for future reference.</p>
<p>Should you wish to obtain a copy of the personal data that we hold on you, please send an e-mail to the following address: <a href="mailto:webmaster@safc.com">webmaster@safc.com</a>.</p>
<p>As soon as we are satisfied as to your identity, we will send to you, within 40 days, a copy of all the data that we hold concerning you.<br>
Any queries or comments about this privacy policy should be forwarded by email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@safc.com">webmaster@safc.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a complaint concerning any breach of this privacy policy, contact us by email at <a href="mailto:webmaster@safc.com">webmaster@safc.com</a>. When we receive the complaint, we will review it and ensure that we are in compliance with our privacy policy and all applicable laws. We will contact you within 40 days of receiving your complaint to inform you of the results of your complaint.</p>
<p>If we decide to change our Privacy Policy we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and in what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
