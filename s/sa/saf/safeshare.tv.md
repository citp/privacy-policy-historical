## Children's Privacy

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

We market to and collect information from children under 13.

Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?

We also allow third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under 13.

**In order to remove your child's information please contact the following personnel:**

**We adhere to the following COPPA tenants:**

  * We will not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity.
  * Parents can review their child's personal information, direct us to delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child's information.
  * Parents can agree to the collection and use of their child's information, but still not allow disclosure to third-parties unless that's part of the service.
  * Parents can review, delete, manage or refuse with whom their child's information is shared through contacting our support staff.
  * We will notify parents directly before collecting PII from their kids. This includes what specific information you will want to collect and how it might be disclosed, a link to your online privacy policy, and how the parents can give their consent. Also, if the parent doesn't consent within a reasonable time, you will delete the parent's and child's online contact info from your records.
  * Parents can give consent by sign a consent form and send it back to us via electronic scan and contacting us directly.
