Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") means information that can be directly associated with you (such as your name, email address, telephone number or billing information), or information about activities directly linked to you (such as subscriptions that you have licensed or purchased). We collect PII in the following ways:

When you contact or communicate with Safari, we may gather information such as your name, physical address, email address and phone number. When you participate in a promotional offer (such as a trial subscription) and/or purchase products or services, we may gather information regarding the offer that you participate in, and any products or services that you purchase, as well as financial information such as your credit card number.
