### 1\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") means information that can be directly associated with you (such as your name, email address, telephone number or billing information), or information about activities directly linked to you (such as subscriptions that you have licensed or purchased). We collect PII in the following ways:

#### 1.1 INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE TO US DIRECTLY:

When you contact or communicate with Safari, we may gather information such as your name, physical address, email address and phone number.

When you participate in a promotional offer (such as a trial subscription) and/or purchase products or services, we may gather information regarding the offer that you participate in, and any products or services that you purchase, as well as financial information such as your credit card number. When you register for an online account, subscribe to a newsletter, participate in communities or an event, program, class or promotion, or click on a URL, we may gather user preferences, product interests, industry focus, community choices and other customer profile information.

#### 1.2 INFORMATION WE COLLECT THROUGH TECHNOLOGY RELATED TO OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES:

Certain products and services that you acquire from us may connect and transmit telemetry and system/product data to us or our authorized agents. This data may include, but is not limited to, system model, operating system, host ID and IP address.

We use this information to manage and administer our products and services, and as the basis for advising you of the availability of updates and new versions, testing and monitoring services that we provide, enhancing our products and services, and improving and targeting our communications with you.

#### 1.3 INFORMATION WE COLLECT THROUGH ONLINE TECHNOLOGY:

We use cookies for authentication, to remember users’ settings, and to improve user experience and the overall quality of our service. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited. 

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by us and our affiliates, and other companies with whom we do business, such as technology service providers, analytics providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports from these companies based on the use of these technologies by these companies, and the reports may be based on the analysis of individual and/or aggregated usage.

**Analytics / Log Files** \- As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. 

We engage a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. That third party company may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) or if located in the European Union, click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads; you will continue to receive generic ads. 

We use Local Storage (LS) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LS. 

Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook and Twitter sign on buttons. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets may be hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites. Your interactions with these third-party features are governed by the privacy policy of the companies providing the features.

You can log in to our community forum using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity, provide you the option to share certain personal information (such as your name and email address) with us, and pre-populate our community forum sign- up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our community forum to your profile page to share with others within your network.

#### 1.4 INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES:

From time-to-time we may receive information from other sources, such as commercial contact lists or companies that we acquire, and we may combine that information with information previously collected. If you give us PII on behalf of someone else (or someone else gives us PII on your behalf), we require that the person providing the PII to us must have consent to do so from the person whose information is provided. To request the removal of your PII, whether it was provided by you, by a friend, or by a third party marketing company, please see the "Access and Accuracy" section below.

Some Safari events, websites or services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with a third party. When you provide PII in relation to them, both Safari and the third party(ies) may receive the information collected and use the information according to each company's privacy policy and agreement with you. We recommend reading the privacy statement of our co-branding partners as well, if you are accessing our services through a co-branded offering.

### 2\. HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

  * Processing and fulfilling orders
  * Creating and monitoring accounts
  * Market research projects

### 6\. SECURITY

Safari uses administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of PII against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

It is important to us to maintain the accuracy of your contact information. We provide individuals with reasonable access to their PII in order to have it corrected, amended or deleted where it is inaccurate or inappropriate for the specified purposes of processing.

### 11\. FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS: YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS AND DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURE

Safari’s policy is to share your personal information only if you have given us your consent, for instance, by your agreeing to this Policy through your use of our sites. After obtaining such consent, Safari may in accordance with this policy from time to time provide its business partners with contact details for direct marketing purposes of relevant services, products, and programs.

You can email us at [marketing@safaribooksonline.com](mailto:marketing@safaribooksonline.com).

At this time our websites do not respond to web browser “do not track” signals or comparable signals or mechanisms. There is much current discussion in the industry, among government agencies, lawmakers, and the public regarding alternative “do not track” response standards. We will continue to monitor “do not track” developments, with the expectation of modifying our policy in the future as these issues are resolved.
