6.         Delivery:

  
Inside Delivery: Typically inside delivery is not available on any order. If inside delivery is required, there will be an additional fee. The amount of this fee varies by location and availability. Ask your sales representative for more information.

Business Delivery is a free charge to a location that has a loading dock or a forklift on premises. If the customer does not have this accessibility they will be charged $30.00 for residential delivery. If they need a liftgate to unload the product they will also be charged $75.00 on top of the Residential delivery.

Residential Delivery is a $30.00 fee that simply brings the freight truck to a delivery location that does not have a loading dock, or forklift on site. This does not include a liftgate service. Residential Delivery cannot be guaranteed under any circumstances, and is a non-refundable fee.

Liftgate: This is a $75.00 fee for a lift, which will lower the unit to the ground for the customer. Residential Delivery also should be paid if a liftgate is included in the purchase. Liftgate Service cannot be guaranteed under any circumstances, and is a non-refundable fee.

7.         Damage during Shipment:  The items we sell pass a thorough manufacturer’s inspection prior to shipping and are insured for damage during shipment.  You are responsible for the product once it is in transit, including any damage or loss that may occur during shipment.  If you receive a damaged product, please contact the shipper (typically Fed Ex, DHL, or UPS) and file a damage claim with the shipper.  The insurance is designed to provide you with the funds to repair the damage or loss.  The amount the item is insured for is approximately the wholesale cost of the item minus shipping. We cannot take responsibility for damage or loss during shipment. If you choose to refuse your shipment, the total claim process can take 4 to 12 months; on occasion the claim can even exceed this timeframe. We do not suggest refusal of a shipment under any circumstances.

8.         Order Cancellation Policy:  Typically orders cannot be cancelled. Any cancellation to an order after the original sale date will automatically incur 30% restocking/cancellation fee plus any shipping charges incurred. Please call ahead of time before canceling. If your order has been sent, you will be charged all of the freight costs. 

9.         Return Policy:  We do not accept returns, exchanges or grant refunds under any circumstances, except as specified below regarding manufacturer’s defects. 

10.        Manufacturer’s Defects/Warranty:  Although we do not accept returns or grant refunds, we will request the product manufacturer to ship replacement parts for confirmed manufacturer’s defects in an item you purchase from us.  The manufacturers of the products we sell generally warrant the products to be free of material defects in workmanship for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of purchase.  Although under warranty the parts will be free of charge however; the cost of shipping must be paid for by the customer in order to ship out the part.  If a part is lost during shipping you have the choice to file a shipping claim and to order the part from Great Sports Inc. at your cost.  Great Sports Inc.  makes no representation concerning any manufacturer’s warranty.
