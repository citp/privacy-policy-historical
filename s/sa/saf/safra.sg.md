## What Personal Information About Members Does SAFRA Gather? 

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at SAFRA. Here are the types of information we gather. 

Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future features for you, improving our services, and communicating with you.   
Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses SAFRA. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at SAFRA if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.   
E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from SAFRA if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our membership list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please click here to unsubscribe. 

## What About Cookies? 

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as a global login for SAFRA’s website and its Online Services.   
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of SAFRA's features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

## Does SAFRA Share the Information It Receives?

Information about our members is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. 

Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We work closely with our affiliated businesses. In some cases, these businesses operate stores at SAFRA or sell offerings to you at SAFRA. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses.   
Third-Party Service Providers (if applicable): We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.   
Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of SAFRA customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please click here to unsubscribe.   
Protection of SAFRA and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Disclaimer and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of SAFRA, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.   
With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.   
How Secure Is Information About Me? 

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.   
We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.   
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.   
Which Information Can I Access? 

SAFRA gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with SAFRA for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. 

What Choices Do I Have? 

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such SAFRA features as Your Profile, Online Booking, etc.   
You can add or update certain information on pages such as those listed in the "Which Information Can I Access?" section above. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.   
If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please click here to unsubscribe. (If you do not want to receive Disclaimer and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of SAFRA, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)   
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.   
The Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online privacy on its own Web site, Site Seeing on the Internet.   
Are Children Allowed to Use SAFRA? 

(Condition of use subject to SAFRA’s policy on online booking of events). If you are under 18, you may use SAFRA only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 

Disclaimer, Notices, and Revisions 

If you choose to visit SAFRA, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Disclaimer, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the Republic of Singapore. If you have any concern about privacy at SAFRA, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. 

Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Disclaimer will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of member information collected in the past without the consent of affected members. 

## Examples of Information Collected

### Information You Give Us 

You provide most such information when you search, signup for an account, book facilities, events, activities and/or communicate with customer service. For example, you provide information when you search for an event; place an booking through SAFRA; communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, and phone numbers; credit card information; people to whom have been included in bookings, including addresses and phone number, e-mail addresses; content of reviews and e-mails to us; and financial information, including Identity Card Numbers. 

### Automatic Information 

Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; booking history, which we sometimes aggregate with similar information from others through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number; information you viewed or searched for. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.
