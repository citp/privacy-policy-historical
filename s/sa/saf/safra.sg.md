## Privacy Policy ("Policy")

This Policy sets out the manner in which SAFRA collects, uses, manages and protects personal data (as defined below) in compliance with the provisions of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012.

This policy applies to all individuals (as defined below) who provide SAFRA with personal data or whose personal data is otherwise collected, used and/or disclosed by SAFRA in connection with and/or for the purpose of its operations.

This policy supplements but does not supersede or replace any previous consent which an individual may have provided to SAFRA, nor does it affects any rights that SAFRA may have at law in connection with the collection, use and/or disclosure of any individual's personal data. Subject to that, SAFRA will not collect any personal data from an individual unless the individual has voluntarily chosen to provide us with it.

SAFRA may from time to time update this policy to ensure it is consistent with its future developments or business purposes or to accommodate future changes to applicable legal or regulatory requirements. All updates to this policy will be published at [www.safra.sg](http://www.safra.sg/) and appropriate notifications of any material revisions will be issued to the relevant persons. Subject to an individual's rights at law, the prevailing terms of the policy from time to time shall apply. By continuing their relationship with SAFRA after any amendments have been introduced and published, individuals shall be deemed to have accepted the policy as amended.

For the avoidance of doubt, this policy forms part of the terms and conditions, if any, governing an individual's specific relationship with SAFRA ( ** _"Terms and Conditions"_** ) and should be read in conjunction with such terms and conditions. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this policy and terms and conditions, the provisions of the terms and conditions shall prevail to the fullest extent permissible by law.

Depending on the extent to which an Individual withdraws consent to any or all use or disclosure of his or her Personal Data by SAFRA, such withdrawal of consent may result in SAFRA’s inability to provide services to the Individual and may be considered as a termination by the Individual of any agreement between SAFRA and the Individual. SAFRA’s legal rights and remedies are expressly reserved in such event.

In so far as an Individual’s data is being collected by cookies, the Individual may disable the use of cookies on his or her internet browser when accessing SAFRA’s website.
