If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Notice, please do not use our Services or provide us with any personal information. **This section regarding consent does not apply if you are based in the EEA or Switzerland.**

## What Types of Personal Information Do We Collect?

**Information You Actively Submit on our Services** : If you create an account, register for a free trial, order services, or otherwise send us data through our Services, we collect personal information about you and the company or other entity you represent (e.g., your name, organization, address, email address, phone number and fax number). You may also provide information specific to your interaction with our Services, such as payment information to make a purchase. In such instances, you will know what data is collected, because you will actively submit it.

**Information Passively Submitted on our Services** : When you visit our Services, our servers collect information from or about the computer, phone or other device on which you have installed or from which you access our Services. In particular, we collect the following types of information: the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your device to the Internet; browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Services, including date and time; cookie number; Services you viewed; your searches on our Services; and the phone number you used to call us if you call us. During some visits, we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page. Unless you also actively submit personal information to us, any information that is passively submitted typically does not allow us to identify you personally.

We, or third party service providers acting on our behalf, may use cookies, and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons to collect the information described above. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser when you use our Services to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features based on who you are.

  * To advertise our Services on third party websites and other digital media.



You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit or use our Services. You can refuse cookies by turning them off on your browser. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. For specific information on how to do so, please visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>. If you want to access webpages on our Services that require you to sign in, you need to accept a mandatory cookie, which you can delete after you leave our Services. Our Services currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals from browsers.

**Information You Actively Submit in Person or via Email, Mail or Phone** : We may also collect your personal information outside of the Services in various business situations, such as if you speak with our personnel at a trade show or industry event, call us for phone-based customer service, or email or mail our personnel for business purposes. In these circumstances, we may collect and process your contact information (e.g., name, email address, phone number and business address), information about your business and its interactions with us, and any other personal information you actively provide to us. In such instances, you will know what data is collected, because you will actively submit it.

These publicly available sources include public profiles on company and professional networking websites.

We also perform statistical analyses of the users of our Services to improve the content, design and navigation of the Services. In these cases, we use anonymized, aggregate or statistical data that cannot be used to identify you.

## To Whom Do We Disclose Your Personal Information?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share your personal information only as described below and in accordance with applicable law.

**Third-Party Service Providers** : We employ our Affiliated and other unaffiliated companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as to send email, remove repetitive information from customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links (including paid listings and links), process credit card payments, and provide customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

**Affiliates** : We share your personal information with our Affiliates to help fulfil sales, respond appropriately to requests and to improve our and their services and business practices. A list of our operating Affiliates and their addresses is available [here](https://saucelabs.com/contact).

**Business Transfers** : As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries, business units or our entire business. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless the customer consents otherwise) and applicable laws.

**Protection of Sauce Labs and Others** : We disclose account and other personal information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Sauce Labs, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. This does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.

**With Your Consent** : Other than as set out above, we will obtain your consent as required by law before disclosing your personal information to a third party.

## What Security Measures Have We Implemented?

We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input, to protect information you submit via our Services.

We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

## Your Choices

You can choose not to provide personal information to us. However, some features of our Services, such as your profile, require that we collect some personal information about you.

If you do not want to receive marketing emails from us, please adjust your email preference settings by clicking [here](http://info.saucelabs.com/preference-center.html) or click on the “opt-out” link in the communication. Even after you have opted out of receiving marketing emails from us, we may still contact you for transactional or informational purposes. These include, for example, customer service issues or any questions regarding a specific inquiry you made to us.

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its developer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our Services’ essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.
