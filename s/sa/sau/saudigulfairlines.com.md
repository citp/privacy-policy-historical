The types of personal information you provide to us on these pages may include name, address, phone number, e-mail address, user IDs and passwords, billing and transaction information, credit card information, contact preferences, educational and employment background, and job interest data. To personalize our websites, services or communications and improve our products and services, we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, and experiences with our products or services. Providing this additional information is optional.

b)“Non-personal information” is data about usage and service operation that is not associated with a specific personal identity.

We also use cookies and web beacons to help us measure the effectiveness of our web communication and marketing in order to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy.

## Collected information

We've structured the SaudiGulf Airline websites so that, in general, you can visit SaudiGulf Airline on the web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. We make this notice readily available on our home page and at the bottom of every SaudiGulf Airline web page.

There are times when we may collect personal information from you. It is our intent to inform you before we do that and to tell you what we intend to do with the information. Generally, you will have the option not to provide the information, and in the future you will be able to "opt out" of certain uses of the information. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the SaudiGulf Airline websites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers and services.
