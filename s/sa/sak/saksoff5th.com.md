**From Third Party Sources:** We may combine your information with information we collect or receive about you from other online and offline sources, which helps us to customize our services.

**Personalized Site Visits:** We, or our service providers, may use cookies, web beacons/pixel tags, log files, and other technologies to collect information about visitors to our website, use of our online services, and interactions with our emails and online advertisements, such as your browser type and operating system, viewed webpages, links that are clicked, IP address, sites visited before coming to our website, emails we send that you open, forward, or click through to our website. Collecting this information, and linking it with your personal information, helps us to tailor our website and enhance your online shopping experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site, and to help identify site features, promotions, advertisements, and offers that may be of particular interest to you.

**Personalized Third Party Advertisements** : We also may use third party advertisements placed by ad networks to support our site.

Some of these advertisers and ad networks also may use anonymous data, such as demographic data, received from third parties to assist in the delivery of advertisements to you. These advertisers and ad networks use the information described above to provide you relevant advertisements based on your online behavior, search activities on our site and on other third party sites, demographic information and/or relevant to your general location, so that the advertising and offers you see on our site more closely reflect your interests and needs.

Q: | **Is there a Saks credit card?**  
A: | The SaksFirst MasterCard® and the SaksFirst Store Card are issued by Capital One N.A. and are serviced by its affiliates, Capital One. Saks does not collect or process any online applications for these credit card products. Those applications are made directly on the issuer-operated website and are subject to its privacy policy and practices.

Q: | **What about security?**  
A: | Protecting the security of your information is very important to us. When you transmit sensitive personal information (such as credit card information) from your computer to our servers, your information is protected by both a "firewall" (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information within our computer network) and industry standard SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. For our mobile website, we protect your payment card information using encryption technology when you place an order. Once we receive your transmission, we will take reasonable precautions to secure and protect the information on our systems. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be 100% secure and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online. However, we strive to protect your information and privacy.   
Q: | **How does Saks communicate changes to this Policy?**  
A: | Any changes to our Privacy Policy will be noted on the home page of our website with a link to the revised policy. Your continued use of the site following posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept these changes. If we change the policy in any material way, we will provide appropriate notice to you.   
Q: | **What about other websites?**  
A: | Our website may include links to third-party websites that are not affiliated with Saks. These websites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data or solicit your information. The privacy policies of these other websites may be very different from our policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other websites and cannot guarantee the security of any personal information provided to or collected by such third party sites.   
Q: | **Whom do I contact if I have additional questions or concerns about this policy?**  
A: | If you have any questions or concerns about this policy or our privacy practices, please contact Customer Service by Email, or telephone.   
Q: | **What are California Privacy Rights?**  
A: | If you are a California resident and would like a copy of our notice describing what categories of personal information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for their direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of the third parties and affiliates that received your information in the past year, please submit a written request to the following address specifying that you want a copy of Saks' "California Privacy Rights" notice: Saks Direct, Inc., P.O. Box 10327, Jackson, MS 39289, attn: California Privacy. Please allow up to 30 days for us to process your request. You may submit such a request once per year.   
Q: | **Why is my billing address required for online purchases?**
