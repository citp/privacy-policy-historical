SaltyMilk.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.

This privacy policy covers how we treat personal information that we collect and receive.

Salty Milk only collects personal information from a user when the user chooses to give it to us by registering with the site or entering a contest. From time to time Salty Milk will use email addresses to inform registered users of new content, contests, news and other information selected by our editors.  Salty Milk will also use email addresses from time to time to deliver email messages from our partners, advertisers and sponsors. In such event the email will disclose that the recipient is receiving the email from SaltyMilk.com because the recipient is a registered user.

Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by selecting Unsubscribe at the bottom of a message received.

Salty Milk will not sell or disclose to any third party your name, address, email address or other personal information that specifically identifies you, unless you specifically provide your informed consent, except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws or a court order. SaltyMilk.com will allow access to database information to third parties providing technical services, but only to the extent necessary to provide those services.
