**Salon.com Privacy Policy**

Salon.com respects your right to the privacy of the personal information you provide us on our Web sites. To that end, unless you designate otherwise or we state otherwise in this policy or at the time information is collected, any personal information you provide to Salon.com will be known only to two parties: you and Salon.com. The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our sites and their features. Personal information includes your name, street and e-mail addresses, billing information, click-through activity and any other personal information you may provide here. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.

**Traffic data**

Each time a visitor comes to a Salon.com Web site, our servers -- like most on the Web -- collect some basic technical information, including, for example, the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from aol.com or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to a Salon.com Web site) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform).

We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Salon.com sites, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but we will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data without your permission. When we do present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you. 

**Use of Salon.com cookies**

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies in a limited way to help deliver advertisements, to identify unique browsers that visit us and to track usage throughout our site. We also use cookies on our Salon Shopping site to make the ordering process more convenient for users.

Other companies which place advertising on our site also have the ability to assign their cookies to you in a process that Salon.com does not control. However, cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines, so these advertisers will not know who you are. 

**Salon Membership**

Salon.com collects personal information from visitors who register with our Salon Membership program, including first and last names, e-mail address, street address and phone numbers. Salon members who have indicated their willingness to accept occasional e-mail from us may receive such e-mail with news about Salon, special offers and benefits for participants in this membership program.

Salon.com is an advertising and e-commerce supported business. The availability of Salon.com depends primarily on its perceived value among advertisers and their willingness to pay for opportunities to reach users of this product. It is this support that allows Salon.com to be distributed free to you.

As such, Salon.com does allow select advertisers to mail promotions to those registrants and newsletter recipients who have given us their permission to do so. All promotions are pre-approved by Salon.com and all mailings are conducted by a reputable third-party mail house to ensure that the names are not misused or used more than once. Neither we nor our third-party agent will ever make this personally identifiable information available to advertisers or partners. You are given the option when registering to receive or not receive promotions from our partners. You may change this designation at any time by logging in to our [registration page](http://bf.salon.com/salon/salon_pref.epl).

**E-mail newsletters**

Salon.com sends a variety of e-mail newsletters to registrants in the Salon.com Membership program who have requested them. The URLs (Web links) in these newsletters contain unique codes that allow Salon.com to gauge the effectiveness of the newsletters and determine how they are being used. This information is valuable to us in the aggregate, but Salon.com makes no use of it to track any individual user's clicks. 

**Letters to the editor**

Salon asks senders of letters to the editor to include a phone number so we can make an effort to verify their identity should we need to in connection with publication of a letter. We do not retain this information for any other purpose, nor do we sell, trade or otherwise disclose it to third parties.

**"E-mail to a friend" feature**

Salon.com offers an "e-mail a friend about this story" feature, allowing site visitors to send e-mail to friends to inform them about an article they might be interested in reading. In order for this feature to function, we ask for e-mail addresses for the recipient (so we know who to mail the message to) and from the sender (so we can tell the recipient who sent the e-mail). We do not store or save these addresses and you will not receive e-mail or other communications from Salon or its partners as a result of having used this feature.

"E-mail a friend about this story" is a mail service that individual visitors to Salon.com make use of to send individual e-mails. While this tool cannot be used to send mass "spam" mailings, Salon.com has no control over how our visitors use it, and any e-mail sent through it originates with, and is the responsibility of, the sender, not Salon.com. 

**Table Talk**

Salon.com visitors who register for our Table Talk community area provide us with a name, password and a working e-mail address. We use this information to set up your account. We do not sell or redistribute the Table Talk membership list and will not send you e-mail at the address you provide, except for infrequent announcements relating to Table Talk or as needed to resolve issues that may arise with your Table Talk account. The e-mail address you register with Salon.com will be posted in Table Talk if and when you post comments there, but you are free at any time to substitute an alternate e-mail address if you wish to keep the one you initially registered private. Participants in Table Talk are expected to comply with the rules governing the area, but we cannot control third parties' use of information you may choose to provide in such a public forum. For more information see the Table Talk [registration page.](http://tabletalk.salon.com/webx?18@@)

**Promotion**

From time to time, Salon.com may sponsor sweepstakes, contests or other events which require the collection, processing and storage of individual contact and demographic information (e.g., your age and state of residence) to be used for the event. Salon may also co-sponsor these events along with other companies, in which case the user's individual contact and demographic information is likely to be shared with other participating sponsors, who may use this information as they wish. A registrant's personal contact and demographic information will not be released to any third-party organization other than named sponsors without the user's consent, and Salon.com will request that such named sponsors uphold the privacy of the registrants' information by not distributing or sharing such information with any other businesses or organizations.

**Surveys**

Salon.com will from time to time conduct voluntary surveys of visitors to the site to obtain aggregate demographic information about them. Such information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with advertisers and other third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals.

**Our commitment to children's privacy**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is important to us. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information at our Web sites from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Web site is structured to attract anyone under 13.

**Other disclosure of personal information**

Salon.com will not otherwise use or disclose your personal information without your consent except (i) as described in this privacy policy, or (ii) as required by law, court order or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority. This policy does not protect information you post to any on-line bulletin board, chat room, newsgroup or other public forum within our Web sites.

**Unsubscribe and data removal policies**

If you would like to unsubscribe from a Salon.com newsletter, please log in to the Membership [Registration](http://bf.salon.com/salon/salon_pref.epl) page and follow the instructions there. Most Salon.com pages have a link to this Registration page in the upper left hand corner. 

If you would like to remove your name and e-mail address from our Table Talk registration database, you can send an e-mail requesting removal to tabletalk@salon.com.

**Other sites**

Salon.com contains many links to other sites on the Web. We cannot control and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other Web sites.

**Who can I ask if I have any additional questions?**

If you have any further questions or concerns about Salon's privacy policies and use of personal information, please send them to [privacy@salon.com.](mailto:privacy@salon.com)
