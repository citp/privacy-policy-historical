**Collection of Information**  
Infogroup Inc. does not collect personally identifiable information about visitors except when  
visitors specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis. For example, such personally  
identifiable information may be gathered from the registration process for subscription sites or  
services and in connection with content submissions, community postings (e.g., chat and bulletin  
boards), suggestions, and transactional areas. Such information may be used by Infogroup Inc. for  
the following purposes: contacting a subscriber regarding account status, changes to the  
subscriber agreement, special discounts, promotions, products offered, and other matters relevant  
to the underlying service and/or the information collected.

Infogroup Inc. values opinions and comments from visitors, so we occasionally conduct online  
surveys. These surveys are entirely optional for all visitors. Most frequently, the information is  
aggregated and used to make improvements to Infogroup Inc. websites and to develop appealing  
content, features and promotions for visitors. Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise  
stated in the survey. Infogroup Inc. reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of visitors’  
behavior and characteristics. In order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site  
and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of visitors that have been  
exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners. Infogroup Inc. will provide only aggregated data  
from these analyses to third parties. Also, visitors should be aware that Infogroup Inc. may  
sometimes permit third parties to offer subscription and/or registration-based services through an  
Infogroup Inc. website.

Infogroup Inc. is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties and visitors should  
check the applicable privacy policy of such party when providing personally identifiable information.  
Visitors should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information  
(e.g., user name, email address) on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas of Infogroup Inc. sites,  
that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in the visitor's communication,  
can be collected, correlated and used by third parties. This information may result in unsolicited  
messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of  
Infogroup Inc.

**Cookies, etc.**  
Visitors also should be aware that non-personal information (for example, domain names or email  
and IP addresses) and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of Info-  
group Inc.'s Internet servers or at Infogroup Inc.'s discretion through the use of "cookies." Cookies  
are small text files a website can use to recognize repeat visitors, facilitate a visitor's ongoing  
access to and use of the site, track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow  
content improvements and targeted advertising. Cookies are not programs that come onto a visi-  
tor's system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the visitor  
that has no meaning outside the assigning site. Visitors to Infogroup Inc. websites should be aware  
that Infogroup Inc. cannot control the use of cookies, or the non-personal information collected  
through the cookies by advertisers or third parties hosting data for Infogroup Inc. If a visitor does  
not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most  
browsers that allows the visitor to deny or accept the cookie feature. However, visitors should note  
that cookies may be necessary to provide them with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of  
information) available on the Infogroup Inc. websites.

Upon a visitor's request, Infogroup Inc. will:

  * Allow any visitor to "opt out" of further promotional contacts;
  * Use reasonable efforts to allow visitors to update/correct personal information previously  
submitted which he/she states is erroneous to the extent such activities will not compromise  
privacy or security interests; and
  * Initiate reasonable efforts to functionally delete the visitor and his/her personal information from  
its database. Visitors should be aware that it might be impossible to completely delete erroneous  
information or a visitor's personal information without some residual information remaining in its  
database because of backups and records of deletions.



**Security**  
Infogroup Inc. is responsible for the security of personal information provided by visitors. Strict  
measures will be taken to ensure against unauthorized access, alteration, or dissemination of  
personal information.
