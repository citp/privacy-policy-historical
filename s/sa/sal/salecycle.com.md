# SaleCycle Privacy Policy

SaleCycle is committed to protecting the privacy of our clients and their customers and the security of any information given to us in order for us to recover abandoned shopping baskets on behalf of our clients.

**Our Data Protection Policy**

We collect personal information on customers provided to us by the client website as the customer progresses through the client’s checkout process.  The collection and use of this information is in accordance with [The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 Regulation 22 Paragraph (3)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/2426/regulation/22/made).

Any personal information held or processed will be kept up-to-date and will be destroyed as soon as the reason for its collection or processing has lapsed. No personal data about customers will be passed to any third party, except to the initiating client and its agents as required to facilitate the sending of recovery emails through the client’s Email Service Providers.

Your privacy and confidence will be respected at all times.

**What Information is collected about you and how is it used?**

When you visit the client’s checkout we may collect your name, e-mail and telephone number. This information allows us to ensure that our client sends a relevant and timely recovery email to you.

We do not sell your personal information to anyone. Ever.

We only provide your personal information to the originating client and their Email Service Provider(s).

We do not use your personal details for any purposes other than sending you shopping basket recovery emails and providing reports to our client.

**Third parties**

We only provide your personal information to the client and their Email Service Provider(s).

**Consent**

By visiting a participating client checkout you consent to the information you provide to us being processed for any of the above purposes.

**Cookies**

Cookies are small pieces of information that are sent from your browser to our web server.

On a client’s web site, cookies are used to identify you as the same user that abandoned a shopping basket and was sent a recovery email, and to prevent customers being sent multiple emails. These cookies expire after 90 days.

**Security**

The security of customer transactions is important to us and to prevent any details being seen by unauthorised we ensure that our clients encrypt the information before it is sent to our servers.

**Subject Access Request**

On your written request, we will (within 40 days of such a request being received by us) supply to you details of the personal information which we hold about you. You must explain to us clearly the information you require to be supplied: we are not obliged to supply to you information which is not specifically requested by you. Under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998, we are entitled to charge you £10.00 for the provision of information following our receipt of such a request. Once we have received your written request and payment of the fee, we will respond to your request within 40 days.

You should note that, under certain circumstances, we will not be obliged to disclose the requested information to you, in which case we will explain to you the reasons for our refusal.
