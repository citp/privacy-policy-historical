#### 3\. PURPOSES FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION 

We may process your personal information for the following purposes:

  * to provide you with the information, products and services you have requested and send you marketing and advertising materials;
  * to authenticate your access to our website;
  * for system administration purposes and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes;

#### 4\. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION 

We will only process your personal information where we have a legal basis to do so. The legal basis will depend on the purposes for which we have collected and use your personal information. In almost every case the legal basis will be one of the following: 

  * When the processing is necessary to fulfil a contract that we have in place with you (or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract with you); 
  * Where we have your consent to our use of your personal data;
  * When the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests, to ensure that our services are properly provided and to promote our services; or
  * Where we are subject to a legal obligation and need to use your personal information in order to comply with that obligation.



#### 5\. WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

The personal information that we collect may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (the **“EEA”** ), including countries, which have less strict, or no data protection laws, when compared to those in Europe. 

Whenever we transfer your information as described in the paragraph above, we will take steps which are reasonably necessary to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to protect your personal information and to make sure it is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice. In these cases, we rely on approved data transfer mechanisms (such as the EU “Standard Contractual Clauses” and the EU-US “Privacy Shield”) to ensure your information is subject to adequate safeguards in the recipient country. 

#### 6\. HOW WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

We take steps to ensure that the personal information that you provide is retained for only as long as it is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. After this period it will be deleted or in some cases anonymised. For example, where you have made a purchase with us, we will keep a record of your purchase for the period necessary for invoicing, tax and warranty purposes. We may also keep a record of correspondence with you (for example if you have made a complaint) for as long as is necessary to protect us from a legal claim. 

Where we have collected the personal information based on your consent and we have no other lawful basis to continue with that processing, if you subsequently withdraw your consent then we will delete your personal information. However, please note that where you unsubscribe from our marketing communications, we will keep a record of your email address to ensure we do not send you marketing emails in future.

#### 7\. SECURITY AND PASSWORDS

You must keep your password and any other authentication information for our website confidential. If you know or suspect that anyone other than you knows your password or any other authentication information, you must promptly notify us using the contact details below.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted during your use of our website.

#### 8\. DISCLOSING YOUR INFORMATION

We may share your personal information within our group of companies (i.e. our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006).

  *   * **if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation or request; or**
  * to protect the rights, property or safety of us or our users, or others, and in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions (this includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction).
