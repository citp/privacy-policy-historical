		check the applicable privacy policy of such party when providing personally identifiable information. Visitors 
		should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, 
		e-mail address) on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas of Infogroup Inc. sites, that information, along
