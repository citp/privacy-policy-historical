We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you (e.g., by issuing an e-mail to the e-mail address you provided when you registered) of any change of ownership; merger or acquisition of SalesHood by a third party, and you may choose to modify any of your registration information at that time.

### Principles

SalesHood shall provide the Individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Information to SalesHood, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before SalesHood uses or discloses the Information for a purpose other than for which is was originally collected.

ChoiceSalesHood will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their Personal Information is (1) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party or (2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For Sensitive Personal Information, SalesHood will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt in) consent to the disclosure of their information to a non-agent third party or the use of their information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

Onward Transfers to Agents SalesHood will obtain assurances from its agents that they will safeguard Personal Information consistent with this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided by agents include: a contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles, being subject to EU Directive 95/46/EC (the Data Protection Directive), Safe Harbor certification by the agent, or being subject to another European Commission adequacy finding. Where SalesHood has knowledge that an agent is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner contrary to this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy, SalesHood will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure.

Data Security SalesHood shall take reasonable steps to protect the Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. SalesHood has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. SalesHood cannot guarantee the security of Information on or transmitted via the Internet.

Data Integrity SalesHood shall only process Personal Information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, SalesHood shall take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.

AccessUpon request, SalesHood will grant individuals reasonable access to Personal Information that it holds about them. In addition, SalesHood will take reasonable steps to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete.
