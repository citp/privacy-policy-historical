# Privacy Policy | Salvex

This Privacy Policy Statement describes the privacy practices of Salvex, Inc., (the "Company" or "we") with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, including in respect to information collected from individuals or entities listing products for sale or bidding for the purchase of Products on the Company's website located at http://salvex.com/ ("Salvex Website") or otherwise accessing or utilizing the Salvex Website ("Users"). This Privacy Policy Statement is part of Salvex Web Site Terms and Conditions. This Privacy Policy Statement may be supplemented or modified by agreements entered into between the Company and an User from time to time.

Where we have provided a translation of the English language version of this Privacy Statement, such translation is provided for Users’ convenience only. To the extent there is any inconsistency between the English language version of this Privacy Statement and any such translation, the English language version shall govern.

In this Privacy Policy Statement, "personal information" means any information about an identifiable User, excluding any information that has been made anonymous or that is excluded from the definition of "personal information" under applicable laws.

This Privacy Policy Statement will notify Users of:

  * What personal information or third party personal information is collected through Salvex Website
  * How the information is used
  * With whom the information may be shared
  * What choices are available to Users regarding collection, use and distribution of personal information
  * The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of personal information under our control
  * How Users can correct any inaccuracies in their personal information



### Information Collection

Except where otherwise required or permitted by law, we will inform Users of the purposes for the collection, use, or disclosure of the Users’ personal information prior to collecting, using or disclosing the personal information. We collect personal information from Users through various means, including through Salvex Website and through user registration. Requirements for consent to collection, use, or disclosure of personal information vary depending on circumstances and on the type of personal information that is intended to be collected, used, or disclosed. In determining whether consent is required and, if so, which form of consent is appropriate, we will take into account both the sensitivity of the personal information at issue and the purposes for which we will use the information. Consent may be express, implied (including through use of "opt-out" consent where appropriate), or deemed. For example, if a User provides his/her/its mailing address and requests information regarding a particular Product, consent to use the address to mail product information to the User is implied. On giving reasonable written notice to the Company, a User may withdraw consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of his/her/its personal information. Upon receipt of this withdrawal, we will notify the User of the likely consequences of withdrawing his/her/its consent. Except where otherwise required or permitted by law, the company will then stop collecting, using or disclosing the User’s personal information.

### Information Use

We use information collected from Users to provide Products or services (including disclosure of personal information to third parties as required to provide those Products or services, and as described herein), to respond to requests for information regarding the Company’s Products and services, and for additional purposes that may be identified at or before the time that the information is collected. The information gathered will be used for general corporate marketing purposes, thereby enabling us to refine and improve our service and better meet our customers' needs. The information gathered may also be used by the Company to resolve disputes, collect fees, troubleshoot problems, enforce our Salvex Web Site Terms and Conditions and related policies, and prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities. We will not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the User or as required or permitted by law. Once the information is no longer required to fulfill its intended purposes, and is no longer required or permitted to be retained for legal or business purposes, it will be destroyed, erased, or made anonymous.

### Information Disclosure

We are the sole owner of the information collected on this site and will not share or rent this information to others in any way other than as disclosed in this Privacy Policy Statement. By using the Salvex Website to buy or sell, Users consent to our disclosing relevant contact information of Sellers and Buyers to each other to the extent necessary to perform Salvex’s services in connection with a Listing Description (or in some cases, Salvex services requested by User and provided that are unrelated to a Salvex AuctionTM or Listed Description), or in the event of a dispute between the parties. We may disclose certain personal information to third parties and to affiliated entities in order to carry out work on behalf of the Company or in connection with the operation of affiliated or hosted marketplace venues. We will take appropriate steps to ensure that such recipients safeguard the personal information and use the information only for authorized purposes. If we partner with another party to provide specific services, and a User registers for these services, we will share the contact information or other information necessary for the third party to provide the requested services. We may also disclose personal information to legal, financial, and other professional advisors and to our lenders or insurers in connection with the operation of our business, or in connection with the sale or reorganization of all or part of our business or operations. In respect of our fraud detection and prevention efforts or the investigation of unlawful activities, we may collect and disclose personal information in cooperation with law enforcement authorities. We may also collect and provide personal information to other third parties in response to a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, or when we in good faith believe disclosure is required by any applicable law, regulation or legal process. By using the Salvex Website, Users agree to allow us to use Users’ remarks, suggestions, writings or comments as we so determine without Users’ further consent and without compensation or any other interests or rights. However, we will not identify the specific source of the comments by name or email address without your permission.
