For example, a website may use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you, your preferences, or the pages you last visited.</p><p>Your browser software can be set to reject all cookies, or to ask you if you would like to accept or decline a cookie from a particular site before it is set. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the Help section of the toolbar. You should know, however, that if you reject a cookie, certain functions and conveniences of a site may not work properly.</p><p>We use cookies on our website for the following purposes:</p><ul><li>Store and sometimes track visitor preferences</li><li>Record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart</li><li>Customise web page content on visitors browser type or other information that the visitor sends</li><li>Analysis and evaluation of our advertising campaigns</li><li>Remarketing activity, showing interest based advertising across the Internet</li><li>We will never link the cookie to your personal information</li></ul><p>For certain advertising campaigns and general web traffic analysis, we will make use of 3rd party (including but not limited to Amazon) tracking solutions . Data collected by these 3rd parties on behalf of the University will not be used, either by us or the 3rd party, for any purposes other than those stated above.</p><h2>Registration for access</h2><p>Some websites require you to provide some personal information through a registration process in order to take advantage of certain website features and to access content areas. For example, a registration form might request your name, telephone number and e-mail address. You might also be asked to voluntarily provide a list of topics that you are interested in so your website experience can be customised to your specific interests and needs.</p><p>Access to some of the features on this website requires registration,and the disclosure of some personal information, which may include:</p><ul><li>Your name</li></ul><h2>Interactive services and tools</h2><p>Interactive services and tools provide website users with a richer and more valuable experience. The tools can provide you with information that is customised according to your personal background and needs.</p><p>Some interactive tools may request identifying personal information in order to function. It is important for you to know how your information will be used when it is requested, for what purposes it may also be used, and if it will be shared with any other party.</p><p>This site does not use interactive tools that ask you for identifying personal information.</p><h2>Security of communications</h2><p>We recognise that many people are concerned about the privacy and protection of information as it is transmitted over the Internet. You should keep in mind that the possibility exists for unauthorised individuals to intercept any email message you send over the Internet. In some cases, information can be encrypted (scrambled or encoded) to make it very difficult to read if it is intercepted during communication. Certain technology and practices allow websites to provide an increased level of security for your personal information when appropriate.</p><p>We use the following practices on our website to enhance the level of security for communication and the transmission of personal information:</p><ul><li>We have taken reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of personally identifiable information that you may provide</li><li>We use e-mail forms to allow our customers to ask questions about our services and programs. These are not hosted on a secure server. The possibility exists that unauthorised individuals may intercept email messages</li><li>We are not responsible for the privacy of e-mail messages except those stored in our system</li><li>When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial or health information, we redirect visitors to a secure server and will notify visitors through a pop-up screen on our site</li><li>We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site</li></ul><h2>E-Commerce, online donations, and online shopping</h2><p>Purchasing items or making donations over the Internet usually requires you to provide your personal identifying information and credit card information on a website. Many people have become accustomed to on-line commerce as a time-saving and useful convenience. There are a number of practices that can make providing your sensitive credit card information more secure and therefore make you feel more comfortable about doing so.</p><p>At this time, we do not process credit card payments for donations, merchandise, or services on our website.</p><h2>International Enquiries</h2><p>The data sent in international enquiries to the University for UG and PG programmes via webform will be held by Hobsons plc, on behalf of the University of Salford.

Certain websites have developed relationships with third-party advertising servers to display these advertisements on their sites. By clicking on one of these banner ads, you will be taken to another site with different privacy policies. These third party ad servers may also use cookies to collect non-personal information on your preferences and interests via the advertisement you decide to view.</p><p>At this time, we do not partner with or have special relationships with any advertising server companies.</p><h2>Links to other sites</h2><p>Websites often provide a number of links that offer direct access to other useful or interesting websites holding potential value to site visitors. Inclusion of the other sites by links does not imply any endorsement of the material or information on the other sites. Users are encouraged to review the privacy statement of each linked site before sharing personal information.</p><p>This site includes links to non-affiliated external websites.
