<p><a name="_Toc267994672" id="_Toc267994672"><strong>A.&nbsp; Salary.com, Inc. Online  Privacy Policy</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>
  This Online Privacy Policy covers  use of the site www.salary.com. All information disclosed by visitors is  subject to this Privacy Policy. With respect to data received through its  websites, Salary.com will comply with the following:</p>
<p><a name="_Toc267994673" id="_Toc267994673"><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Types and  Uses of Information</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>
  Salary.com gathers personal  information from site visitors from time to time in order to enhance existing  offerings or provide additional services. The company gathers only the  information essential for understanding visitors in such a way as to provide  better compensation and talent management products and services. This may  include contact information such as name, email address, telephone number, and  company name, and perhaps other data. </p>
<p>  Salary.com also may monitor customer  traffic patterns and site usage to help refine and improve the design and  layout of the website as well as the user experience. As a result, Salary.com  automatically tracks certain information about site visitors. This information  includes the users' browser type, most recent URL and the next URL that the  user visits, regardless of whether these URLs are on the Salary.com website or  not. Salary.com also will track visitors' IP addresses. Salary.com uses this  information to, among other things, identify broad demographic trends that may  be used to provide information tailored to users' interests. </p>
<p>  Visitors may choose to purchase  detailed personal salary reports and other compensation offerings. In order to  do so, visitors must disclose detailed personal information including  demographical, compensation, work experience and salary related data. In  addition, visitors are required to register and receive a logon name in order  to be able to access and use certain features of the Salary.com website. <br>
  Any personal information given to us  through our website is used exclusively by Salary.com unless otherwise noted on  the site. Salary.com does not make this information available to third parties  who trade or rent information for direct marketing purposes. </p>
<p>  Salary.com does not collect e-mail  addresses without the site visitor voluntarily providing us with this  information (typically via our online information or demo request form,  whitepaper request form, and other website forms and surveys). Salary.com will  periodically use that contact information to send visitors e-mail or other  communications for sales, service, support and marketing purposes. Visitors who  do not wish to receive marketing e-mail from Salary.com in the future may opt  out of receiving these communications by following the instructions included in  each communication. </p>
<p><a name="_Toc267994674" id="_Toc267994674"><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Third-Party Ad Servers</strong></a><strong> and alternative Third Parties</strong><br>
  Salary.com may use third-party ad  server companies to serve or present the ads that appear on the Salary.com  destination website. These companies may use information about you and your  visits to the Salary.com and other websites in order to provide advertisements  on the Salary.com destination website and other sites about goods and services  that may be of interest to you. We may partner with advertising networks to  help present advertisements on our sites, including online behavioral  advertising.&nbsp; These advertising networks use cookies to help present,  better target, and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements, using  data gathered over time and across their networks to determine the  characteristics and preferences of their audience. Salary.com may also set  cookies on your computer during your visit to our website on behalf of third  parties other than third party ad server companies or third party network  advertising providers. These alternative third parties collect  non-personally-identifiable data and information regarding your internet use  and the sites you visit. They may use this data or information to: (i) provide  data or information products and services to Salary.com which may be used  internally or, Salary.com may sell or distribute such data or information to  third parties; (ii) provide data and information products and services direct  to third party customers of the data collector. Salary.com does not authorize  these third parties to store personally identifiable information about you in  their cookies; nor for their own internal analytics. </p>
<p>  If you would like more information  about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by companies  that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to provide targeted ads,  please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>. </p>
<p><a name="_Toc267994675" id="_Toc267994675"><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Credit  card information</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>
  When a customer places an order  online with Salary.com, their credit card information is protected through the  use of encryption such as the Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol.  SSL makes it difficult for credit card information to be intercepted or stolen  while being transmitted.</p>
<p><a name="_Toc267994676" id="_Toc267994676"><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>
  Salary.com and its advertising  partners may use both per-session and persistent cookies to enhance the user  experience while visiting the Salary.com website. Cookies are small bits of  data stored locally by a browser that saves information and helps the hosting  website identify the user upon subsequent visits. Cookies are uniquely assigned  to the users' computer and may only be read by a web server located within the  domain that originally issued the cookie. Cookies generally assist users by  performing certain functions such as saving passwords and personal preferences  regarding the sites. Salary.com also uses a third party targeting cookie  provided by its authorized third party partner’s tag. This cookie is used to  record a user’s site behavior. It is a persistent cookie. </p>
<p>Persistent cookies are stored  for a set length of time determined by the web server when it passes the cookie  on to the browser. Persistent cookies are used to store information between  visits to a site.</p>
<p>  Per-session cookies are used to  store information only within a session. These cookies are cached only while a  user is visiting the web server that issues the per-session cookie. Per-session  cookies are deleted from the cache when the user closes the session. Users may  have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically  accept cookies, but users can typically modify browser settings to decline all  cookies. Alternatively, users may modify browser settings to provide  notification each time a cookie is tendered, permitting the user to accept or  decline cookies on an individual basis. If a user chooses to decline cookies,  however, it may hinder performance and negatively impact the user experience on  Salary.com's website, and ultimately, the use of any hosted compensation and  talent management software. </p>
<p><a name="_Toc267994677" id="_Toc267994677"><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Disclosure to Salary.com partners</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>
  Salary.com does not provide detailed  information about individual site visits, nor the information users provide, to  outside companies without users' permission. Salary.com may share aggregated  information about the use of this site to companies with which Salary.com has  business relationships. This usage information, such as numbers and frequency  of visits, is used to attract appropriate advertisers to various areas of the  site. Salary.com provides this data so that advertisers and other businesses  can better understand how people use partners' content and the Salary.com site,  with the goal of providing the best possible web experience.</p>
<p><a name="_Toc267994678" id="_Toc267994678"><strong>B.&nbsp; Salary.com, Inc. SaaS  Privacy Policy</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p><a name="_Toc267994679" id="_Toc267994679"><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>

<p>  This SaaS Privacy Policy applies  only to the transfer of personally identifiable information ("Personal  Information") received by Salary.com in any format through its hosted  solutions, whether supplied directly by Salary.com customers or by employees or  users of the hosted solutions anywhere in the world, including transfers from  the European Union and Canada to the United States.

  Salary.com supports a hosted system,  where it collects Personal Information including but not limited to customers'  organizational data (salary and compensation figures and structures, job  descriptions, job codes, reporting relationships), employee data (specific  identifying information such as name, email/physical address, current/previous  base salary, performance ratings, skills, skill gaps, qualifications,  certifications, gender, ethnicity, language, picture, resume and other  demographical information), market data (salary surveys that clients have  purchased) and other data required to provide payroll and HR services for  customers and their employees.

The Salary.com customer is responsible for giving its  employees and users the appropriate level of notification that Personal  Information is being collected and maintained. The Salary.com customer also is  responsible for ensuring the security of any method used by the customer to  provide Personal Information to Salary.com if through means other than the  hosted solution.</p>
<p><a name="_Toc267994681" id="_Toc267994681"><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Onward  Transfer</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>
  Salary.com is a global corporation with  operations in several countries. Salary.com has developed global data practices  designed to ensure that Personal Information is appropriately protected. While  Salary.com's primary data centers are in the United States, Personal  Information may be transferred to our offices in other countries. Salary.com  also may contract with third-party providers to perform certain functions on  our behalf or to enhance our existing product and service offerings. Examples  include providing financial transaction, product and service support. If  Salary.com discloses Personal Information to a third party or to our employees  outside of the United States, Salary.com will ensure adequate protection of  such Personal Information. Third parties will have access to your Personal Information  only to the extent necessary to permit them to do their jobs; however, they are  bound by confidentiality agreements before any information is provided to them  and are restricted from using the information for other purposes.</p>
<p><a name="_Toc267994682" id="_Toc267994682"><strong>C.&nbsp; Salary.com General Privacy  Provisions</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>

All  information disclosed by site visitors, customers and other individuals or  organizations is subject to these provisions. With respect to data received  through Salary.com's website and its hosted solutions, Salary.com will comply  with the following: </p>
<p><a name="_Toc267994683" id="_Toc267994683"><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data  Integrity and Access to Data</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>
  Salary.com will take reasonable  steps to ensure that Personal Information is accurate, complete and current to  its intended use. Salary.com will only use Personal Information in ways that  are compatible for the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently  authorized by the user. </p>
<p>  Salary.com provides users with  reasonable access to Personal Information that they provide to us as well as  the ability to review and correct such information. In addition, to protect  users' privacy and security, Salary.com takes reasonable steps to verify user  identity before granting access to Personal Information. Salary.com may limit  or deny access to Personal Information where providing such access would be  unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the circumstances. </p>
<p><a name="_Toc267994684" id="_Toc267994684"><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Security</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>
  To prevent unauthorized access or  disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, to allow only the appropriate exercise  of users' Personal Information while also protecting the confidentiality,  integrity and availability of users' Personal Information, Salary.com employs a  variety of industry standard security technologies. Security is provided on the  data, application and hosting level. The security infrastructure includes a  physically secure data center, proven firewall protection, intrusion prevention  measures, SSL encryption of all data in transit, role based authorization and  additional proprietary security measures. Communication to Salary.com servers  from a client computer is achieved through an SSL connection. This ensures  data, including Personal Information, is encrypted when transferred over the  Internet. Salary.com provides further user-based security configured  specifically for the individual client's needs. For example, as a  TalentManager® subscriber, the client will be able to specify levels of user  security, including: domain-limited access (access only from the client's proxy  server), password configuration (length, letters, numbers, etc.) and automatic  password expiration.</p>
<p>  Salary.com limits access to users'  Personal Information and data to those persons who have a specific business  purpose for maintaining and processing such information. Salary.com's employees  who have access to users' Personal Information will be made aware of their  responsibilities to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of  that information and have been provided training and instruction on how to do  so.</p>
<p><a name="_Toc267994685" id="_Toc267994685"><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Enforcement</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>
  Salary.com has a Privacy Officer who  is responsible for Salary.com's compliance with and enforcement of this Policy.
