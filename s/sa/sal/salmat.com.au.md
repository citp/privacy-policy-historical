# Salmat - Salmat’s privacy policy. Guidelines pertaining to how Salmat adheres to the Privacy Act 1988 (Australia).

## Introduction 

This Privacy Statement applies to the Salmat.com.au website and to all business activities of Salmat Limited (ABN 11 002 724 638) and its subsi­diary companies ("Salmat") to the extent that they affect or involve the collection, use, disclosure or handling of personal information. 

Salmat understands the importance to its c­lients and to their ­customers of the discreet and confidential handling of their personal information. It is Salmat's policy to comply with the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988 and the National Privacy Principles contained in that Act in all activities of Salmat involving the collection, use, disclosure and handling of personal information. 

In this Privacy Statement, personal information means information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion (source: Privacy Act 1988). 

## Collection 

Whether for Salmat or its clients, Salmat will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably intrusive way. 

Where practicable, Salmat will make known the purpose for which it is collecting personal information and will colle­ct personal information concerning an individual only from that individual. 

­ 

## Use and Disclosure 

Salmat will not use personal information concerning an individual for a purpose other than the primary purpose for which it was collected, unless Salmat or its client has obtained the consent of the individual to the use of that information for a secondary use, such as direct marketing. 

If it is not practicable to obtain the individual's consent and the individual has made known to Salmat or Salmat's client the individual's desire not to receive any further direct marketing communications, Salmat will cease any direct marketing communications to the individual. 

In addition, Salmat is a member of the Australian Direct Marketing Association (ADMA) and subscribes to its "do not mail" and "do not call" lists. 

Personal information collected and/or stored for one client is never used for or disclosed to another client or to any other third party. 

## Data Quality 

Salmat will take all reasonable steps to ensure that personal information that it holds is accurate, complete and up-to-date. 

## Data Security 

Salmat prides itself on the sophistication of its data security systems, networks and procedures. In particular all databases maintained by Salmat are protected by secure network links, which are complemented by firewalls, hardware and software encryption, password protection, virus protection and internal quality procedures. All Salmat staff are required to sign confidentiality undertakings which extend to client information. 

## Openness 

On request by individuals, Salmat will make known to those individuals the types of personal information it holds, the purpose for which it is held and how Salmat collects, holds and uses that information. 

## Access and Correction 

On request by an individual, but subject to the exceptions prescribed by the National Privacy Principles, either Salmat or its client for whom the information is held will provide the individual with access to their personal information and will allow that individual a reasonable opportunity to correct any inaccuracies or out-of-date information. 

A request for access to the personal information held by Salmat concerning an individual can be made by that individual to Salmat's Privacy Committee on the numbers or address mentioned below or, if so specified, to Salmat's client. A fee may apply. 

## Identifiers 

Salmat will not use tax file numbers or other government-issued identifiers, other than the ABN, to identify a record of personal information relating to an individual. 

## Anonymity 

Where practicable, Salmat will maintain the anonymity of an individual in a database of personal information unless the identity of the individual is necessary to perform a lawful activity. 

## Transborder data flows 

Salmat will not transfer personal information relating to an individual outside Australia unless the individual has consented to such a transfer or Salmat has satisfied itself that the recipient of the personal information will uphold principles for the handling of personal information which are similar to the National Privacy Principles. 

## Sensitive and Health Information 

Salmat will apply particularly stringent procedures to its collection, use, disclosure and handling of any personal information which includes sensitive information (e.g., information concerning race, religion, political affiliations) or health information (e.g., information concerning an individual's medical condition). 

## Salmat's Clients 

As Australia's leading customer communications company, Salmat will be engaged by its clients to perform various services that might involve the handling of personal information. Salmat will seek from its clients assurances that all such personal information has been collected lawfully and in compliance with the National Privacy Principles and that all required consents have been obtained for the intended use of that personal information. 

## Subcontractors 

Salmat requires strict compliance with the National Privacy Principles by all of its subcontractors.
