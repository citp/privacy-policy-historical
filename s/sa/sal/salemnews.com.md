This Policy was last modified on February 10, 2012.

## Information Practices

Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively "CNHI") understand that security and privacy are important issues for visitors to our web site, [http://www.salemnews.com](https://web.archive.org/) (the "Site") and recognize our obligations to keep your information secure and confidential. That is why we maintain the following standards to help protect information that personally identifies you. We may modify this Privacy Policy (the "Policy") at any time and, accordingly, we urge you to frequently review the Policy. We will always apply the Policy under which your information was collected, unless we obtain your prior consent for additional disclosure, or are legally required to disclose, as noted below. Please note that the Policy applies only to information collected by us through the Site, as specified below, and unless expressly stated otherwise, does not govern or apply to any information collected or used by CNHI including, but not limited to, [http://www.salemnews.com](https://web.archive.org/) through other means.

## Collection of Information

You may be asked to voluntarily provide your name, billing address, shipping address, phone number, credit card number, e-mail address or other personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") to make purchases or to have access to some features of the Site. By using the Site and providing us with your Personal Information, you consent to our use of such information as described in this Policy. You may always refuse to provide your Personal Information, and this may lead to our inability to provide you with certain products or services. We or our business partners may also collect information that is anonymous, such as your IP number (a number used to identify your computer on the Internet) or the type of browser you are using ("Anonymous Information"), through the use of cookies or by other means. Because this information helps us in evaluating how our visitors use and navigate the Site on an aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of visitors to each page of the Site, and the length of visits, we hope that, by using Anonymous Information, we can update the Site to make it more useful to you and other users. We reserve the right to maintain, update, disclose or otherwise use Anonymous Information, without limitation.

## Use of Information

We use your Personal Information for the following purposes: to process your orders and administer your account; to administer and improve the Site and related services; to personalize the content of the Site to your preferences; to process requests made by you; to notify you of our products, services, promotional events or special offers that maybe of interest to you; to provide Internet security; where reasonably necessary to enforce our Legal Terms and Conditions of Use; and if there is a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request. CNHI may work with our business partners who may perform certain functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, sending e-mail messages, managing data, processing credit card payments or providing customer service. These business partners have access to your Personal Information only to the extent necessary to perform these specific functions and may not use it for any other purpose. Other than for the specific purposes set forth in this Policy, we will not disclose your Personal Information unless we obtain your prior consent or are legally required to do so. We may use third party advertising companies to place ads on the Site and to place our ads on other web sites. These companies may use Anonymous Information about your visits to this and other web sites to provide advertisements on the Site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If CNHI is involved in the sale of a substantial portion of its business assets, Anonymous or Personal Information may be among the transferred assets.

## E-mail Communications

In an attempt to protect your privacy, if we send you an e-mail, then our communication will not include sensitive personal account information, such as credit card information. We recommend that you do not include such information in e-mail communications directed to us. We may communicate with you by postal mail, e-mail or by posting notices on the Site. All agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

## Privacy of Children

We encourage parents and guardians to be aware of and participate in their children's online activities. The Site is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. We strictly adhere to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and will not knowingly collect, use or disclose Personal Information from any child under the age of 13 in any manner that violates this law. Please note that the Site may contain links to other sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties ("Third Party Sites") which may request Personal Information from children under the age of 13. CNHI is not responsible for the collection or use of Personal Information collected from any child under the age of 13 at any Third Party Sites.
