Once the maximum storage period is reached, your personal data will be anonymised or destroyed/erased safely.

The most significant data storage periods are as follows:

i. Loyalty programme management - we retain all your personal data for 3 years after your last purchase at a Salsa store or at the online store. If you have not made any purchases, we keep you personal data for 3 years after your registration in the loyalty programme;

ii. Marketing and direct marketing – if you are a Customer of the loyalty programme we retain your data for 3 years after your last purchase or, if you have not made any purchases, 3 years after your registration in the programme. Otherwise, the retention period is 2 years after your last reaction to our communications (e.g. opening an e-mail, clicking on a link sent by text message, etc.);
