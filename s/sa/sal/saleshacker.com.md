At Sales Hacker, we appreciate your use of and contributions to our website, our conference websites, our mobile conference apps, our content, and ultimately our greater digital community.

  * Company



This may occur, for example, when you register for a webinar, or download an eBook from our website. Specifically, this happens when you explicitly complete a form on our website to access any type of content.

### 2) Cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technology

We use various technologies to collect information automatically when you access our web properties and consume our content – this is including but not limited to cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies. We may also use trusted third party services that track this information on our behalf.

Cookies are bits of electronic information that can be transferred to your computer or other electronic device to uniquely identify your browser.

When you access our content, we may place one or more cookies on your computer or other electronic device or use other technologies that provide similar functionality.

The use of cookies helps us improve the quality and relevance of content displayed to you, by identifying information which is most interesting to you, and helps us measure the effectiveness of our advertising.

At any time, you may adjust settings on your browser to refuse cookies according to the instructions related to your browser.

You may also choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Chrome) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.

If you disable cookies, some features will be disabled, and your site experience is likely to be less efficient as some of our services may not function properly.

### 3) Country data based on your IP

If you register for a webinar or download an eBook, for example, we may collect the location of your device based on your IP address. This helps us delineate where you located in the world, and based on that, we will follow each country’s data compliance regulations to their fullest effect.

All Sales Hacker emails will include a link in the footer, where you can select your communication preferences or unsubscribe altogether.

Also, you can manage your receipt of some types of communication by following the instructions included in the email we send you.

Please note that, even if you unsubscribe from certain email correspondences, we may still need to email you in the event there is an important transactional or administrative issue we need to resolve with you. An example of this might be processing a refund for an event ticket that you can no longer attend.

## **When do we share and disclose your information?**

Your privacy is extremely important to us and we are committed to protecting your information that identifies you personally. We will only share personal information that you provide us under the following circumstances:

### **1) With your consent**

When you explicitly consent or allow Sales Hacker to share your personal information. This happens when you submit your information through many of our content offers, events or services.

For example, if you choose to sign up for an exclusive piece of premium content via a form – your name, phone number, email address, job title, and company will be collected by Sales Hacker.

### **2) Service providers to Sales Hacker**

When Sales Hacker hires a service provider to help operate the Services or our business, we may give access to personal information only as appropriate to perform the service for Sales Hacker, and subject to the terms of this privacy policy.

## **How do we protect visitor information?**

Our website is scanned on a regular basis for security breaches and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible.

We use regular Malware Scanning, as well as an SSL certificate.

### **Third Party Disclosure**

When you register for a sponsored event, your information may be shared with our event partners. You may opt out of communications at any time.

### **Third party links**

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

### **Google**

Google’s advertising requirements can be summed up by Google’s Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en

We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.

Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.

**We have implemented the following:**

  * Remarketing with Google AdSense
  * Demographics and Interests Reporting



We along with third-party vendors, such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions, and other ad service functions as they relate to our website.

### **Opting out:**

Users can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Settings page. Alternatively, you can opt out by visiting the Network Advertising initiative opt out page or permanently using the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on.

### **How does our site handle do not track signals?**

We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.

### **COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)**

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.

We do not specifically market to children under 13.

### **Fair Information Practices**

The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

**In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:**

  * Within 1 Business Day we will notify the users via email and site notifications:  




We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

### **CAN SPAM Act**

The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.

### **We collect your email address in order to:**

  * Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.
  * Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred



### **To be in accordance with CAN-SPAM we agree to the following:**

  * NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses.
  * Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.
  * Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.
  * Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
  * Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.
  * Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.
