We use demographic information to report marketing information to our partners and to help determine what services may be of interest to our core user group. When you REGISTER at SalesHeads, you grant permission for SalesHeads to share your registration information with its partners in any way it deems appropriate.

**Resumes (If you are a Job Seeker)**  
Since SalesHeads is a career site, we give you the option of putting your resume in our database.

On occasion we may engage in the sale or rental of certain information contained in your resume to businesses interested in collecting such information. SalesHeads may scan this database from time to time (for both searchable and confidential information) to collect email addresses for inclusion in its newsletter or for other marketing purposes for itself or its partners, affiliates or customers. There are several ways of putting your resume into our database(s). If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all recruiters who pay for access to our resume database product will have access to your resume. We use our best efforts to grant access to this database only to paying recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals. However, we are not responsible if a third party, such as someone posing as the aforementioned and paying for the service, evades security measures and gains access to the database and, subsequently, your resume. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, recruiters who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances.
