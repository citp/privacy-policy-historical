  <strong>WEBSITE PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong>
</center>
<p>Welcome to the website for the Salisbury Post, <a href="http://www.salisburypost.com">www.salisburypost.com</a> (the "Site"). This Site is an online service owned by Post Publishing Company, Inc. (the "Company" or "us"), and powered by  Mediaspan Online Services ("Mediaspan"). We recognize that many  visitors to our website are concerned about the information that they  provide to us or that may be collected, and how we treat that  information. In order to address those concerns we have developed this  Website Privacy Statement. </p>
<p><strong>A.	TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong></p>
<p>At this website, we may collect both personally identifiable information and non-personal information from you. </p>
<p>1. <strong>Personally identifiable information</strong>. You don't have to  provide us with your personally identifiable information (such as your  name, address, telephone number, email address, etc.) in order to read  most of what's posted on this Site. We may, however, collect personally  identifiable information about you when you submit comments in response  to one of our stories, sign up to receive information from us, open an  account with us, submit a letter to the editor through the Site, enter  a contest, respond to a survey, make a forum submission, email us,  purchase something through the Site, or at times in which we alert you  that you must submit personally identifiable information. Without this  information, we would not be able to respond to your inquiries, entries  and requests. Please also note that several features of the Site, such  as classified ads and blogs, may be operated by third parties. These  third parties may also obtain personally identifiable information from  you in order to use their services. Please check their privacy policies  for information about their privacy practices. In some cases these  third parties may provide your personally identifiable information to  the Company.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Non-personal information</strong>. Non-personal information, such  as which pages on the Site are accessed, what information is  downloaded, what type of browser and operating system are being used,  which Internet service provider is being used, and other information of  this general type may be collected about visitors to the Site. This  information does not allow us to personally identify the Site visitor.  By collecting this information we learn how best to develop our website  to meet the needs and desires of our visitors.</p>
<p><strong>B.	METHODS OF INFORMATION COLLECTION</strong></p>
<p>Personally identifiable information is collected when submitted by  you - such as when you sign up for an account with us or when you send  us an email. Personally identifiable information may also be collected  when you include it as part of a comment, letter, forum submission or  blog entry that you submit to us. Your personally identifiable  information may be collected by third party service providers and then  provided to the Company by the third party. Non-personal information  may be collected via "cookies" (small text files placed on your  computer's hard drive), "web beacons" or other technology. </p>
<p><strong>C.	HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>Personally identifiable information</strong>. If you sign up for an  account with us (which is required in order to make certain  submissions), then we may use your personally identifiable information  to maintain your account and to correspond with you. We may also use it  to send you materials that we think would be of interest to you. We may  also provide your personally identifiable information to advertisers or  others. If you enter one of our contests, then we may use your  personally identifiable information for purposes of the contest (such  as to notify you if you win) and/or in accordance with the contest  rules. We may also provide your personally identifiable information to  the sponsor(s) of the contest, publish information concerning the  winner of the contest, and/or for any other lawful purposes. If you  email us, submit a letter to us, or ask to be placed on a mailing list  that we maintain, then we may contact you and send information to you.  If you register to purchase merchandise through this website, then we  may use your personally identifiable information to maintain your  account and/or process your order. If we receive your personally  identifiable information from a third party service provider, then we  may use the information to contact you and to assist in performing the  service for which you have registered with the third party. In addition  to the uses listed above, we may use your personally identifiable  information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, as part  of a statistical website usage analysis, and/or to improve the features  and content of this website. We may also use your personally  identifiable information to assist in delivery of content that is  customized to your interests. We do not collect personally identifiable  information on an automatic basis, but we may combine non-personal  information (which may be automatically collected) with your previously  submitted personally identifiable information. We may also use your  personally identifiable information as set forth elsewhere in this  Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Non-personal information</strong>. We may use your non-personal  information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, as part  of a statistical website usage analysis, to improve the features and  content of this website, and/or for other purposes to assist our  business. We may share such information with advertisers and other  third parties, typically in the aggregate. We may also use your  non-personal information as set forth elsewhere in this Privacy  Statement.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Links from the Site to advertisers and other third parties</strong>.  Please be aware that the Company's advertisers, business partners,  sponsors, service providers and other third parties accessible through  the Site (such as via links from this Site and/or framed on this Site)  may have their own privacy practices. The Company is not responsible  for any actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the  applicable privacy policies of the third parties when providing  information to them. These third parties may provide the personally  identifiable information that they collect to the Company and may also  use the information in accordance with their own privacy practices.  Financial institutions, such as those which process credit card orders,  are subject to federal privacy laws.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Other third parties</strong>. During the course of its business,  the Company uses third party service providers, such as lawyers and  accountants, to perform a variety of functions. In some instances, the  Company may need to provide personal and/or non-personal information  about you to such third parties. However, all third party service  providers which are not linked from the Site are prohibited from using  your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for  which they were selected to work with the Company.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Public forum</strong>. If you submit a comment, personal ad, email,  blog entry, forum entry, or similar submission, the information in your  submission may be published to the general public. Please exercise  caution when making such submissions. Please note that most such  submissions are not reviewed prior to publication. We will not be  responsible to read, respond to, or perform in accordance with any  requests for privacy or confidentiality that are included with the  submission or at any time. </p>
<p>6. <strong>Other uses</strong>. In addition to the uses set forth elsewhere in  this Privacy Statement, the Company may use or disclose personal or  non-personal information: (i) in cases where we believe in good faith  that it is necessary to prevent a crime, an injury or financial loss to  ourselves or to third parties; (ii) to protect against misuse or  unauthorized use of this Site (including violation of the Company's <a href="http://www.salisburypost.com/termsofuse/">Terms of Use</a>);  (iii) pursuant to a court order, warrant, subpoena, discovery request,  or as required by law; (iv) in conjunction with the sale or offering  for sale of some or all of the Company; (v) in the event of the  Company's bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or  similar financial circumstances; and/or (vi) when you have been made  aware of the possibility of use or disclosure of the information at or  prior to the time of collection.</p>
<p><strong>D.	OUR COMMITMENT TO SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures  that we believe are appropriate to safeguard and help prevent  unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the  information we collect online. Please note that we cannot guarantee the  security of our databases or Site, nor can we guarantee that  information will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the  Internet. In order to use some of the features of this Site, you may be  required to create an account with us. For your protection, this  account will only be accessible by means of a password or similar  security measure. If you believe that your password or email address  has been compromised, you should change your account with us  immediately. If you forget your password, follow the instructions on  the login page. </p>
<p><strong>E.	CHILDREN</strong></p>
<p>The Company does not knowingly collect personal information from  children under the age of 13 through this Site unless such collection  is done in accordance with the law. If you are a child under the age of  13 that intends to submit information to the Company through this Site,  you must obtain your parent's consent prior to making such a  submission. In the event that the Company obtains actual knowledge that  you are a child under the age of 13, the Company may require that you  (and/or your parent) prove to us your prior parental consent. Even if  you are 13 or over, we recommend that all children under the age of 18  obtain parental consent prior to the submission or purchase of anything  through this Site. </p>
<p><strong>F.	ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND "OPT OUT" PROCEDURES</strong></p>
<p>You may change your online account information with the Company by  accessing your account through the Site (if you forgot your password,  follow the instructions on the login page). If you would like to access  or change any other personal information that we have collected, or  would like to "opt out" of our collection, retention or disclosure of  any other information, please email us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@salisburypost.com">webmaster@salisburypost.com</a> or contact us at the address set forth below. Subject to the Company's  protection of itself and others, disclosures for legal reasons, and our  current technological capabilities, we may be able to assist you.  Please keep in mind that to protect your privacy and security, we may  take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you  access to any personally identifiable information or "opt out"  capabilities. To change the information that you submitted to third  party service providers, such as in conjunction with personal ads,  classified ads or blogs, please contact the service provider. Their  policies will dictate the extent to which you can access or change the  information that they have collected about you. </p>
<p><strong>G.	PARENTAL OPTIONS AND REVIEW</strong></p>
<p>Parents of children under the age of 13 have the option to agree to  the collection and use of their child's personal information without  consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties  (subject to the Company's protection of itself and others, disclosures  for legal reasons, and the Company's current technological  capabilities). In addition, parents can review the personal information  provided by their child under the age of 13, ask to have it deleted and  refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child's  information (subject to the same items as above). In order to make  these requests, parents should follow the "Opt Out" procedures set  forth in the "Access to Your Personal Information and 'Opt Out'  Procedures" section of this Privacy Statement. Please note that, while  this Site will not require more information from children under 13 than  is reasonably necessary to participate in any activity or event,  deletion of required information (such as information that would permit  the Company to contact the winner of a contest) may result in  termination of the child's participation in an event or activity.  Parents should also note that the official rules for contests and  promotions on this website may contain additional information related  to their children's privacy and the parents' rights and  responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>H.	CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Statement may be changed from time to time, so we  encourage you to check back with every visit to the Site. If you do not  agree to one or more of the changes, you may choose to "opt out," using  the procedures set forth above. Once the change has been made, all  information collected by the Site before or after the change will be  subject to the new terms of the Privacy Statement. The current version  of this Privacy Statement is effective January 8, 2007. </p>
