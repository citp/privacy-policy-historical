**Information About You.** BTA collects several types of information on our Site. BTA collects "Personal Information," which generally speaking, is information that can be used to identify you individually, such as your name and address. BTA also collects "Demographic Information", which is information about you that does not itself identify you individually. Examples of Demographic Information include your geographic location and industry sector. BTA also collects "Clickstream Information", which is information about the use of the Site, such as the Web pages visited most often. The information BTA collects depends on what services you use on the Site. The following provides a more detailed explanation of these types of information as well as when and how BTA collects and uses the information. 

**Personal Information Subscriber and Transactional Information.** When you access the Site, BTA may collect various kinds of Personal Information including your name, business name, e-mail address, phone number and credit card information.

**Customer Service and Technical Support Correspondence.** BTA may collect information that identifies you personally when you submit comments, questions or suggestions, or when you request technical support. 

**Use of Your Personal Information.** Except as expressly disclosed within this Policy, BTA neither sells nor discloses information that identifies BTA’s guests personally or makes it possible for other parties to contact them directly without the consent of the Site’s users. BTA may use, sell, disclose, or otherwise dispose of Personal Information that BTA collects in the following circumstances: 

  


  * **Subscription Delivery.** BTA may use your mailing address to send to you any subscriptions or reports that you have ordered, and your e-mail address to contact you regarding additional subscriptions, reports or services offered by BTA or BTA’s affiliated corporations.
  * **Internal Analyses, Promotions and Databases.** BTA may use information about you for BTA’s internal statistical, design, operational purposes such as to estimate the Site’s audience size; measure aggregate traffic patterns; and understand demographics, customer interest, purchasing and other trends among the Site’s guests and BTA’s subscribers. BTA may also use your Personal Information to market and/or promote BTA’s products and services, such as sending you product updates. Further, BTA may use information about you such as your industry, job title and compensation, in order to enhance BTA’s proprietary databases relating to compensation, benefits and cost-of-living information. As mentioned above, BTA’s Terms of Use governs your use of the Site and per the terms, BTA claims the exclusive right to any and all submissions made by you to BTA via the Site. BTA’s Terms of Use are accessible from the bottom portion of the Site home page: [www.btabta.com](http://www.btabta.com/).
  * **Affiliates.** If you order a subscription through a link on an affiliate Web site, BTA may share with that affiliate either your name or your company name, the amount of your purchase, and the time you made the purchase. BTA does not provide affiliates with any of your contact information.
  * **Transaction Processing.** BTA may share your Personal Information and transactional information with entities as is necessary to process credit card payments or other purchasing or delivery systems.
  * **Legal Requirement.** BTA may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform with the law, respond to claims and complaints, or comply with legal process served on BTA or the Site; or (b) protect and defend BTA’s rights or property, the Site, BTA’s employees, guests or the public.
  * **Company Sale.** Information collected through the Site is considered a trade secret of BTA. As the owner of such information, BTA may disclose or sell such information as an asset of BTA in conjunction with the sale to a third party of BTA or a portion of BTA’s assets.



**Aggregate Information:**

**Clickstream and Demographic Information.** BTA may collect Clickstream Information about you and your use of our Site whenever you visit the Site. For instance, we may collect information such as entry and exit points for the Site (i.e., referring URLs or domains), Site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, and operating system and browser type. In addition, when users request Web pages on the Site, BTA’s servers automatically log the IP address of each user. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the World Wide Web. 

Clickstream Information and Demographic Information may be aggregated for usage, sales and marketing purposes ("Aggregate Information"). When BTA aggregates such information, BTA compiles the information in a manner that describes the purchases or characteristics of users of the Site generally but does not individually identify any specific user, activity or transaction. BTA may also use third-party software that tracks traffic directed to the Site from affiliate Web sites and the purchases that result from this traffic. This information is similarly aggregated and is not tied to an individual purchase. 

BTA may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all Aggregate Information. Should BTA share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any particular user, and will not be used to contact you. Should BTA correlate any Aggregate Information to you, such information will be treated like any other Personal Information under this policy. In rare circumstances, BTA may use such information to identify a user when necessary to enforce compliance with an agreement between BTA and the user, to comply with law enforcement requests, or to protect BTA’s Site(s) or other users. 

**Cookies.** BTA may make use of "cookies" on the Site. Cookies are small text files stored on a user’s computer by a Web server based on the permissions set in a user’s browser software. A cookie itself is neither designed nor intended to read any information from a user’s computer (other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the Web sites that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customize, monitor, or regulate the use of a Web site based on information stored on the host server. Therefore, cookies only identify the user’s computer to the Web sites, which may correlate other information, including personally identifying information, with the cookie. 

BTA utilizes cookies in order to automate access and data entry functions of the Site such as correlating online ordering information, tailoring the Site to your preferences or interests, or customizing promotions or marketing. In addition, cookies allow BTA to track use of the Site to determine those areas that are useful or popular and those that are not, thereby enabling BTA to improve and update the Site. 

You may adjust your Web browsers in order to: (a.) alert you regarding the use of cookies, or (b.) allow you to refuse to accept cookies entirely. For Internet Explorer or AOL users, you can click on the "Start" button and then select "Control Panel", "Internet Options" and the "Security" tab. If you click on the "Custom" button, you will be able to see the cookie options. For Netscape users, in the browser, select "File", "Preferences" and then "Advanced" to view the cookie options. If you disable cookies, certain functions on the Site may not function properly. 

**Links to Other Sites.** Please be aware that BTA provides links to third-party Web sites as a service to guests, and BTA is not responsible for the content or information collection practices of these third-party Web sites. Please note that these third-party Web sites’ privacy policies may differ from those of BTA. BTA encourages you to review and understand the privacy practices associated with each third-party Web site before providing any third-party Web site with information. 

**Children.** The Site is intended for the use of a general audience. The Site is neither designed nor intended to collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. To respect the privacy of children and to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, children under the age of 13 should not provide any Personal Information on the Site. We ask that parents supervise their children while their children access the Internet. 

**Security.** BTA uses commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain Personal Information to protect it from loss, misuse, alternation or destruction by any unauthorized party. For example, BTA encrypts order information, including credit card numbers, using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology in order to protect customers’ information as it is sent over the Internet to BTA’s server. 

**Access.** If you would like to have Personal Information that you have submitted to BTA deleted from BTA’s system, please send your request to [info@btabta.com](mailto:info@btabta.com). 

**Opting-Out.** If you do not want BTA to use your e-mail address for BTA’s own marketing or promotional purposes, you can remove yourself from BTA’s e-mail list at any time by sending your request to [optout@btabta.com](mailto:optout@btabta.com).
