We recognize that many people are concerned about the privacy and protection of information as it is transmitted over the Internet. You should keep in mind that the possibility exists for unauthorized individuals to intercept any email message you send over the Internet. In some cases, information can be encrypted (scrambled or encoded) to make it very difficult to read if it is intercepted during communication. Certain technology and practices allow websites to provide an increased level of security for your personal information when appropriate.

We use the following practices on our website to enhance the level of security for communication and the transmission of personal information:

  * We have taken reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of personally identifiable information that you may provide
