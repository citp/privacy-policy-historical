3. _Web Beacons/Web Bugs (Clear GIFs/ Single-Pixel GIFs)_ : Advertisements that appear on our website are sometimes delivered by third party advertisers.  These third party advertisers may use web beacons or web bugs to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.
