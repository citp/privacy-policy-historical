<h1>SAS Institute Inc. </h1>
<hr>
<h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
<p>Our business customers' privacy is important to us. To better protect that privacy, SAS is providing this notice to explain our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. </p>
<h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
<h4>Personal Information</h4>
<p>   
In general, you can visit the SAS Web site without telling 
us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you. Personal information like your name, address and e-mail address is obtained only when voluntarily submitted, such as when you subscribe to newsletters, respond to user surveys, register for programs or events or license software. Information that you supply will relate to the customer relationship that SAS has with 



you or your organization. 
</p><h4>How We Use It</h4>
If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we or our business partners request, it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information. 
<p>SAS will use your personal information to fulfill subscription requests and orders for software and services made online and to provide other services you request. We may also use the information you supply to:
</p><ul>
<li>Make the Web site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once. 
</li><li>Help us customize content most relevant to you. 
</li><li>Notify you about important news concerning SAS, including new products and services, product updates and technical support issues, and special offers we think you may be interested in. 
</li></ul>
In the process of administering our site, we maintain and track usage through Web server logs.
Web server logs provide such information as what types of browsers are accessing our site, what pages receive
high traffic, and the times of day our servers experience significant load. We use this information to
improve the content and navigation features of our site. Anonymized or aggregated forms of this data may
be used to identify future features and functions to develop for the site and provide better customer service.
We do analyze some of our web services, such as Demos and Downloads, at the individual level in order to improve
the quality of those offerings and to better tailor our marketing to our customer needs.  In general,
web analysis data is not used to identify you personally.
<h4>How We Share It </h4>
We will not sell, rent or lease to others your personally identifiable information.
We will share the personal data you provide only with other SAS entities and/or business partners
except as provided below (see <a href="#consent">Consent</a>).
<h3><a name="consent">Consent</a></h3>
SAS will use and share the personally identifiable information you provided to us in ways related to those described above. We reserve the right to disclose any and all pertinent customer information to law enforcement or other government officials as we,



 in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.
<h3>Our Commitment to Data Security </h3>
SAS is concerned about the security of your 
information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We use encryption technology when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information. 
<h3>External Links</h3>
Links to third-party Web sites from the SAS Web site are provided solely as a convenience to you. If you use these links, you will leave the SAS site. We have not reviewed these third-party sites and do not control them. SAS does not assume responsibility



 for any of these sites, their content, or their privacy policies. SAS does not endorse or make any representations about them or any information, software or other products or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them. If



 you decide to access any of the third-party sites linked to the SAS site, you do so at your own risk. 

<h3>Cookies</h3>
There are various technologies, including one called "cookies," which can be used to provide tailored information from a Web site.  A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system.  Some SAS 



pages use cookies or other technologies 
so that we can better serve you when you return to our site. We do not use cookies or similar technology to cross-relate personal information about our visitors. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.  For more information, please refer to user information provided with your Web browser.

<h3>Newsletters, Alerts and Invitations</h3>
If you register to receive newsletters, alerts or invitations, you will be asked to provide your e-mail address,
the topics in which you are interested, and other demographic information. Other information may also be necessary
depending on the type of newsletter or alert requested. This information is used solely to enable us to provide
the requested newsletters and alerts to you.  Some electronic communications may record anonymous data related
to the response.  Analysis of this data is solely for the purpose of improving our content and customer service.

<h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3>
You are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your information used for purposes not directly related
to our site at the point where we ask for the information.  For example, we provide an <a href="http://www.sas.com/apps/optout.jsp">'<u>opt-out</u>'</a> mechanism if you do
not wish to receive unsolicited email marketing materials from us and we will take reasonable steps to honor
such email opt-out requests.
 
<h3>Your Acceptance of These Terms</h3>
By using SAS' Web site, you signify your assent to this Privacy Statement.
If SAS updates or changes this Privacy Statement, the changes will be made on this page.
Your continued use of SAS' Web site following the posting of changes to this Privacy Statement
will mean you accept those changes.

<h3>How to Contact Us</h3>
Should you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Statement, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sas.com">privacy@sas.com</a>.
