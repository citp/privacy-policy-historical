SAS may set these types of cookies without requesting your consent. 
</p>
<p>
Other pages on the site may set cookies to collect aggregate usage information that we use to improve how the site works.

We collect information about how you consume this type of personalized information in order to help us provide you with other information that is better tailored to your interests. 
If you choose to visit one of these personalized web URL links, you are agreeing to allow SAS to collect information about your visits and also to associate that information with other information about you and your relationship with SAS.
